<HEAD>Gandhi Shuffles Cabinet; Inducts New Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> inducted 13 people into his <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday and reshuffled the portfolios of existing ministers. The reshuffle is the 12th since <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was sworn into office in January 1985 and comes one week before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s annual budget session is due to start. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> told reporters the council's expansion was meant to give more representation to various regions of the country and social groups. `` Since the last reshuffle, a lot of people had dropped out of the Cabinet and this had upset the balance. In this reshuffle we have tried to restore the balance,'' the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted him as saying. However, no Cabinet minister was named to head the External Affairs Ministry. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> himself handles the portfolio, aided by a junior minister. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> denied that the changes were a prelude to early elections to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` A snap poll is definitely out,'' <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. There are now 63 ministers in the council with 15 holding Cabinet rank, excluding <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Three of the new ministers were inducted at Cabinet rank. These include <PERSON> Bindeshwari </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Motilal </PERSON> <PERSON> Vora </PERSON>, who resigned as chief ministers of two Indian states Saturday. <PERSON> Dubey </PERSON>, who quit as chief minister of eastern <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, was named as Law and Justice Minister while <PERSON> Vora </PERSON>, who resigned from central <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, was given the Health and Family Welfare portfolio. The third, <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, re-entered the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> after 15 years as the Water Resources Minister. Cabinet Communications Minister <PERSON> Arjun </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> Madhya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pradesh </ORGANIZATION> Chief Minister on Saturday. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> dropped Agriculture Minister <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhillon </PERSON> from the Cabinet Sunday and also relieved a junior minister, <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulari </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinha </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sinha </PERSON> has been asked to become governor of southern <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state, a largely ceremonial post. The other inductions included four junior ministers and six deputy ministers. The other changes were mainly exchanges of portfolios between existing Cabinet ministers and junior ministers.

 A former Methodist minister accused in a civil suit of trying to choke his wife to death says he is innocent and has avoided his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> apartment to dodge reporters, not court officials. `` My response to the allegations in the suit are the same they have been all along: I'm not guilty of anything and do n't have anything to fear on that point,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> said in an interview in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News. `` I regret the lawsuit because it puts all the family _ the <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> family and me _ under an even added amount of pressure,'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> said in his first interview since he moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in November. Stories based on the interview were published in the newpaper's Saturday and Sunday editions. After <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s mother-in-law, filed the lawsuit Feb. 2, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> began living in hotels and with friends instead of in his apartment. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, former senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said he has stayed away from the apartment because news reporters and photographers have staked it out. `` I'm keeping a low profile because people are sitting out in front of my flat and I resent that,'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> said. `` I know the press is doing its job and I'm just trying to live my life. At this point, there seems to be difficulty in making both of those things work.'' The constant attention and news reports have made him weary and resentful, he said. `` I'm in a situation where my silence makes people wonder and, when I talk, the way it's used -LRB- in the media -RRB- also makes people wonder,'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> said, describing his position as being `` between the devil and the deep blue sea.'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has said he found his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, near death the night of April 21 in their garage. Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has been comatose since the attack and is in a Tyler nursing home. The lawsuit by Mrs. <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s mother, seeks unspecified damages. Court officers have been unable to locate <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> to serve him formal notification of the civil suit, but <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> denied `` trying to dodge the papers.'' He declined to review a copy of the lawsuit offered by the Morning News and said he wanted to first discuss it with his <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> declined to give an account of the night his wife was attacked, and he also declined to talk about his relationship with psychologist <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, who told a grand jury in July that she had been having an affair with <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>. Late last year and <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> signed a one-year lease on a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> flat. Before his wife was attacked last April, the prominent minister reported to police that he was receiving death threats that he blamed on his strong pro-civil-rights stance. Police later concluded that the threatening notes were typed on a church typewriter. The morning that police were planning to question <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> about the attack on his wife, he took an overdose of sleeping pills but later recovered. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has since resigned his church position.

At his first campaign stop of the day, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last Monday, warned his rivals _ particularly <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> _ that negative campaigning now could hurt the party's chance to win the presidency. `` We're not going to win this if we're brawling in the mud,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has been the target of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> commercials focusing on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman's votes in favor of the B-1 bomber and nuclear power. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, whose candidacy hinges on the support of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters on Tuesday, unveiled a new television commercial attacking <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for not being effective enough in the fight to get congressional approval of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> described <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as `` relatively passive on the issue'' of Contra aid. When the congressman was asked if his candidacy could survive a finish behind <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> on Tuesday, he replied: `` He's not going to beat me in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' Dog sled races in <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION> drew <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> went rummaging for votes at the <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> town dump. Noticing campaign workers for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> passing out literature at the dump, which attracts 400 to 500 people on a Saturday, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said, `` Here's a real candidate.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at an appearance in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, shrugged off criticism in a <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> television commercial that called him `` one of the biggest tax raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history.'' `` I've cut taxes five times in the last four years,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, adding that he did not want to see the Democrats letting themselves `` disintegrate into the kind of backyard squabbling that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> have been involved in.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> toured shopping malls on the seacoast, shaking hands and telling people, `` I need some help on Tuesday.'' The former evangelist told reporters, `` It's a horserace all the way, and I think we might see some surprises come Tuesday night. But the momentum is on my side right now and that's the good way to be at this stage.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared at a high school in <LOCATION> Wolfeboro </LOCATION> with Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and Hall of Fame baseball player <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and was on the offensive against <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> is making some statements that are pretty extravagant,'' said the vice president. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> says when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants something done he calls <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. But when he wanted somebody to be the vice presidnt of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he called me.'' In addition to his campaigning, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was the candidate featured this weekend in the televised interviews by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, part of the series called, `` The Next President.'' Asked about <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, the former television evangelist said, `` I would n't have hesitated to kill him. He's a madman and he was a terrorist.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> picked up the endorsement of former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> who dreamed of being one of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates but eventually decided against entering the race. Also appearing with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at <PERSON> Jaffrey </PERSON> was former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race on Friday and endorsed the Kansan. Addressing a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Conant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` Some people say <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is pretty tough. You better hope I'm tough. We're talking about our future. We're talking about our children's future We're talking about our grandchildren.'' It was clear that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> coupled with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s embarrassing third-place finish had blown away the big edge the vice president once held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> surveys <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> could be a last stand for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont, as well as for two Democrats, former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was confident he'd finish ahead of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the primary. Asked if he also had to beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, he replied, `` No, I've got to be competitive. I've got to be up in the pack among the leaders. And that's what our goal is.'' `` You have to do well, you have to start beating somebody,'' conceded du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who finished fifth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and is running the same in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> surveys. The new <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ad took swipes at both <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the Contra aid issue. The commercial said that in the recent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote that rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for more money for the Contras, eight <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters were among those who voted against the money. The ad also quoted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as telling the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> `` he was n't concerned about -LRB- Nicaraguan president <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> or his army Is that leadership?'' When reporters asked how <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> could attack <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, when the senator had voted for Contra aid, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said, `` Sure he's voted in the right place. But this guy has run for the last year on leadership. ... <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has been relatively passive on this issue.''

 Republican presidential contender Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has continued to spend thousands of dollars with a travel agency owned by the daughter and son-in-law of a former <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> political aide, a newspaper report said Sunday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> cut political ties with <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, his former chief fund-raiser and a former <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> lieutenant governor, after questions were raised last month about <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s business dealings. But according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records, the campaign of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., paid more than $ 80,000 in the last quarter of 1987 to International Tours of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> reported A <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman said the campaign decided it would be unfair to stop buying travel services from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, and his son-in-law, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` It seemed remarkably unfair to make <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> suffer more than she already has on a personal level,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the campaign's chief counsel. `` The agency has been providing services from the start,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Campaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s political action committee, had used International Tours and it `` seemed a natural continuation'' to use the travel agency in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presidential bid. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the campaign gets no price breaks on travel services, and said nothing was wrong with the relationship. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman generally agreed. `` As long as they're paying the going rate, there's no problem,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said such special treatment by a company could violate campaign finance laws against corporate contributions or individual contributions exceeding $ 1,000.

 Protesters fought police and detonated homemade bombs Saturday as opposition parties renewed their drive to oust President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. One person was killed and at least 34 injured. A general strike that continued Sunday shut down most shops and businesses in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and other major cities. Since the major opposition parties launched their anti-Ershad campaign last Nov. 10, there have been 24 days of general strikes. There were no reports of violence Sunday morning. Saturday's violence, in which nine people were arrested, comes on the heels of bloody street battles during local elections last Wednesday. The government on Saturday raised its official death toll from the election-day melees to 101. Most of the deaths occurred in clashes among supporters of rival opponents for seats on more than 4,370 village councils. Unofficial death counts in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> newspapers put the figure at 135. Hundreds were injured. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday she had reports of more than 350 deaths in the Wednesday rampages. In addition, confrontations between protesters throwing bricks and bombs and police firing rifles and tear gas have killed 25 people by the government's count, 100 by <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>'s count, since Nov. 10. On Saturday, like last Wednesday, much of the damage was done by homemade bombs, which are being used increasingly by political protesters here. One person was killed and at least 14 injured by a bomb thrown at a state-run bus in <LOCATION> Mirpur </LOCATION>, a northern suburb of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, witnesses and hospital officials said. <PERSON> Rahul </PERSON> <PERSON> Amina </PERSON>, a student who accompanied one of the bus victims to a hospital, said some injured passengers fled the scene for fear of being asked by police to be witnesses. Another bomb injured 10 people in central <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Ten other injuries were reported after police wielding batons clashed with about 100 slogan-shouting demonstrators near the capital's central office, witnesses reported. Police posted outside <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> accused students of hurling homemade bombs toward shuttered shopping centers nearby. No casualties were reported. Twenty-one of the country's major opposition parties began their campaign more than three months ago to force <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to resign. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 58, a former army general, took power in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> in a bloodless coup in 1982. He was elected to the presidency in 1986 in an election the opposition contends was rigged. In an effort to appease his political opponents, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and called for fresh elections March 3. The main opposition leaders say they will boycott the vote.

<HEAD>Health Cult Linked To Knox County Mummy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A family that secretly kept a mummified body in their home for more than eight years has been linked to a cult that preaches use of nutrients and exorcism in place of traditional medicine, investigators said. `` I think we are touching on something, a group that has n't been known before _ a group that is almost a secret society,'' <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said in a story published in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said those involved in the cult, known as the `` Holistic Society,'' included several suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> dentists, but he would not identify them because of pending investigations. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the man whose withered corpse was found in bed last month in his rural <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> home, was a diabetic who was persuaded to rely on vitamins and powdered mixes in place of his daily insulin injections, according to investigators and family members. His body was found more than eight years after he died May 12, 1979, at age 40. His brother also died at a relatively young age, and investigators were told that his death may also be related to unorthodox health practices. The <ORGANIZATION> Holistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> disdains traditional health methods and relies instead on an extreme form of `` holistic health care,'' in which the mind and body are treated with only natural vitamins, herbs and nutrients, <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. Treatments are administered in a quasi-religious fashion that involve the use of healing crystals, the exorcism of `` black souls or Satan,'' and `` channeling'' to communicate with spirits, <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. There is no evidence that the health cult is violent or guilty of anything other than encouraging bizarre health practices for the unwary, <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. In the weeks before his death, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had cut his daily insulin intake in half and was taking up to 20 vitamin pills a day, according to an aunt, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lambe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Knoxville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, died after vomiting a `` black substance,'' his 42-year-old wife, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, told investigators. The only criminal charges in the case were lodged against Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a former nurse, and former <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> dentist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, 56. Both are charged with forging the dead man's name on legal and bank documents and with cruelty to children. The <ORGANIZATION> Stevenses </ORGANIZATION>' teen-age son and daughter lived in the house with the mummified corpse. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who is in custody, and Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who is out on bond, have already pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to report <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' death. In another twist to the case, investigators say they found a `` travel permit'' from the right-wing Posse Comitatus anti-tax group in the wallet of <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who moved in with the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> family 18 months ago as their `` spiritual leader.'' <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> was introduced to the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> family by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' brother, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> lawyer who was apparently the first family member to become involved in the health cult, <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said Investigators and family members said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> persuaded his brother to use the vitamins and powdered mixes in place of his daily insulin injections, and said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> even began selling the substances from his office. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> died at age 43 in 1985 at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital. His death was attributed to gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hepatic cirrhosis. But a nurse who cared for him told investigators, `` I think it was his diet that killed him,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man who threatened to blow himself up in a bar with dynamite he'd strapped to his body was taken into custody by police early Sunday after four hours of negotiations. Authorities later found no explosives. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Allgood </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> walked out of the Plaza Lounge shirtless, following police instructions, and surrendered to authorities at about 12:10 a.m., said <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` The officers did not find any explosives. They did find a hoax device. People in the bar had seen something so we knew <PERSON> Allgood </PERSON> had something,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Bartender <PERSON> Ina </PERSON> <PERSON> Silloway </PERSON> said the man came into the bar shortly after 8 p.m. and walked around for a few minutes before ordering a 12-pack of beer to go. When she returned with the beer, she said, he handed her a Valentine's greeting card. `` It said something to the effect of, ` This is no joke. I have six sticks of dynamite strapped to me. If you look at me, I will show you,'' Ms. <PERSON> Silloway </PERSON> said. `` At that point I looked up and he showed me,'' she said, adding that the man told her he planned to `` commit police suicide.'' Police say <PERSON> Allgood </PERSON>, who was alone inside the bar, threatened to harm no one but himself. Police cordoned off the area, but because other nearby businesses were closed Saturday night there was no need for any evacuation, said officer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. Charges were pending against <PERSON> Allgood </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, but he would not specify what they involve.

His greatest strength would be the character issue, both its negative side and especially its positive side,'' the Republican former president wrote. `` No one will ever forget <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>,'' he wrote, referring to a July 1969 auto accident in which he was the driver and a woman passenger was killed. `` The question is whether people have forgiven him for it,'' he wrote. `` If the media hound <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> over that tragic accident 19 years agothey might well help him rather than hurt him _ and also land themselves in the political doghouse.''

 Four men tried to hijack a <ORGANIZATION> Tanzania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> but were overpowered Sunday after the pilot duped them into thinking he had flown them out of the country, sources said. Capt. <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngandile </PERSON> was stabbed in the neck and hand and his co-pilot, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mnika </PERSON>, suffered cuts on his hands when the hijackers slashed at them after realizing they had been tricked, said airline and security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said the injuries were not serious. None of the passengers on board the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 was injured. Officials said there were 70 passengers, including the hijackers, and a crew of six. The sources said the hijacking occurred Saturday night aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Tanzania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' flight between <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>, the capital, and <PERSON> Kilimanjaro </PERSON>, the northern town near the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> border. Passengers said at 9:17 p.m., about midway through the 50-minute flight, four men forced their way into the cockpit and threatened the captain and co-pilot with knives. Airline sources said the men demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, with a stop in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital, so the plane could be refueled. <PERSON> Ngandile </PERSON> told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough fuel to reach <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ababa </PERSON> and suggested he refuel instead at a small airport at <LOCATION> Ludwar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the sources said. The hijackers agreed. Instead of heading for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ngandile </PERSON> flew the plane in a wide arc and headed back to <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION> airport. He also managed to send a secret distress signal to the control tower at <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>. Airport officials turned off the terminal lights and some of the runway lights to give the appearance that the plane was landing at a small airport. The jet landed at about 10:30 p.m. Security forces called to the airport stormed the plane and took the men into custody. The four hijackers were described as residents of the semi-autonomous island of <LOCATION> Zanzibar </LOCATION>. They were believed to be between the ages of 16 and 20.

 Opportunity came knocking for undercover police officers who raided a house looking for drug dealers and ended up arresting their customers as they came to the door. The police street-crime unit had arrested four suspected drug dealers Friday and were searching their house when the first customer knocked on the door, said Lt. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Over the next few hours, the impromptu sting operation resulted in 18 unexpected drug arrests, police said. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the undercover cops intended only to arrest the dealers, but when the first would-be buyers knocked `` we decided to do a reverse sting operation.'' Seized from the house were about 80 bags of heroin, an unspecified amount of cocaine, $ 2,900 in cash, a loaded .38 - caliber revolver and assorted drug paraphernalia, police

<HEAD>Judge Says Building Owners Have Right To Name Of Legendary Saloon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The owners of the building that housed <PERSON> Tootsie </PERSON>'s Orchid Lounge, a legendary honky-tonk frequented in its heyday by country music celebrities, also own the right to the tavern's name, a judge has ruled. Chancellor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> ruled Friday that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>, son of the late club owner <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Tootsie </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>, lost his right to use the name when he closed the tavern in 1985 and did not renew the trade name registration his mother had filed 10 years earlier. <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON> had filed suit in 1986 charging that the building's owners, <PERSON> Mollye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> and her brother, <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, were illegally using the name of the tavern which his mother had operated there for 25 years `` What I want is my mother's name back,'' <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON> said when he filed the suit in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> and her brother did not invade <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>'s rights by registering the name `` World Famous Tootsie's Orchid Lounge'' with the secretary of state's office in July 1985, four months after <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON> closed the club Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> have leased the building to others, who have continued to operate the tavern since August 1985. Tootsie's was located across the alley from the backstage door of the Ryman Auditorium where the Grand Ole Opry was performed from 1943 to 1974. Parts of the movie `` Coal Miner's Daughter'' were filmed there, depicting the life of country music star <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> was famous for her hospitality and generosity, and her tavern became a well-known refuge for aspiring entertainers, musicians and songwriters, many of whom went on to achieve fame and fortune,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> wrote. But when the Opry moved to the Opryland theme park complex in the suburbs, country stars dropped in less often and business in general dropped off. Mrs. <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> died in 1978. Her son's decision to close the bar `` received considerable coverage in both the local and national news media. From all indications, <PERSON> Tootsie </PERSON>'s was closed for good,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> wrote.

<HEAD>Jewelry from Radium Dials Hot Item, Dangerous for Wearers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fad for jewelry made from the dials of old watches may pose a danger to unsuspecting wearers: Many of the old watches used radium to make them glow in the dark, and the radioactivity can cause cancer, health officials say. `` We're finding more and more of this stuff,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, supervisor at the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> regional office of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` People suddenly think it's cool to have necklaces, earrings, bola tie clasps and other things made with old watches.'' But the radium on some old watch dials can cause cancer, either on the skin or internally if the substance is inadvertently inhaled or swallowed. `` Like calcium, radium powder seeks the bone,'' he said. `` Radium jewelry definitely poses an increased risk of cancer,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. Radium was used in watches to make the hands and numbers glow, he said. Watch makers have since developed other ways to cause fluorescence. When the watches were intact, with glass covering the dial, they were relatively harmless because the glass acted as a shield. But the risk has increased since the watches have been dismantled to make jewelry, and the risk is even greater to jewelers and other people who work with the timepieces than it is to buyers, he said. Three workshops in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area that were found to be handling the watches all registered some radioactive contamination, he said. Workers were getting the radium on their fingers and clothes, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` We found several places in the work areas that were hot'' with contamination, he said. `` We're sure there are other places out there,'' he said. The work is illegal as well as hazardous, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. People who handle radioactive materials must have a state license and to get one, an applicant must take stringent precautions against contamination. The radiation control bureau did not issue citations but told companies to remedy the contamination, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> offered free testing of jewelry for radiation and free disposal of contaminated pieces, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Report: Nuclear Submarine Was Close To Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear accident was averted with minutes to spare aboard a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> submarine in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last month, the Observer newspaper reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> denied there had been a crisis. No public announcement had been made earlier about the incident. On Sunday, a ministry spokesman who would n't be identified said: `` There was no emergency. There was no possibility of anybody, crew or general public, being subjected to any radiation problems. There was a minor electrical malfunction but no radioactive material was released.'' The spokesman said the weekly was incorrect in claiming a nuclear accident was averted by minutes. The Observer said that, on Jan. 26, at the nuclear submarine base at Faslane near <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, a fault developed in the primary cooling system of the nuclear reactor power plant on HMS Resolution, the oldest of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four operational nuclear submarines, commissioned in 1967. The fault led to heat building up in the reactor's core, threatening a meltdown, and potential disaster was only averted when two of the crew ran to start up a diesel generator to provide alternative power for the cooler, the report said. It said there was only between 1 -LCB- and 7 minutes for the crew to take action and one of the two crewmen had to be scrubbed down for 24 hours afterward because he was exposed to radiation. A meltdown could have released radioactivity contaminating 2,000 square miles with `` devastating consequences'' for the 13,000 people living within a five-mile radius of the base, the report said.

 Round Springs Road is n't what most people would call a road. It's a path that winds around the bluff and dips twice into Round Springs before it reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. That's twice suppliers, buyers, and the occasional visitor have to drive through the shallow creek to get to the company located just outside <PERSON> Tia </PERSON> <PERSON> Juana </PERSON>, a small northeastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> community east of Disney There are a few electric saws and automated lathes and sanders at the wooden handle mill to hint that the Industrial Revolution once visited. And a home computer used in the office is proof the Computer Age stopped by. Of course, making wooden handles for tools and farm implements is a business that has n't changed much since <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> started the company in 1934. The only difference now is how fast a handle can be made with the help of machines, he said. <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> made some of the electric equipment used in the mill and other machinery was bought through the years as the company expanded. `` This is just a baby company compared to some of the others,'' <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> said. But co-owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who bought the company from the <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON>'s in 1981, is proud of this mill, the only company of its kind in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` We do n't try to compete with the others. We just make our product and do what we can,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. The 90-year-old <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> has been retired since 1961. He turned the business over to his two oldest sons, who ran it for more than 20 years before selling it to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The two had 20 years with the company between them when they took it over. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said business is fair at the mill, with 15 employees working on the three-acre operation producing an average of 5,000 handles a day that range from a 10-inch machinist handle to a 60-inch pitch fork handle. But business is n't as good as it was in 1975 when <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> joined a 35-man crew that produced as much as 10,000 handles a day. He blames that on a depressed state economy that has forced most businesses to cut back. The mill now operates on a temporary three-day work week in the slow winter season, but it wo n't be long before business picks back up and the company is flooded with orders, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` Right now we're trying to stockpile our supply so we can meet the demand in the spring when it comes,'' he said. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the company sells to lumber yards, hardware stores and other handle companies. State prisons also buy from the mill for their farming projects. <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> said he thinks the mill has manufactured and sold enough handles over the years to `` make a rick 8-foot high from here to <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>,'' a stretch of some 60 miles. <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> started the company in 1934 `` with a shave horse and a knife,'' making about a dozen handles a day. In 1942, they moved west to the remote wooded area it's nestled in now. `` We could n't get any good white hickory out of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>,'' he said. These days, the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gets an ample supply of hickory, ash, and red and white oak from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and some from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> really still is in the <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> family because he's married to <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON>'s granddaughter and calls him grandpa. And many of the employees are related or have the <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> name, he said. `` You're the one who started this thing,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON>. `` Sometimes we've got to get him in here to straighten things out.'' `` I may have started it, but I ca n't take all the credit,'' <PERSON> Willhite </PERSON> said. `` I'm not the one who finished it.''

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s communist leaders observed a minute of silence at a ceremony in the former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tet Offensive, a report seen Sunday said. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> attended the ceremony Friday in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> was renamed after the 1975 communist victory, the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. It said <PERSON> Vo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON>, the secretary of the city's party committee, told participants that the 1968 offensive against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Vietnamese forces `` had created the necessary prerequisites for the entire party, army and people to advance in the following years to total victory.'' `` The participants observed a minute of silence in memory of those compatriots and combatants who had fought heroically and laid down their lives in the fierce battles 20 years ago,'' the report said. An exhibition of photographs and relics of the offensive has been opened to mark the anniversary, the report added. The communists took enormous casualties in launching the Tet, or lunar new year, offensive beginning on Jan. 30, 1968, striking at more than 100 cities and towns across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Vietnamese forces turned them back, but the offensive convinced some Americans that the war was unwinnable and fueled the antiwar movement.

<HEAD>Debate Over Social Security Reform Remains Major Issue in Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary could be the last hurrah for several presidential candidates who have suggested radical changes in Social Security ranging from letting young workers opt out of the system to taxing all of affluent retirees' benefits But even if the candidates who stumped for those ideas are gone, Social Security will remain a hot issue in this presidential race, just as it was in 1984 and in the last three congressional elections. The likelihood is that it will also be a provocative topic in 1992 and every four years after that for the foreseeable future. Too many Americans have too much at stake in Social Security for it to be otherwise. `` This issue may be with us for the rest of our lives,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON>, pollster for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, the candidates most closely associated with calls for changes in Social Security, Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, took a shellacking. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who like du Pont favors privatizing some of Social Security, finished a strong second, but it was his stand on moral issues, not pensions, that galvanized his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> supporters. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who contends the system will crash in the next century under the weight of the retired baby boomers unless they are allowed to save their own retirement funds, finished a distant fifth. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Republicans' most vigorous defender of the status quo in Social Security, was fourth, but hoping to move up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with his unbridled attacks on Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting a freeze on Social Security in 1985. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, on the other hand, is telling voters everywhere he goes about his role on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, when the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator helped hammer out a last-minute compromise that put Social Security back in the black. `` You do n't have to worry about it being broke. You do n't have to worry about getting your checks. And there I made a difference,'' says <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who never fails to add that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> voted against the Social Security rescue plan. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman says he did so because of its increase in payroll taxes. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also argued that it was the improved economy and reduced unemployment that revived Social Security's fortunes. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s hard-hitting ad campaign against <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Social Security has rekindled memories of the way <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> hammered <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other Republicans for backing deep Social Security cuts in 1981. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of repeatedly misrepresenting his plan to allow workers to set up tax-free savings accounts if they relinquish future Social Security benefit rights. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> says <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s attacks `` remind me of the demagoguery practices by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the 1982 elections.'' Some Republicans, including <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, have said it was the Democrats' pounding on senior citizens' fear of Social Security cuts or freezes that cost the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. On the Democrats' side, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> has called for `` a universal needs test to discipline government programs,'' including Social Security, and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax on all their benefits instead of half. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits. The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguard Social Security and its <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION>'s. `` We're going to keep it away from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> budget knives forever,'' promises <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. Social Security's trust funds, which started 1988 with $ 67 billion, are expected to swell to $ 104 billion by the start of 1989 and to top $ 400 billion by 1994 and $ 1 trillion before the end of the decade. Ultimately, Social Security's trust fund is expected to peak at $ 12 trillion _ $ 2.5 trillion in today's dollars _ around 2020, then be drawn down to nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers' retirement <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> have argued that even before the trust funds are depleted, there will be nothing in there but government IOU's. To pay off those IOU's _ actually, interest-bearing <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds _ du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> says, `` we face a big tax increase.'' When du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> asked 80 people at a debate in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65, three people raised their hands. More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubious about their personal prospects for Social Security. But that sentiment has not translated into support for politicians such as du Pont and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> who suggest overhauling or even tinkering with Social Security. <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> pollster, said, `` The elites have attempted to move the debate in a direction the voters do n't want to move yet.'' Young voters do n't expect to get Social Security themselves, <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON> said, but they do expect it to be there for their parents. `` For all of the provocation, the voters are still on the side of protection,'' said <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON>. `` They understand that if the government does not provide those benefits, they are going to have to pay for their parents' retirement or health problems.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, skating on the edge of a fiscal disaster, was awaiting word from private bankers this week on whether they will accept a bailout scheme that could keep the country out of default. <PERSON> Ricaurte </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s planning minister, met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> late last week with a committee representing 150 commercial bank creditors in a new effort to keep the country afloat by delaying loan interest payments. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> owes the private banks $ 200 million in interest this year, with the bulk of it scheduled to come due in mid-March. But the country's dollar reserves are virtually depleted and it is unlikely it can meet its commitments. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> first met with the creditor committee in December and asked that $ 100 million of the interest due this year be added to the principal for future payment. The bankers were said to have shown little interest in that plan. It was not known if <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> offered the bankers a new bailout plan last week, but he said recently that his government might have to dismiss as many as 15,000 public employees next month to reduce its cash flow. One out of every four Panamanian workers is employed by the government, many owing their jobs to loyalty to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has close ties to the country's de facto leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Much of what little popularity <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still retains comes from the public sector,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat. `` If the government is forced to make layoffs in that sector, it obviously wo n't help <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s image.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been under pressure to resign since last summer from a broad but loose coalition known as the National Civic Crusade. It counts more than 200 civic, business, professional, labor and other groups as members. The opposition's charges of corruption against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were given added weight earlier this month when he was indicted by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on charges of drug smuggling, money laundering and racketeering. The general, who dominates the counry's civilian government as head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, sent his army into the streets last year to quell demonstrations by the Civic Crusade, and the opposition has increasingly turned to what one official called `` economic warfare.'' The tactics, which have added to the government's fiscal woes, include removal of deposits from state banks and the avoidance or late payment of utility fees and taxes. The Civic Crusade also has called several nationwide strikes, but none has been particularly successful. `` The Crusade's activities are an annoyance, I'm sure,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But that's a really small part of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problem.'' The problem, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> inherited, comes from a huge public debt rolled up by a predecessor, Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who came to power in a 1968 coup and began an ambitious program of building schools, health clinics, roads and other public facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> put <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s total foreign debt at $ 4.8 billion at the end of 1986, the latest year for which figures are available. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the government declared itself in `` informal, indefinite default'' to all governmental lenders last year, meaning it made no interest or principal payments. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted all aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government last year, and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> also cut off lending programs pending compliance by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> demand for a restructuring of its social security programs. Diplomats and private economists say the government has been loathe to make the reforms for fear of losing further popular support, particularly among the lower and middle classes who benefit most from the programs. The government's fiscal crisis appears to have had little effect on the private economy, particularly among the more than 120 foreign banks that maintain offices here and make <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> one of the Western Hemisphere's largest banking centers. `` The banking sector could face problems if the crisis deepens because it is highly dependent on a sense of confidence and stability,'' the diplomat said. `` But so far there have been no failures, nobody has pulled out and deposits remain relatively stable.''

 The military said Sunday it sent 4,000 troops to protect voters in the southern island province of <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION>, the last area to vote in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' violence-marred regional elections. The island's 214,000 voters are to choose three governors, 18 mayors and 126 members of town councils Monday in the final stage of balloting that began four weeks ago. About 50 Moslem bandits Friday attacked the southern island town of <LOCATION> Maimbun </LOCATION>, about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said Col. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abendan </PERSON>, head of the Philippine Constabulary of <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION>. He said four people were killed, three of them members of the Moslem rebel <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, bandits attacked <LOCATION> Kulasi </LOCATION> village just outside <LOCATION> Maimbung </LOCATION>, but no casualties were reported, he said. In nearby Luuk, rival political groups traded fire with automatic weapons, but there were no reported fatalities, he said. Col. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> said 4,000 marine and army troops have joined constabulary and special forces to prevent violence during voting in the largely Moslem province and Moro stronghold. `` We expect some disturbance after the voting, which is normal, especially when trends begin to show,'' <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> told reporters. Most Filipinos voted Jan. 18 in an election that President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said restored full democracy nearly two years after the ouster of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But voting was postponed in 11 of the 73 provinces because of fears of violence from communist rebels and regional warlords. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said Saturday that his department was studying proposals to assist the military against the 24,000-member communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> did not specify what measures were under review, but he previously has called for restoring the death penalty for rebels. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> also has proposed an unspecified `` package of legal weapons'' to enable the military to crush the 19-year insurgency. Such calls have led to speculation that the government was considering a limited state of emergency in some provinces. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters Friday she would await recommendations from <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> before deciding whether to impose emergency measures. Human rights groups have denounced such proposals. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> imposed martial law from 1972 to 1981 and said it was to prevent a communist takeover. The move helped fuel opposition to the administration that culminated in the February 1986 uprising that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The recent spate of skittish economic indicators is raising concerns that the next president will take office without the tools to combat a recession, even if an election-year downturn can be avoided. That's because the federal budget deficit has grown so huge that the historical remedies for jolting an economy out of a recession _ lower taxes and more federal spending _ simply will not be available to the next president, a growing number of analysts suggest. In fact, if anything, the next occupant of the Oval Office will be under extreme pressure to press for higher taxes to reduce the budget deficit _ a tactic that would become all but impossible during an actual recession. In 1981, when the last recession began, the federal budget deficit stood at $ 78 billion. By 1987, with the recovery from that recession entering its sixth year, the shortfall was $ 148 billion after soaring to a record $ 221 billion in 1986. The bloated budget deficits of the 1980s will make it that much harder for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor to cope with a recession, say analysts troubled by recent reports showing a faltering economy and by last week's <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that the deficit may hit $ 176 billion next year. Economists and political leaders are coming down with a good case of the jitters. `` The ability of the new president to use the discretionary parts of the budget, particularly large tax cuts, just are n't there,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, senior economist for <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanston </PERSON> and Co.. And <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, business school dean at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, suggests: `` The chicken is coming home to On Oct. 19 -LRB- the stock market plunge -RRB- he came looking for a place to roost but he did n't do it. He was just observed to be a very large chicken.'' So far, the focus has been on whether the nation will avoid an election-year recession that could spell disaster for Republican candidates. But, even if recession is escaped this year, many analysts see one lurking just around the corner _ perhaps in 1989. That would present <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor with painful policy choices from his very first day. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, passed in 1985 and revised last year, the budget deficit is supposed to be trimmed to $ 136 billion next year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in a rare show of cooperation, cut a deal in the aftermath of the stock crash spelling out broad outlines of a package to do just that. White House budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says that the fiscal 1989 budget that the president submits to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next week will hit that $ 136 billion target on the nose, even though `` it will be close.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> has cast serious doubt on that projection with its report last week that the federal deficit in fiscal 1989, which begins next Oct. 1, would miss the Gramm-Rudman target by $ 40 billion even under terms of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House-Congress </ORGANIZATION> budget compromise. If a recession hits, all bets are off. Both the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> projections assume that growth will slow in 1988, not be negative. -LRB- A recession is usually defined as a decline in the gross national product for two consecutive quarters, after adjustments for inflation. -RRB- Deficits usually expand in recessions because tax revenues are off at the same time demand for government benefits rises. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, suggests that if the nation gets lucky and a recession does n't arrive by 1989, it could present a rare chance to get the government's fiscal house in order. `` It can be done in the early years of the next president,'' <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> and many other economists say major reductions in the deficit likely will require new taxes _ a course <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has steadfastly resisted throughout his term. Of all the presidential candidates, only Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbit </PERSON> advocates higher taxes to reduce the deficit even though all 13 _ six Republicans and seven Democrats _ give reducing the deficit a top priority. Economic consultant <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Choate </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> says that regardless of whom is elected, barring a recession, `` the next president will raise taxes.'' The case for a tax increase `` is now much stronger than it was in 1984,'' when Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> braved much political derision to advocate one, says <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>. Still, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>, economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, argues: `` Given the softness of the economy, it would be hard to find a worse time to talk about a significant tax increase.'' Either way _ a painful recession or a major tax increase _ the economic policy options facing the next president will be limited and difficult. `` The question is: who would want to win control of the White House or the Congress this time? Maybe that's why nobody is running,'' jokes <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> says she struggles daily to pay her bills, and she counts on the $ 161 royalty check she gets each month from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> to help stretch her Social Security income But Exxon officials claim Mrs. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, a widow, owes the Houston-based company $ 37,000, because oil pumped from her property and sold in the late'70s and early'80s was overpriced. `` There's no way in the world I could pay that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said last week. `` I'd have to sell everything I've got. And I do n't know if that would do it or not. Mrs. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> is one of 2,300 defendants named in an Exxon federal class-action lawsuit. The list of defendants includes a millionaire or two and other oil companies. It also includes the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and school districts. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is suing because a federal court decided in 1983 that the company had overcharged customers for oil pumped from the defendants' land. The court ordered <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to refund $ 895.5 million, and now <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> wants the royalty owners to help with the restitution. The defendants argue that they should not have to pay for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s errors. `` They got their fingers caught in the till and now they want the people in <LOCATION> Hawkins </LOCATION> to pay it back,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>'s stepson. He is being asked for $ 49,000. Many defendants live in this pine-forested community of about 1,300. They are original landowners, their heirs, or beneficiaries who receive royalties _ a portion of proceeds from the sale of oil and gas pumped from their property. The <LOCATION> Hawkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> lies about 4,400 feet below ground. It was discovered in 1940; in 1975, landowners and heirs agreed to let <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> pump the field as a unit, believing they could increase its production and extend its life. Oil from the <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> should have been priced according to federal regulations implemented during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, but the federal government charged <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> did not follow the regulations. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> claimed the overpricing was the result of interpretations of complicated federal pricing guidelines. As <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> appealed the restitution order, and lost, the sum swelled to $ 2.1 billion because of interest. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement distributed by spokesman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, said that since owners' payments were based on the disallowed higher prices, they should expect to help pay the refund <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it warned royalty owners that its prices were being challenged and they might have to pay back some money they received, and said the court permitted it to seek repayment. The company settled with about 1,500 defendants, but time was running out so the suit was filed, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` None of the interest owners told us not to pay them at that higher rate. No one told us to pay them the lower rate,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. `` I had nothing to do with it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, 62. `` They did n't consult me when they priced the oil. They did that themselves.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> sent her a letter asking her to settle, but `` I did n't get that kind of income.'' Royalty owners receive about one-eighth of the proceeds from the sale of oil and gas pumped from their property. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is seeking $ 104,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which has elementary, middle and high schools, said Superintendent <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. `` Any time you take $ 100,000 from a program, it's going to affect it,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. He's not sure where the district's $ 4.2 million budget would be cut if forced to pay, but expects the elementary school would lose a planned computer lab. Some defendants are heirs and are being asked to pay back money spent by their parents. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> inherited his interest from his father. `` They sent me a notice that I owed them $ 49,000. I only had it -LRB- the royalty ownership -RRB- for three years,'' he said. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 82, settled. The settlement includes an agreement not to discuss figures. `` I do n't think I should have owed it but it seemed as if I was going to have to pay, so I got it off my mind,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I got them down to an agreeable sum.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he paid with royalty money he had saved and invested. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramblett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> attorney, represents <ORGANIZATION> Jarvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <PERSON> black </PERSON> college in <LOCATION> Hawkins </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a philanthropic organization; and several individuals. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> wants the foundation to repay $ 4 million, he said. `` Our first line of defense is that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has no right under the government regulations to seek this restitution,'' said <PERSON> Bramblett </PERSON>. `` They set the price on the oil and gas and if they made the mistake it's their problem.'' Hundreds of royalty owners have chosen to wait for the outcome of the suit, which does not yet have a trial date. `` I ca n't afford an attorney,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said.

 It looks like an ordinary set of false teeth, but it's mounted in something that looks like a machine-shop drill press. `` It does n't look like an artificial mouth, but it works like one,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who directs the Artificial Resynthesis Technology study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. Scientists are using a pair of the bulky machines, the only ones of their kind, to test dental products and conduct other kinds of research. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and his colleagues can duplicate the rigors of a year of chewing in a single day. That, he says, offers hope for vast improvement in the quality of dental fillings and crowns and in scientists' ability to understand the forces of chewing and digestion. Without the new technology, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> explains, manufacturers must test and prove the durability of their wares in the mouths of real subjects. Years of grinding and chomping must go by before researchers can judge a product's merit. `` If you put this together, you have an investigative tool,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, 50, who left a research post in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> to do research at the university. `` If you have an obedient artificial mouth which is believable, you have something to enable you to approach many tough problems that otherwise would be very difficult to do.'' The mouth began taking shape when <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> joined the dental research staff at <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in 1978. His endowed chair is partly funded by <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Maplewood </LOCATION>. 3M is a leading manufacturer of fillings, crowns and other dental products. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> soon learned of a company, <ORGANIZATION> MTS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in suburban <LOCATION> Eden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION> that builds test equipment with the precision and sophistication he needed to replicate mouth dynamics in the laboratory. Along with colleagues <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> and R.L. <PERSON> Sakaguchi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> adapted MTS equipment to build the mechanical mouths. The next step was artificial saliva. A researcher at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> has learned how to make it, and he sends <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and company quantities to use with the mouth. Jets shoot the saliva and other lubricants between test teeth the way ducts do in real life. Along with the mouth, the dental researchers have developed computer imaging technology that maps precisely where and how teeth wear out. `` It's a very painstaking procedure right now, where you're marking on teeth ... and measuring them,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Poxon </PERSON>, international professional services manager for 3M `` This computer imaging is the state of the art in dental materials research. It really does give you an accurate picture of what's happening.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has other, more ambitious dreams for his mouth. Now, it chews only in the sense that it simulates the wear-and-tear of chewing. He wants it to masticate fully _ to grind, break down and even swallow food. The next step: development of artificial tongues and cheeks. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> is poring over scientific papers for background while he prepares applications for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> grants to finance more work in that direction. `` I want to figure out how this thing can give a good simulation of what happens in the human mouth. For that you need a tongue and cheek mechanism,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. `` It's very tough. It's a very difficult thing to do.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> sees a complete artificial mouth as a research tool for food-product development, a field in which tenderness, texture and `` mouth feel'' possess tremendous importance. The artificial mouth would be able to quantify precisely the oral effort Product X would demand of the consumer. `` You have an instrument that can figure out just how much mastication has to go into that beef,'' he said.

 Some youth gangs are taking a corporate approach to selling drugs, complete with accounting and marketing divisions and bonuses for top salesmen, according to <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers. `` This is a street version of Wall Street. It's straight out of any graduate school of business,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an adjunct professor of criminal justice and one of five researchers in a five-year study on gangs. He cited as an example <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` White Boy <PERSON> Rick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who recently was sentenced to life in prison for selling cocaine in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` Kids are still talking -LRB- about -RRB- his trappings and how he was rolling. In the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Denby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, he's a legend,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and his associates studied gangs in three cities, including two `` corporate'' bands of hoods in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where the study was focused. The researchers interviewed gang members on street corners and in nightclubs, aided by a researcher who was a former gang member. They found that in the corporate gangs some members would be assigned to marketing, checking out neighborhoods to assess potential sales and what competition, if any, existed. They would report back to gang leaders who would decide whether to enter that market. Other members were assigned to do the actual selling. If they did well, they could be promoted to distributor and put in control of larger amounts of drugs. Distributors also were responsible for keeping books. Like companies in search of excellence, gang leaders would reward top salesmen with bonuses such as cars, trips, money and clothing. `` With the new corporate entity, they will do anything to further and protect their goals,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` It's the ` in' thing to be a White Boy <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> or Young Boys Incorporated That role model has replaced Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and pro athletes. The ramifications are so deep it's scary.'' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> police say <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s thesis has some merit, but that corporate gangs are not that widespread. `` More and more of these operations are operating like businesses,'' said narcotics inspector <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` These things are planned for and these things are well-arranged. It's almost as if they've had professional guidance. He said older adults are usually the top leaders of drug organizations and the number of youths running such operations has declined since the days of <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a notorious <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> drug ring that operated in the 1970s. And, he said, the organizations do not always evolve from gangs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> speculated that young criminals' ability to structure a drug business may come from watching how the legal system operates or taking advice from attorneys and other professionals. As efficient as corporate gangs might appear, there is no dominant drug distributor in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, police say. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s problems are shared nationwide and extend from the inner cities to wealthy suburbs, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, adding that the greatest threats to corporate gangs are crackdowns, capitalism, and relatively inexpensive crack cocaine. Big activity by a corporate gang often prompts big interest from the government, including the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, and the combined forces of the government can bring down a gang. But crack can bring about the breakdown first. The drug, far cheaper than powder cocaine, has inspired many young entrepreneurs to split off from their corporate gangs and head out on their own. `` It's their version of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

 Police used tear gas to subdue rioting fans at a professional wrestling tournament, and two officers were injured in scuffles, a police spokesman said Sunday. Lt. <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> said one officer was hit in the face and chest by a bottle-wielding spectator, and another was hit on the head with a chair during the Saturday night disturbance. He said an unspecified number of `` angry, berserk'' fans were arrested, most of them for using obscene language. The cause of the violence was not immediately known. The crowd had gathered for a tournament that featured an appearance by a West German wrestler known as `` Mighty Rambo.''

<HEAD>Insider's Critique: Failure To Curb Leaks Helped Spawn Iran-Contra
Errors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration might have avoided its Iran-Contra mistakes if it had the political nerve to stand by its plan to curb leaks with widespread polygraph tests and expanded censorship. `` The administration paid a real price'' for backing off President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-leak order in 1984, said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, architect of the plan known as National Security Decision Directive 84. `` That price showed up most clearly in Iran-Contra: people were so afraid of leaks from official channels that they bypassed those safeguards. They adopted all these other approaches that resulted in inadequate consideration and scrutiny,'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said in an interview before he leaves government this week for private practice. Presidential and congressional investigations said the fear of leaks was a prime motive for <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides to rely on shadowy businessmen to carry out <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Contra policies while keeping key <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet members in the dark. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> believes if these people had been consulted they would have prevented the mistakes. Although <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> became a symbol of government secrecy during the anti-leak fight, the 39-year-old lawyer operated quite openly during seven years at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ whether he was devising changes in intelligence policy or planning drug tests for federal employees. Looking back, he said the administration's biggest victories _ such as raising public concern about drugs and adding new drug agents and drug tests _ show the importance of altering public opinion before changing government policy. And its biggest disappointments, including on-and-off support for <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, reveal the folly of trying to sneak new policies through the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political thicket, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, who served at Justice longer than any other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee, now heads its civil division. But he started as intelligence policy counsel to Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who named him to head the inter-agency team that drafted the anti-leak order. That order would have subjected the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who see classified papers to possible firing if they refused to take polygraph tests in leak investigations. Other thousands with access to the deepest secrets would have to let the government censor their speeches and writings for life. The order enraged editorial writers, many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, authors and publishers, public employee unions, civil liberties groups, and _ privately _ even some of <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>'s colleagues at Justice. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> became the directive's only public defender and was, as he put it, `` castigated daily in the columns of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'' for most of a year. The pressure forced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to replace the order with a small polygraph test program in the Pentagon. `` The administration showed a lack of political nerve to deal with this problem, because they were afraid to take on the press,'' which paid more attention than the order deserved, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said. `` This administration has had its greatest problems where we just try to change public policy without changing the overall climate of ideas in the country,'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said. `` You have real problems given the balance of power in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and entrenched interest groups. `` No one thought then that the leak order would solve all the problems or even most of them; it was part of an effort to get a better climate of ideas about leaks.'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said. `` But people like <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> -LRB- then <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director -RRB- and others who should have had an equally strong interest did not think it was important to defend and deal with the public.'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had the same problem with his failed military mission to rescue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` People who could have helped make the project a success were not brought into it because of the fear of leaks. `` I feel the same way about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said. `` It was a mistake early in this administration to do so much covert action without developing public support.'' Among administration successes, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said, `` the whole drug issue, not just drug testing but the broader change of attitudes about drugs in this country, is a remarkable turnabout since the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration'' when some localities dropped criminal penalties for minor drug use. And he cited his own 3-year-old effort to reduce soaring damage awards in liability cases. `` Our strategy was to emphasize the need for reform across the board, rather than say, ` We need this federal statute and all our problems will be solved'.'' Federal revisions still have not passed, but, after many speeches and sending reports to every state legislator, `` in 1986 and 1987, 47 of the 50 states adopted one or more of our recommendations to limit liability,'' he said. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> said if he had one thing to do over `` I would have tried to get the senior national security and intelligence people to undertake more of a personal commitment to the leak policy before committing so much of my own effort and reputation.'' After that battle, Attorney General <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmults </PERSON> volunteered to a newsman that `` Willard wo n't be nominated to head the civil division or any post requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation so long as <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and I are here.'' He was n't nominated until <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> became attorney general.

<HEAD>Judges Jailing More People Awaiting Trial for Federal Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judges used broad discretion granted under the newly enacted Bail Reform Act of 1984 to jail a sharply higher percentage of people awaiting trial for federal crimes, the government said Sunday. The chances of being jailed while awaiting trial for people accused of serious narcotics violations were 20 percent higher after the law took effect than previously, said the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. After the bail reforms took effect in November 1984, the probability of being jailed was 63 percent higher for people accused of causing injuries. It was 23 percent higher for those who had used firearms and 17 percent higher for those classified as dangerous during pre-trial interviews. Overall, 29 percent of the defendants awaiting trial on federal criminal charges were incarcerated until they appeared in court. This was an increase from 24 percent who were held during the same period in 1983. The study was based on information collected during a six-month period in 1985. The act permits federal courts to deny bail altogether if the government proves that no conditions of release will reasonably assure either the safety of the community or the appearance of the defendant at trial. The report suggests that pre-trial detention is being used as an alternative to holding people under high bail.

 Security forces Sunday dispersed more than 400 demonstrators who gathered in a downtown square to demand human rights. Five people were arrested after police broke up the protest, which began after an official observance of the 43rd anniversary of the Allied bombing of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. Church leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Sunday the five detainees were released after questioning. There were no reports of injuries. The protesters unfurled banners demanding more human rights and called on the communist East German government to allow freedom of travel to the West. Many shouted `` The Wall Must Go!'' and `` We want freedom!'' It was the first time a demonstration of that size had taken place in the city, protesters said. Communist authorities in 1961 erected a heavily fortified wall between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The barrier also divides <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. As the protesters prepared to leave the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> square, police moved in and dragged away the five activists and detained them briefly in the nearby Palace of Culture. Police blocked an attempt by other demonstrators to storm the building. The square then was cleared by at least 100 uniformed and plainclothes police. On Saturday afternoon, several protesters raised banners demanding more freedom during a ceremony marking the Allied bombing of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> on Feb. 13, 1945. The banners were quickly ripped down and confiscated by security forces. Witnesses said one man was arrested for carrying a banner that read, `` Freedom for Those Who Think Differently.'' More than 100 people were arrested in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last month for attempting to demonstrate at a state-sanctioned rally honoring the founders of the German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. East German authorities have since expelled more than 60 of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> dissidents, including several prominent East German artists. Four protesters were arrested last week during a visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON>.

 Instead of calling the witness to the stand, Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON> asked him to `` please step over to the telephone speaker.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, who wore no judicial robes, was conducting an experiment in trying a case by conference telephone call.

So <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> scheduled the court session by telephone. That saved the defendants and attorneys a second trip to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, which would have cost $ 1,500 in air fare alone, <PERSON> Soileau </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what the cost of the phone call will be, but it will be substantially less,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ginther </PERSON>, who is based here, is seeking $ 13,525 in appraisal services he said he performed for <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metairie </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, plus interest and attorneys' fees.

 Firecrackers, dragon floats and even a banner reminding illegal aliens they can still seek amnesty were part of the celebration as thousands began ringing in the Chinese New Year over the weekend. People jammed the streets of <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> on Saturday for a multiethnic celebration of the Chinese lunar year 4686, the year of the dragon, although the year actually begins Wednesday. A parade featuring beauty queens, floats, firecrackers and hundreds of people in colorful costumes wound through the streets. Mixed with the traditional Chinese new year sounds of cymbals and gongs were musical notes from Scottish bagpipes and rhythms produced by Aztec drums. `` It's just a cultural shock,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, who attended the parade for the first time. `` It's really interesting to see the different nationalities represented here.

Dragons of all sizes, and appearing in nearly every color, pranced through the streets.

 Thousands of people weary of the cold, snowy <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> winter put on shorts, kicked off their shoes and went barefoot at the beach ... inside the Metrodome. Barefoot children built sand castles in more than 400 tons of sand that was dumped on the stadium's floor Saturday as part of <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Break </LOCATION>, billed as `` <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s midwinter beach party.'' `` We could n't get to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> this year, so this is our second-best bet,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frailich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, who was with his wife, <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON>, and their three children. `` We deserve it.'' Of course, it did n't matter that the grass was artificial turf, that the palm trees were plastic and that the ocean view was only a painted backdrop. It did n't matter because high temperatures over the past week were mostly in single digits with overnight lows below zero, and several inches of snow cover the ground in most places around the metropolitan area. The dome took on a carnival atmosphere, complete with <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> wheel, merry-go-round, 75-foot high-diving platform, music stage, volleyball courts, reggae bands and simulated windsurfing in front of a powerful fan. Among the people wearing shorts were Jan and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Riese </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fridley </LOCATION>, who took photos they intend to send to friends in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It's not quite as good as being there, but it's a lot cheaper,'' she said. `` We're having a ball.''

<TEXT>
 A restaurant employee at a five-star hotel poured fuel alcohol into a hot stove Sunday and triggered an explosion that left six people dead, police said. The victims died of asphyxiation after they were trapped on the 31st floor of the Hotel International in the <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Oerlikon </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Laetsch </PERSON> told reporters. Thirty people were in the restaurant when fire broke out, he said. It was not immediately known whether the dead were patrons or employees of the restaurant. Police said the flames were fed by the synthetic carpeting in the restaurant. Rescuers feared at first the swimming pool located on the top floor of the 32-floor high-rise might collapse. One fireman was hospitalized with respiratory complaints. Witnesses said fire alarms at the hotel, owned by the Swiss national airline <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION>, sounded only after a delay. An elevator reserved for the fire department failed to work, so equipment had to be carried up the stairs, local fire official <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berner </PERSON> said. The restaurant, popular for its panoramic view, had no automatic sprinkler system, duty manager <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadelmann </PERSON> said. About 180 people escaped safely from the hotel, including the employee apparently reponsible for the fire. Police said he was in a state of shock and could not immediately be questioned. About 100 firemen using gas masks mobilized for the blaze, one of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s most serious in recent years. Firefighters needed two hours to bring the blaze under control. The victims were found under the smoking rubble of the restaurant. <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> authorities launched an investigation. Officials estimated the damage at hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<HEAD>Court Records: Eldest Ray Brother Suffers From AIDS-Related
Complex</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The eldest of three hemophiliac brothers banned from attending elementary schools in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> because they carry the AIDS virus has now developed AIDS-related complex, court records show. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 11, has begun to show some symptoms of the disease, but he does not have a severe or life-threatening illness stemming from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, his doctor said. `` <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s ARC is stable, and he is showing no signs of progression,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>, a specialist in pediatric hematology and oncology at All Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. `` He should be able to continue performing daily activities. `` He never posed a threat -LRB- of spreading the AIDS virus -RRB- in the past, and he does n't pose a threat to anyone in the present,'' said <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> is taking the anti-AIDS drug AZT, and <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said the boy is `` full of energy. His lymph nodes are no longer swollen.'' <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s two brothers, 10-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and 8-year-old <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, remain in good health, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said a diagnosis of ARC does not automatically mean a patient will develop AIDS, a fatal disease that destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to infections and cancer. ARC is a condition caused by the AIDS virus and has a specific set of symptoms, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said. Those symptoms are often less severe than the symptoms of AIDS. The AIDS virus is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring. Doctors believe the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> brothers were injected with tainted plasma-based medication they received to clot their blood. School officials in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the boys attend school, said Friday they expected some mild reaction from parents once the news of <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s condition spreads. `` Every time there is a story about the Rays or AIDS in general, there is some response from parents,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coose </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Gocio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the Ray boys attend. `` But that reaction has always been minor.'' The boys' medical records are on public file as part of a lawsuit filed against the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> by their parents, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> filed the results of the Ray boys' Feb. 2 physical examinations in federal court Friday. The Ray brothers were banned from regular classes in <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in August 1986 after they tested positive for AIDS antibodies. A federal judged ordered their return to the classroom. On the fifth day they returned, a fire destroyed their home. Authorities ruled the fire was deliberately set, but no arrests were made. The Rays moved to <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> with the boys and their 6-year-old sister Candy, who is not infected.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> called Sunday for shifting Social Security to a privately based system over a 40-year period. He also accused Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> _ without naming him _ of `` demagoguing'' on Social Security. Interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> show `` Face the Nation,'' the former television evangelist said, `` I am absolutely committed to preserving the benefits of our elderly citizens. ... I do n't want to cut Social Security.'' But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that for younger workers between ages 20 and 40 `` there is n't going to be any money. Social Security is going to be broke by the year 2015.'' To replace it, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would allow people to `` take a little bit of their Social Security and put it into an actuarially sound, interest baring account, tax-free, like an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> so that over a period of time they can build up gradually so they own their retirement.'' Asked directly if he planned eventually to do away with the current, government-based system, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied, `` Over 40 years, moving into a private system.'' Would that require a reduction of benefits, he was asked. `` You do n't ever reduce benefits,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` I've got one of my opponents right now in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who's demagoguing all four of us on Social Security,'' he said. `` I'm not going to be demagogue.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> refused to identify the candidate but it was an apparent reference to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> who has criticized the others in advertising and debates on the Social Security issue. In contrast to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> insists the system is sound. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> talked to a congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, about his life and his campaign, both of which he said had been guided by God's messages. He suggested to the congregation that he might win here _ contrary to the polls that show Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> fighting for the lead in Tuesday's primary `` I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the television anchormen's faces when they have to report that <PERSON> pat </PERSON> <PERSON> robertson </PERSON> won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' the former television evangelist said.

 The meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> showed that despite differences on foreign policy, trade and narcotics trafficking, U.S.-Mexican relations are improving. The new atmosphere is due in large part to what one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official called the `` excellent personal working relationship'' between the two leaders, who have met six times over the past five years. `` On the basis of personal friendship ... we have reviewed matters of interest ... overcoming delicate matters,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said in welcoming <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to this <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal resort Saturday. The two chief executives, accompanied by high-ranking officials of their administrations, met for four hours Saturday to discuss issues of common concern, including trade, narcotics trafficking and Central American policy. It was the last officially scheduled meeting between the two presidents. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> ends his six-year term on Nov. 30, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves his post in January. Unlike some of his predecessors, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has avoided open confrontations with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government over foreign policy. Instead, he tends to stress the positive. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has been a tempering influence among Latin American leaders under domestic pressure to declare moratoriums on their enormous foreign debts, much of which is owed to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks. In turn, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been instrumental in getting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks to agree to refinance portions of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s enormous foreign debt of $ 105 billion, and to lend this country the money it badly needs for development. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has drawn praise from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drastically lowering its trade barriers and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has responded by opening up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market to Mexican textiles, leather goods and other products. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has strongly pushed the market-opening moves as a way to help modernize the sickly <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> economy and pull it out of its lengthy economic crisis. A perennial source of irritation had been the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was not doing its best in the fight against illegal drug trafficking because of official corruption. But the Mexicans now have practically forced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to admit that there is corruption on both sides of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and that the drug fight must be a joint effort. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is a large producer of marijuana and heroin for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market and a relay point for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cocaine. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stressed the importance of the anti-narcotics campaign, saying <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was an example of a situation where drug traffickers can become a powerful and disruptive factor in a society. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general was assassinated recently by drug dealers, responsible for the deaths of numerous judges and other government officials. High-ranking Mexican officials have privately expressed the fear that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could become another <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> avoided any references to official Mexican corruption, a charge often made in the past by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at lower levels. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is waiting for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the new Mutual Legal Assistance Pact that would enable police agencies in both countries to exchange information to track down drug criminals on both sides of the border. Problems remain between the countries, but it is an indication of the new relationship that the two neighbors can talk about them without sounding like a debate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> openly spoke of his support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, who are funded by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That is a sore topic for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which backs a political, not a military, solution to the conflict in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> also urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to eliminate any further barriers to exports from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration laws must take into account the rights of Mexican migrant workers. `` In the past five years, we have demonstrated that we can cooperate to achieve creative, mutually beneficial solutions,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. `` This is a valuable legacy that we leave to our successors.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Sunday its forces fired on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters flying ahead of a convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had no evidence that the attack happened. An Iranian naval commander, speaking in an interview reported by state-run <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, said the incident occurred Friday evening. The attack would have happened about the same time an Iraqi warplane fired two cruise missiles at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Sirri island that came within eight miles of the convoy. The commander, whose name was not given, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reconnaissance helicopters were fired upon as they operated over the islands of <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> and neighboring <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> and the oil platforms of Salman and <PERSON> Nasr </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pool reporters who were with the convoy that night said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters were aloft about the time that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired on the aircraft, and that the sound of anti-aircraft guns was detected from <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> after the Iraqi missile exploded there. But they also said that the exchanges happened within a span of about 20 minutes and it was unclear whether the Iranians were firing at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters or in reaction to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raid. The Iranian naval commander said Iranian troops fired warning shots and issued radio warnings to the helicopters, then opened direct fire after the warnings went unheeded, driving the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters away. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Morger </PERSON>, said Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had heard the reports, but `` at this point in time we just have no reports to indicate that anything like that occurred.'' The convoy completed its journey Sunday when it arrived in international waters off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>., <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said in a statement The convoy, escorted by the cruiser USS Chandler and the frigate <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, formed Thursday in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting 11 U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July to protect them from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which considers <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> an ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It was the <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> crew that reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles came within eight miles of it on Friday. Although the convoy apparently was not the intended target, the <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> fired flares to warn the Soviet-built Badger bomber to change course, after which one of the projectiles passed close to the American ships, officers The disclosure that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used C-601 missiles, the air-fired version of the Silkworms that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> deploys on the ground, has led gulf shipping executives to believe that that was the same type of missile that struck the Danish supertanker <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Maersk </PERSON> the night before. The tanker was towed Sunday to a port outside the gulf. A Danish seaman was killed in the attack and three others were wounded. During their 7-year-old gulf war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has attacked Iranian oil tankers while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has retaliated by attacking neutral ships in the gulf.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Tanzania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> pilot tricked four hijackers into believing he had flown them to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, then landed his plane at a Tanzanian airport where troops overpowered and arrested the young men Sunday. Capt. <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngandile </PERSON> also managed to send a secret distress signal to the Dar es Salaam airport, which turned off its terminal and runway lights, making it look like a small Kenyan airport, authorities said. After landing, the pilot stalled the assailants, telling them they would have to wait until daylight to refuel the plane. Just before dawn army troops stormed the plane and arrested the hijackers. The hijackers stabbed Ngandile in the neck and hands after they realized they had been tricked. His co-pilot, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mnika </PERSON>, suffered cuts on his hands. The injuries were not serious, said airline and security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among the 70 passengers on the Saturday night flight were two senior government officials _ Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Muhidin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimario </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, deputy minister for finance, economic affairs and planning. None of the passengers was hurt. Officials said the four hijackers arrested Sunday made no political statements or claimed any affiliations and that their only demand was to be flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 carried a crew of six on the internal flight between <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>, the capital, and <PERSON> Kilimanjaro </PERSON>, a northern town near the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> border and the site of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kilimanjaro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s highest mountain. <PERSON> Shihata </PERSON>, the government-owned news agency, said the four hijackers were from <LOCATION> Zanzibar </LOCATION>, the semi-autonomous <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation that with the mainland forms the Republic of <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. It said they were aged between 17 and 20. `` The hijackers carried two toy guns, a knife and a fake grenade,'' <PERSON> Shihata </PERSON> reported. The hijacking occurred at 9:17 p.m. Saturday, midway in the 50-minute flight. `` After takeoff, three youths stormed into the cockpit and announced that the flight had been hijacked and that they were going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' government-owned Radio <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> reported. <PERSON> Ngandile </PERSON> told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough fuel to reach <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ababa </PERSON> and suggested he refuel instead at a small airport at <LOCATION> Ludwar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the sources said. The hijackers agreed. Instead of heading for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ngandile </PERSON> flew the plane in a wide arc and headed back to <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>. After he sent the secret distress signal, airport officials turned off some airport lights. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 landed about 10:30 p.m. and taxied to the old Dar es Salaam terminal. After a wait of several hours, army troops stormed the plane and arrested the hijackers. In 1984, four men claiming to be members of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanzania </ORGANIZATION> hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Tanzania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet on an internal flight from <LOCATION> Mwanza </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> trading center in western <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>. The hijackers demanded the resignation of then President <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON>, blaming his socialist policies for <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>'s deplorable economic condition. They forced the pilot to fly the plane to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the four men surrendered peacefully. The Tanzanians were tried and convicted and sentenced to prison terms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> retired from the presidency in 1985 but still holds the most powerful political position in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> country as leader of the ruling party.

 This little town of 260 people will have a community lunch complete with birthday cake, children's games and a lengthy bingo session on Monday, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday. `` It's a big deal,'' said <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, of the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> service station. `` The whole community is involved.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON>, near the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was apparently named after the first president, although some have disputed that. Some assert the town was actually named after a dog belonging to one of the founders. `` You should n't believe everything you hear,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, which may be a sad commentary on the birthday of a man who could not tell a lie. But there is no doubt the town has taken much of its identity from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. Many of the streets are named after types of cherries, including <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Montmorency </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>. Businesses have names like the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, the Colonial Market and the Cherry Tree. A highlight of Monday's activities at the community center will be a large birthday cake created by <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. The cake is in the shape of a mountain with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s face on it, said Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, president of the organizing group known as the Georgettes `` The theme is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s head on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>,'' she said. The 18-square foot cake will be enough to feed 1,000 people, Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> actually throws a bigger celebration _ including a parade _ during the Fourth of July, because the weather is better, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, another organizer. At the <LOCATION> Martha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION> restaurant, they'll be serving a noon special of ham and cherry pie for $ 4.25 on Monday, said manager <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppner </PERSON>. The Exxon station will also have a special on pre-packaged cherry pies, selling them two for 89 cents, said Ms. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>. But it will just be business as usual at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not a real big deal that I know of,'' said <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewandowski </PERSON>, a co-owner. `` I'm just going to work.''

 The street party named Carnival delighted parade-goers Sunday but caused trouble for florists delivering Valentine's Day bouquets. `` It hinders delivery and we ca n't make full service,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of a company started by his grandfather. `` We're right on a parade route.'' Three of the 11 parades scheduled Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and its suburbs roll down <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, right past the store. <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON> said his shop would close several hours before the third, a nighttime spectacular put on by the Krewe of <LOCATION> Bacchus </LOCATION>. `` It gets so crowded and hectic that our people would not be able to get home,'' he said. `` We have to think of them.'' Sunday's deliveries were n't as hard as those on Valentine's Day 1973, he said. That day, the sweethearts' holiday coincided with Fat Tuesday. <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON> said a delivery crew of 10 was on the street at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and was finished by 11:30, a half-hour before the first parade rolled in front of his store. However, there were compensations for being on a major parade route. `` We've had tremendous walk-in business,'' <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON> said.

 Sequin - and feather-clad Brazilians turned out in grand style Sunday in the second day of Carnival revelries that featured the first of the top `` samba school'' parades In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, temperatures soared into the high eighties. The skies were sunny, a marked contrast to weeks of almost constant rain that left at least 205 dead and 13,000 homeless. Revelers sunbathed on packed beaches and summoned forces for yet another all-night pre-Lenten blowout. Spirits appeared high, undaunted by the recent tragic flooding, the 16 percent monthly inflation and the country's $ 113 billion foreign debt. Sunday's festivities featured the `` samba schools,'' made up of dancers from neighborhood organizations who compete for dancing prizes. The dancers, mostly from poorer areas, don skimpy rhinestone bikinis and elaborate feather headdresses and often dance for 16 hours at a stretch. Each year the `` schools'' spend millions of dollars on extravagant floats and sumptuous costumes. This year many of the dances, performed before a crowd of 90,000, will poke fun at foreign debt worries, government corruption and poverty and racism in <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>'s version of street-side democracy. The current champion <LOCATION> Mangueira </LOCATION> planned to dance to the theme `` 100 Years Since Slavery: Reality Or Illusion?'' Slavery was abolished 100 years ago but racism still exists in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Padre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miguel </ORGANIZATION> school said it would to poke fun at economic worries and political chaos with the theme `` Kisses, Kisses, Bye Bye <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' The first eight schools were to samba from 8:30 p.m. Sunday until about 10:00 a.m. Monday, with the second group parading during the same hours from Monday to Tuesday. Tickets for the event went for as much as $ 1,000 a piece. Carnival revelers with less to spend were satisfied with the all-night parties in exclusive nightclubs or out under the stars. One of these was the `` <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ball </LOCATION>,'' where men dressed as women frolicked to samba rhythms. Other open-air parties took place along sprawling beach-front <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and through ritzy <LOCATION> Ipanema </LOCATION>, where thumping samba drums beat out rhythms as revelers in sequined costumes, tinsel wigs, masks and outrageous outfits danced the hours away. <PERSON> Veja </PERSON>, the nation's largest circulation newsmagazine, reported that for the first time in recent memory hotels and charter flights were not full. AIDS and crime were blamed. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is second only to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the number of AIDS cases, with an estimated 5,000. As of Jan. 4, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> had received reports of 50,265 Americans with acquired immune deficiency syndrome; 28,149 had died. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> averages 16 murders a day and 2,500 muggings and 1,300 rapes throughout the year. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> government recently threatened to class <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for tourists because of its crime problem. Despite the bad image, police said in the first two days of Carnival festivities there were no festival-related deaths. Health officials have also distributed tens of thousands of pamphlets warning against AIDS in three languages. The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted through sexual contact.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on Sunday turned his fire away from Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and trained it on Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, generally seen as the frontrunner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s primary on Tuesday Television ads that began airing Sunday show <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> describing himself as a candidate with compassion for people and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a bureaucrat. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has accused me of being an old-fashioned Democrat,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says in the commercial. `` I plead guilty. `` It's not enough to have ambition, the fire in the belly to be president. You should also have vision and substance and conviction and the fire in the heart for working men and women and the less fortunate,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to win the primary, with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> fighting it out for second place. `` I think it is increasingly clear that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is now ahead of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator told reporters while campaigning in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. `` It is clear from the momentum, the phone calling we're making in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said polls have always underestimated his strength. `` It was true four years ago when I ran for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Not a single published poll showed me a winner. It was true for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last week.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> finished second, behind <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses last Monday. He needs a strong showing in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary to stay in tne race and to put him in a better position to raise funds for his campaign which is a half million dollars in debt. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said that making <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the focus of his new ads had nothing to do with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s criticism of his television campaign against the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman. In the earlier advertising blitz, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had accused <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of coming up with campaign themes that ran counter to his voting record. After the news conference, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaigned in the streets and one of his stops was the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign headquarters, where he greeted workers. He also made a stop at a florist's to buy Valentine's Day roses for his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, who was accompanying him. Earlier, at the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION>, he telephoned <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Keis-Kuna </PERSON>, a Soviet refusenik who has been on a hunger strike for 12 days in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. `` I just want to wish you the very best,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Keis-Kuna </PERSON>, who has been trying to get visas to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for herself, her husband and her son. `` We are grateful to you for your courage.''

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retained strong support in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but the perception he could win the Republican presidential nomination has plummeted since the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, according to poll results published in the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The poll's aim was to gauge changing voter sentiments following the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. On the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> side, the newspaper reported that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> surged to the front of the Democratic pack but pollsters warned the Democratic race in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> remained volatile. Of the 244 Republican voters who said they would probably vote in the March 8 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> primary, 51 percent said they felt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the best chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination. In October's poll, 72 percent of likely voters said they believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the best chance. In October, 8 percent of likely voters said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the most likely Republican nominee. That figure rose to 28 percent in the most recent poll. Of the 304 Democrats who said they were likely to vote March 8, 27 percent said they would vote for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> if the vote were now, compared to 8 percent in October. The poll, also conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, was from surveys done Wednesday and Thursday. For the poll, interviewers contacted 690 of 1,017 registered <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters first questioned in October.

 <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential primary has become a tight two-man race between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, while the Democratic contest is a three-way virtual dead heat, according to a poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, who was far behind in a January survey of Marylanders, has surged into contention after his victory Monday in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. He now holds a slim lead over <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The Sun Poll published in Sunday's editions gave <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a lead of only 2 percentage points _ 22 percent to 20 percent over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was supported by 19 percent of those in The Sun's sample The three Democrats fell within the margin of sampling error for the poll, meaning none was the clear leader. The margin is plus or minus 3.6 percent. `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> solidified my conviction that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has viability,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a 61-year-old insurance broker from <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said he liked <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s honesty and his call for open markets overseas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, but he admitted to a deep skepticism about all the candidates, including his favorite. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 39 percent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 37 percent among the 753 registered Republicans surveyed, within the poll's margin of error. The leaders are neck and neck in the Republican race, but they are far ahead of the other contenders, including <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who ran second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was favored by 7 percent of those responding to the Sun Poll.

<HEAD>Gephardt Says Claims He Supported Reaganomics `Balderdash'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on Sunday dismissed as `` balderdash'' rivals' charges he was a supporter of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax and economics program. Two days before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressmen paused for a Valentine's Day lobster-and-chowder lunch with his wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> at a bayside seafood house, then greeted hundreds of shoppers at a nearby mall. But as he met lunchtime diners he was confronted by one man's question about his changes of position, and he defended himself anew against similar charges as he spoke to reporters <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s charged in the Democrats' televised debate Saturday night that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had changed positions to suit the electorate he next faced _ talking against `` Reaganomics'' in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and in favor of it in this traditionally anti-tax state. `` That's just balderdash,'' he said. `` I have been the leader against Reaganomics in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> defended his vote for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1981 tax-cut bill as cast only after the Democrats' alternative was defeated _ and saying he differed with his rivals on the need for lowering taxes on middle-income people. `` Once we lost, the question was clear _ were we for a tax cut for the middle class, or were we not,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` When we get to the South and the general election, we ca n't be the party of higher taxes on the middle class,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> focused mainly on taxes and lashed back at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, saying: `` Senator <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s record is clear _ he's resisted every measure to reduce the taxes on individual <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families that's come along. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who edged <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, is locked in what could be a political death-struggle with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for second place behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Tuesday primary. Heavily in debt, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign badly needs to finish no lower than second. He has been under attack from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s television commercials and from the public comments of most of his rivals _ who say <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has flip-flopped on issues. Speaking to reporters, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> maintained anew that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s aids and rhetoric `` falsely accused me. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s lonely vote against the 1986 tax overhaul bill reflected `` total ignorance of what the bill was about.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also sought to lump <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on taxes, saying, `` He does n't want to tell you what he's for on taxes.'' As he worked his way through the 300 or so people at <LOCATION> Newick </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lobster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overlooking <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ran into a questioner who wanted to know why he had changed his position to oppose the MX missile `` I watched the debate last night _ I thought they'd kind of nailed him on that,'' said the man, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Overall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who said he came to visit friends in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> this week to watch the presidential campaigners. Overall said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> stopped and told him he'd changed positions in an effort to reach a bipartisan position in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would be supportive of arms control negotiations. `` I accept that,'' Overall said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s appearance did n't create much of a stir, except for the disorder caused by the news media crush, at the restaurant. It is a traditional stop for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential campaigners. `` It's a little slow _ we're ususally full for lunch,'' said waitress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miltner </PERSON>. `` We're not making any money either.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> election officials are hoping, for strictly nonpartisan reasons, that some of the 12 remaining presidential candidates will drop out before the state's June primary Many voting machines have room for only eight candidates on a line, and as of Sunday, five Republicans and seven Democrats were seeking their parties' presidential nomination. Things looked up on Friday, when former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race. And other candidates may drop out after Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary or after March 8, when voters will choose candidates in 20 states in the South and elsewhere. However, with the Garden State primary scheduled for June 7, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> clerks ca n't afford to sit around and wait,'' said <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>. When one machine is used at a polling site, a lever is used to set it for one party or the other, depending on the voter's registration But many county clerks have already arranged to rent machines from other states to give each party its own machine. In addition to the presidential candidates, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> officials must find space on their ballots for candidates in congressional primaries, the Democratic nomination for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat and candidates for delegates to the two major parties' national conventions. Fewer presidential candidates would make life easier for elections officials, but <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said she's not so sure that the slate will get smaller. `` It's so easy for them to get matching federal funds today that they're just not as encouraged to drop out,'' she said. `` We've been through this problem since 1976, and it's getting worse every four years,'' said <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>. Many other states do not have to worry about overcrowded ballots because their local and state elections are held later in the year or even in non-presidential years. `` That really eases the pressure on our ballot,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, ballots were crowded in 1984 with long lists of delegates for the Democratic National Convention. This year, voters will vote directly for presidential candidates, and the number of delegates will be allocated in proportion to the popular vote. `` We have only 10 columns on our machines,'' Ms. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said. `` There's no way I could make up a ballot for both parties to go into one machine.'' Even <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which has new computerized voting machines, may be forced to look as far as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to rent additional equipment. `` Ordinarily, we can play with our ballot across the whole spectrum, while other machines are usually confined by rows or columns,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. `` But we have burned the midnight oil trying to compose the current ballot in a way that fits.'' Additional voting machines may cost as much as $ 700 each in rental, transportation and storage fees, she said. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said he warned the secretary of state's office last summer about the voting machine problem. It will cost <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> $ 378,000 to rent extra voting machines, he estimated, `` and I would have extra costs involved _ more tabulating, more paper, more sample ballots.'' Clerks in several <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> counties are not worried about the upcoming primary, however, because they use voting machines that take computer cards. `` Each voter gets a ballot card that they slide into the machine,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Clerk <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> `` Honey'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>. `` They use a stylus in the confines of the voting booth to punch out various numbers that denote the candidates.'' The director of the state election division, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, has warned county clerks to make preliminary arrangements to rent extra machines. But after Tuesday's primary and the many `` Super Tuesday'' contests held March 8, `` I think you'll see some candidates drop out,'' she said. `` There's usually a lot of nervousness among county clerks at this point. It will phase out.''

 Military police detained two soldiers Sunday after allegations that troops using a bulldozer buried alive four Arabs after an anti-Israeli protest earlier this month, the army said. Further detentions are expected in the case, said an army official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the detainees are being questioned, but that no charges have been filed. He declined to give further details. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, army officials said three Arabs were injured when a firebomb they were preparing exploded. They refused to provide further details. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents reported hearing a loud explosion at about 7 p.m. It was the second such incident in two days. On Saturday, two <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residents were injured while preparing a homemade bomb. In the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, hundreds of Druse pelted police with stones and sang patriotic songs to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annexation of the area six years ago. Some demonstrators chanted `` with blood and fire we will liberate the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION>.'' Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. The report said more than two dozen Druse were arrested, 32 injured by rubber bullets and scores overcome by tear gas. Five police officers were hurt after being struck by stones and several others also were overcome by the gas, the report said. Elsewhere, scattered Palestinian protests were reported Sunday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, territories captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, assailants torched an Israeli bus, and in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> nine cars were set ablaze. The two soldiers were detained after news reports said troops used a a bulldozer to bury alive four Arabs Feb. 5 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> after violent anti-Israeli protests there. An army official confirmed that soldiers `` misbehaved'' during an incident at the village, but refused further comment until the investigation is completed. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reporter who visited <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> on Sunday quoted residents as saying about 20 soldiers grabbed four men in their early 20s, ordered them to remove roadblocks, then beat them and forced them to lie on the ground. A bulldozer pulled up and covered the men with dirt, said the reporter of the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted villagers as saying the men were unconscious when they were dug out. The Yediot reporter said three of the men were treated and released from a <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> hospital while the fourth was hospitalized for eight days. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted one of the men, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtiya </PERSON>, as saying his shoes remained buried in the dirt. The army said it was checking reports of a similar incident near the Shati refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But a spokesman said he had no further details Sunday. The army said a woman from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of Arrub who died during anti-Israeli protests Feb. 6 was killed by bullets fired from a Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifle. The army said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers do n't carry such weapons. Hundreds of Druse youths, demonstrating to mark the sixth anniversary of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annexation of the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, threw stones at police in the village of <PERSON> Majdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shams </PERSON>. About 1,000 riot police were deployed in Druse villages to quell the protests. Army radio said several youths were hurt after police moved in despite pleas from local leaders for security forces to stay clear. `` People started to sing nationalistic songs and to show identification with our country, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and against the occupation,'' <PERSON> Kansh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sallah </PERSON>, a village leader, told the radio. `` Then the police began to interfere, so it started to roll until it led to tear gas.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> during the 1967 war and officially annexed the territory on Feb. 14, 1982. The Druse, members of a mystical sect that is an offshoot of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, have marked each anniversary with demonstrations. A general strike continued Sunday throughout the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where an Israeli civilian bus was burned by Palestinian youths. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said nine cars were set ablaze in the Jewish <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood of the city. In the <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 60 rock-hurling Arabs staged demonstrations. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, 54 Arabs have died in the disturbances that began Dec. 8.

 Black activist <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who waged a 28-year battle to practice law in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and helped break the color barrier at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, died after a lengthy illness. He was 81. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> had been in poor health for several months. He died Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Munroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> after suffering acute kidney failure, his wife, <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>, said Saturday. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Okahumpka </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, taught school and was a principal in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools in the 1940s after graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Bethune-Cookman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. In 1949, at the age of 41, he applied for admission to the all-white law school at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> and was rejected because he was black. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> challenged the state's segregated school system and in 1956 the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that he should be admitted to the school. But the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> invoked states' rights to deny him admission and the state's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> then adopted rigid entrance requirements that made it impossible for <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> to enroll even if he won court approval. In 1976 the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> urged the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to allow <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> to take the state bar examination even though he had attended an unaccredited law school in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> 20 years earlier. The Bar said he should be given special consideration because of his ill treatment while trying to enter law school in 1949. In November 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 7-0 that <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> should be allowed to practice law and waived a requirement that he first take the bar exam. After a 28-year fight, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> opened his law practice in a tiny office off Main Street in downtown <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>. But at the age of 77 he found himself before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> again in November 1983 because of complaints about his legal competence and allegations that he misappropriated $ 15,000 entrusted to him by a client. In January 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> censured <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and placed him on probation for two years because of errors he made in his first cases. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, facing two additional complaints, was allowed to resign from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> in April 1985.

 Three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members were killed Sunday when a bomb ripped through the car they were driving to lunch, authorities said. The wife of one of the three men saw the blast as she stood on a nearby balcony, cradling a baby, said state-run <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> radio. Police in this southern port city said the bomb went off around noon, killing the three instantly and destroying the automobile. The official <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said it received an anonymous phone call from a man who said the killing was carried out by the Group of Martyrs of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rassem </PERSON> el-Ghoul. Officials said they had never heard of the group. The caller, speaking in broken English, accused the slain Palestinians of having been involved in the fatal shooting of el-Ghoul, a top commando in Force 17. Force 17 is the elite security apparatus of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s guerrilla faction. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials had said the three killed in the blast were officers in Fatah. There was no immediate <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> comment on the claim of responsibility. El-Ghoul, the Force 17 area commander in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was kidnapped in August last year. His body was found two days later, but the motive for the slaying was never established. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer who visited the scene of the blast said the car's roof was blown off, the vehicle was wrecked and two of the bodies were blown 60 feet from the car. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of being behind the slayings. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> linked the deaths to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attempts to stop a ship filled with 133 Palestinian deportees from sailing from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> started this open war after losing the secret war concerning the ship,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of waging a `` secret war'' to prevent the voyage. It now says the vessel will sail on Monday. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. In a later news conference, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> backed off from his earlier claim that the attack was linked to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> frustration over failing to stop the boat. But he called it `` clear proof'' that the Israelis `` continue their terrorism not only against our population in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, but also elsewhere.'' He was referring to more than two months of violence that has rocked the Israeli-occupied territories. The director of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazale </PERSON>, identified the victims as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>; <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayyali </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kayyali </PERSON> was also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military council. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> was in his early 40s, the other two in their late 20s. <PERSON> Ghazale </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> had Lebanese nationality, <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON> traveled under another name with a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemeni </LOCATION> passport and <LOCATION> Kayyali </LOCATION> had a Moroccan passport. He did not have details of the men's precise functions in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Police said they did not believe that the blast was not connected with presidential elections being held in the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> sector of this Mediterranean island on Sunday. Police said the explosion did not disrupt the voting in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, the island's second largest city with a population of 121,000. <PERSON> Ghazale </PERSON> said the three were on their way to lunch when the bomb exploded. Eyewitnesses gave a similar account. That differed from the original police account, which said the car apparently was parked at the time of the blast. The discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled. A sizable number of Arabs, mainly Lebanese and Palestinians, live in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla factions who are the Palestinians' military arm. The main group is <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, which has an estimated 8,000 guerrillas, most of them in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 Socialist Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said Sunday he would consider resigning if the controversy over President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s World War II conduct continues to hamper <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>'s leadership. About 5,000 people, including actor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandauer </PERSON>, gathered in central <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> outside the landmark St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s Cathedral to call for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s ouster About half of them marched to the <ORGANIZATION> Hofburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, which accommodates the president's office, and chanted, `` <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> must go!'' In an hour-long television interview, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, who heads a coalition government, launched a sharp attack on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, whose duties as head of state are mostly ceremonial. The president `` did not deal exactly with the truth'' during the investigation into his activities as a soldier in the Nazi army, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said. He stopped short, however, of urging <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to step down. Veteran political observers did not recall a similar public confrontation between a chancellor and a president since the second Austrian republic was established after World War II. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> government appointed a historians' commission to investigate <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime record last year after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government put the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary general on a `` watchlist'' of undesirable aliens. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was a lieutenant in a German unit that sent thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps. The historians released their report Monday. The 202-page document established <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s `` close proximity'' to wartime atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> and seriously questioned his integrity as a German army officer. The tabloid Kurier published on Sunday an interview in which <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said he has no plans to resign because he enjoys the support of a `` great'' and `` silent'' majority. `` I feel the group who makes the demand that I should resign is relatively small compared to those who want me to stay in office,'' the president was quoted as saying. In a comment published in early Monday editions of the Kurier, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was quoted as saying he continues to be `` interested in a constructive relationship with the federal chancellor.'' But <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, when asked how <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> could emerge from a situation in which the country faces a bad image abroad and division at home, said: `` We must try to get out of this situation by not satisfying ourselves with allowing the president not to face up to these things.'' <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said it was not enough for the president to give newspaper interviews because `` interviews do n't replace the question-and-answer game in a democracy.'' He warned that if his expectations about the president's conduct are not fulfilled and if a high percentage of his time continues to be absorbed by the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> affair, `` then the question arises if I can ... carry on this -LRB- government post -RRB-.'' The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which backed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> when he won his six-year term in 1986. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, a chief <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> secretary, reported Saturday that for the first time a majority of party members now want <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to resign. Also on Saturday, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> told Austrian radio that mere non-involvement in war crimes did not qualify one to be <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s president <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> continued his criticism Sunday by seriously questioning <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s ability to perform his duties. `` The federal president must be an integration figure, not a disintegration figure,'' he said. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and his advisers for trying to portray the attacks on the president as something orchestrated by Jews and foreigners. On Friday, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> stirred outrage by claiming that members of the commission were <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s enemies because they were either socialists or Jews. Meanwhile, the Swiss military historian who led the historians' commission said Sunday he sensed that the Austrian president felt a `` certain moral culpability'' for war crimes committed while he served in the German army <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON>, in an interview on Swiss radio, said he asked <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> why two biographies do not mention his wartime past. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> replied, `` I did much more important things,'' <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. `` But the better response would have been: ` I was hesitant to talk about it.','' he said in the French-language interview. `` I am not saying he is guilty of war crimes. But he feels a certain moral culpability. It disturbs him.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Sunday said he was convinced that Republican presidential rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` has a secret plan to raise taxes,'' using a blue-ribbon study commission as the vehicle. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said it was n't true. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, whose third place showing in polls has been threatened by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, insisted he will beat the former TV evangelist in Tuesday's primary because `` the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> want a conservative who can reach out beyond just one segment of the population and win. `` Electability is going to be an issue,'' he said. With the campaign heating up over the weekend, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> raised the tax issue that is dear to the hearts of Granite State voters who often hear candidates take a no-increase pledge. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said having a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission recommend how to balance the budget was first suggested by Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but the idea went nowhere until <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader _ `` slipped it into'' recent legislation. `` I am convinced that Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a secret plan to raise taxes on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` That would totally frustrate the Republican message that we are the low-tax party.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` is going to allow the commission to do a study, endorse it, and say, ` Hey, this is not my tax increase. This is the commission's tax increase.' That's what he did on the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said he does n't want `` our six -LRB- Republican members of the commission -RRB- going in there with any thought of raising taxes ... `` We just had tax reform. We took a lot of things away from a lot of people. My view is we ought to give the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people a rest from increased taxes.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he already has chosen one commission member, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>. Asked why he waited until two days before <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s primary to raise the issue, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the campaign is only now turning to issues Speaking at a school later, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he would ask former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> to be his secretary of state if he is elected president.

<BYLINE>Seventeen Killed Clashes Between Troops and Rebels In Sri Lanka

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Indian troops killed 12 Tamil rebels in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Sunday, residents said. Military officials said the unconfirmed report came hours after five soldiers died when a land mine exploded. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the blast occurred in eastern <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> district, where Indian troops have conducted search operations since Thursday. <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> residents, contacted by telephone, said the slayings of Tamils were `` in reprisal'' for the land mine explosion. The residents, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said they heard two blasts near <LOCATION> Eravur </LOCATION> village, nine miles north of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, followed by gunfire. A spokeswoman at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, said she had no reports of any casualties in the area, about 140 miles northeast of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. More than 15,000 of the 42,000 Indian soldiers in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> are involved in operations against the Tamil insurgents in <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> district. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where 60 million Tamils live, sent troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> under a peace accord aimed at ending the four-year guerrilla war waged by Tamil rebels for a separate homeland. The rebels briefly accepted the July 29 accord but broke the truce last fall. More than 370 Indian soldiers and 1,100 rebels have been killed in fighting since then. The mainly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the army.

<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cereal factory worker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> says he's suffered years of gossip, malicious pranks and the cold shoulder because of a local newspaper's report of what turned out to be a unjustified arrest. He sued the police departments that took him into custody and settled out of court for $ 4,000 plus attorney fees. But he also contends the <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Enquirer should pay. <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> is seeking $ 1 million in a suit that has triggered a major upheaval in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> libel law. He presented his side of the case to a jury last week and the newspaper gives its side this week. The case has given <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> a new standard for determining when private citizens can sue over news reports on items of public interest, because the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided that <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON>'s case should be heard by a jury. The court ruled that the fact that the newspaper did n't print false information knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth was not enough to clear it of liability. The state's highest court said the right to report on official proceedings does n't extend to arrests that fail to result in formal charges, and that the decision of whether damages are owed should be based on evidence of negligence, rather than malice, which is more difficult to prove. The Enquirer is refraining from out-of-court comment on the case. But a year ago, after the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> acted, newspaper attorney <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> suggested all <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> newspapers could have a more difficult time monitoring police activities. `` The power of arrest is the most serious power the government has over us,'' she said. `` If we are not able to cover that, it raises all kinds of ugly specters about what the police can do without it appearing in the newspapers.'' <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jereck </PERSON>, rejects that reasoning. He maintains that the newspaper could have reported on the attack of a sleeping baby sitter without printing the name of the man taken into custody. He also faults the newspaper for failing to follow up and write about the dropping of preliminary charges against <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> and the arrest of a second suspect. The charges cited at the time of his arrest were never brought formally because the case was dropped before <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> was arraigned. `` They do n't practice what they preach,'' <PERSON> Jereck </PERSON> said. `` Is n't the public interested in knowing when the police make a bad arrest That was n't reported.'' Because of the appeals and high court deliberations, more than eight years have passed since the newspaper published what seemed to be a routine, six-paragraph account of the arrest of a man suspected of raping a teen-ager who was caring for his ex-wife's children <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> was booked, fingerprinted, read his rights. He got out of jail on a personal recognizance bond and was told when to show up for arraignment. But the prosecutor's office opted not to press charges, and because his name was in the newspaper, <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> contends he's been branded a rapist. Now the jury must determine whether the newspaper story was false and whether it was published without reasonable care. <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON>'s attorney tried to convince the jury that the story falsely accused him of raping a 17-year-old baby sitter. The newspaper, in presenting its side, will try to convince the jury that the 1979 article did n't accuse <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> of committing a crime, but merely reported accurately an arrest as reported by police. Witnesses testifying in <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON>'s behalf said they had presumed him guilty because they saw his name in print. One woman told the jury she refused to let her daughter join friends at the <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> home. `` I connected him with the rape of a teen-age girl,'' <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> testified. A former classmate testified he was startled to see <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> walking the streets and said he had assumed he was behind bars. That classmate never saw the story, printed nearly a year after the arrest, saying <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> had been cleared and another man arrested in the case. That article was published after a <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON>'s attorney threatened legal action. `` They thought I was a rapist,'' <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> testified, adding that he lost sleep and became more reclusive. `` I more or less just stayed home,'' he testified. `` I thought it was best for the children. I drank more for a while than I normally did.'' A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollenhoff </PERSON>, criticized the newsgathering practices of the newspaper's police beat reporter. He said the newspaper should have waited two or three days before printing the story. The newspaper will have its own expert witnesses this week: <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> journalism school dean <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>.

I would never go for him, but it made me feel good that I was matched up with interesting kinds of people,'' she said. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Synovic </PERSON>, senior class president at <ORGANIZATION> Zion-Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said she did n't know her top match and was not particularly interested once she found out more about him. `` But it was a good topic of conversation,'' she said, `` Like, ` You're on my list _ oh, wow, we must have something in common.''' <PERSON> Pryz </PERSON> and her partner, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, started Computer Daze five years ago as a way for schools to raise money. They charge 60 cents per list. Schools charge students about $ 2 for the rankings and keep the profit, <PERSON> Pryz </PERSON> said. The forms students fill out include questions like: What is the worst thing a teacher can do? What would you do if you found $ 100? What absolutely turns you off? And how do you feel when a teacher criticizes you in class? The questions have no double meaning, <PERSON> Pryz </PERSON> said. `` Some kids have asked us to put in ` What will and wo n't you do on the first date? First base? Second base?' But we wo n't do that.'' <PERSON> Pryz </PERSON> said computer dating has none of the stigma in high schools that it sometimes has with adults. `` The kids scream and shriek when they open the letters,'' said <PERSON> Pryz </PERSON>. She offers the service on a nationwide basis, too, she said. `` It's a big thing for a few weeks,'' said <PERSON> Synovic </PERSON>, who has participated in the computer matching program for the last four years. `` We joke about it,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a junior at <LOCATION> Zion-Benton </LOCATION>. `` I never do anything with my list. I do n't even know my No. 1 girl, but the whole thing does give you something to talk about during lunch.''

 What happens in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> may decide who among the Democratic presidential candidates get to go South with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is looking forward to the first Republican contest in the South no matter what happens Tuesday. Analysts say that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> pushed up between front-runners <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will be on his friendliest turf when the presidential season moves into its Southern phase. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, polls put him in a dead heat for third place with Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>. Contests are scheduled in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and a handful of other states in the three weeks after Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary. The next main event is the Super Tuesday primary across most of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and in several other states on March 8, but the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary three days before that could emerge as a crucial GOP test. `` There's tremendous potential for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to be a spoiler here,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's putting a lot of money and organizational effort into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. He's thrown down the gauntlet, and I think he's in position to back that up.'' On the Democratic side, the presidential race in the South will be shaped by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s results. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> winner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> hopes that a second-place finish behind local favorite <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, will propel the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman into a strong position to face the South's native son, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. A <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> finish behind Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, could leave the field still muddled as it turns South _ a page right out of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s script. Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> have been polling at the bottom of the Democratic pack in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and are hoping Tuesday for surprising finishes to keep their faltering campaigns alive long enough for Super Tuesday. Already, there are signs of bad blood between the rival campaigns of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who is competing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> but has reserved most of his money for the Southern campaign. Both Democrats have designs on the white, moderate-to-conservative Democratic vote in the South. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign manager <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> used harsh language to the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last week about <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. He said: `` I ca n't wait It's blood lust. Let me at him. I hate him. I hate all of them.'' The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign said Sunday that <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> `` formally apologized today ... for profane, personal attacks and comments critical of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign.'' The apologies were made to both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> himself and campaign manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON>, press secretary for the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign. `` Both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> accepted the apology and agreed with <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> that the matter was over,'' <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the campaign remains convinced the influence of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> will be diminished this year by <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s chosen battleground, the South. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Republicans, dominated by loyalists to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, set up their primary on Saturday March 5 in hopes it would give the vice president a boost in case he needed it before the Super Tuesday primaries in the rest of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. But now <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former TV evangelist who lives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, has targeted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as his next best chance and predicted he will win it outright. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s strong <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> second-place finish behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, handing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a humiliating third place, was explained in part by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s strong organization among fundamentalist and charismatic Christian voters and the traditionally low turnout of caucus contests. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> he has a primary rather than a caucus, but one with a history of low turnout and a Bible-belt location favorable to his message. `` Using those evangelical churches and his high-tech methods to get his people out, and rolling the church buses on Saturday, he can find a lot of voters,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Elsewhere in the South, Republicans say <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> may demonstrate a strength not detected in the polls. `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will probably come in second in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ if he does n't come in first,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP state chairman. `` This is the Bible Belt,'' he said. `` I think really there is something happening.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is credited with a Southern organization far superior to that of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and polls show him far and away the Southern leader. But a loss in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> could leave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> struggling to hang on to both his organization and his poll lead. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to look ahead,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, political analyst at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has crafted what may be a Maginot Line: ` If we do badly in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, we've got <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> If we do badly there, we've got <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> ...' If <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> takes away a victory from him in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, that's it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s southern co-ordinator <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, however, insists that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can remain strong in the South even with another setback. `` Frankly, we do n't have any bad states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. `` We lead in every state. We lead in every demographic group, among conservatives and independents. There is no region -LRB- of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> -RRB- or demographic group where we do n't lead.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is at an organizational disadvantage in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> but has had his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, working the region for him. Her home state is considered a key strength for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the South. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s Southern spokesman, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, claimed `` a groundswell of support'' following <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` You have to take into account we have n't done any paid media -LRB- ads -RRB- yet in the South,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Soviets Visiting Utah In Preparation For INF Verification Team</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet technicians will visit <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> this week to review living arrangements for inspectors who will be stationed here to verify compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, an official said. At the same time, a three-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contingent will travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to conduct a similar tour, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said Saturday. The visit of the Soviet technicians is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near the Hercules Bacchus West plant in western <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> under terms of the INF pact, which bans production of intermediate-range missiles. The treaty was signed in December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but still faces ratification by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet inspectors will monitor the Hercules plant, which developed motors for <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles now banned under the treaty. The American team will be stationed in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION> where SS-20 nuclear weapons were made, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, about 600 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, has been closed to foreign visitors. The two countries' advance teams will meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a week after the tours to discuss housing, travel restrictions and other arrangements for the inspectors, said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. The inspection teams could be settled in each nation within 60 days of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the treaty. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials will accompany the Soviet technicians on a tour of the area within 31 miles of the Hercules plant. Soviet inspectors later could be allowed to travel within that zone. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said this week's tours are the first of many such meetings planned before the inspection teams arrive. The treaty spells out few details of living arrangements, leaving them to the two host countries. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who has said he believes `` virtually all'' of the Soviet inspectors in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> will be spies, has asked for a secret study of security precautions for as many as 63 government contractors located within a 31-mile radius of the Hercules plant. The senator also has called for restrictions on the inspectors to reduce the possibility of espionage. Any limitations imposed would be reciprocal, he said.

 Nine women competed for the title of Miss Garlic, but a 73-year-old woman who said she downs the stuff morning, noon and night walked off with the crown. `` I do n't think I'd be able to live without garlic,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Knarr </PERSON>, who was named Miss Garlic at a weekend festival dedicated to the lily family's most aromatic relative. `` I have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' she said. The judges compared notes Saturday on the contestants while the festival's first Miss Garlic, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, sang `` Me And My Garlic'' to the tune of `` Me And My Shadow.'' After an accordion fanfare, Mrs. <PERSON> Knarr </PERSON> was named the winner and received the crown and sash from <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorrasi </PERSON>, the defending queen who said she sat out this year's pageant because because some of her family members sniffed at the title. `` My children said I was a source of embarrassment to them,'' she said. An estimated 400 people attended the fourth annual event, which left a distinct odor wafting throughout a restaurant in <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The participants lined up for garlic-peeling contests, wore headbands made of garlic cloves, and downed dishes spiced with 160 pounds of garlic imported from <LOCATION> Gilroy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which calls itself `` The Garlic Capital of the World.'' `` What do I like most about it? I like the flavor a lot,'' said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> of <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>, who won the cooking competition with her version of garlic-stuffed mushrooms. Her recipe is heavy on the garlic, light on the mushrooms. `` I make them a lot. I take them to people's houses,'' she said. `` They either eat them or they do n't eat them _ I eat them then.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called Sunday for a 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons and a ban on nuclear warhead testing and weapons in space, coupled with a strengthening of the nation's conventional forces. `` If the next president is required to use force, it will almost certainly be conventional forces and not nuclear,'' he said. The Democratic presidential hopeful, in what was billed as a major foreign policy speech, said `` the next president is n't going to be giving blank checks to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> or to anybody else. If he did, the checks would bounce.'' `` But we can have the forces we need at a price we can afford if we are willing to make some tough choices and if we invest our limited resources wisely,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would seek `` to get a dollar's worth of security for every dollar we spend.'' In the speech, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he would not hesitate to use military force to defend vital interests. `` There is no room in this hemisphere for military bases from which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or any other power for that matter might project military force against ourselves, our allies or our friends,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or any other government in Central or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> seeks to overthrow or subvert its neighbors, we have the right and the responsibility to stop them.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his opposition to aid to Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. And he pledged to abide by the War Powers Act, which places limits on presidential use of military force. He also said he would observe the treaty of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the rulings of the World Court. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has violated all three, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of bumbling and incompetence in addition to violation of international law. `` There's nothing strong about wandering around the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> without a minesweeper,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, a reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to send a minesweeping vessel to that region when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first ordered escorts of oil tankers `` There's nothing strong about selling arms to terrorists,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said that as president he would never make concessions to terrorists although he said he would talk to them, if the situation warranted. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that in his administration, `` Authority in the executive branch will come, not from an admiral or a lieutenant colonel, but from the commander in chief.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> avoided comment on a new commercial by rival <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, which cites a recent editorial in the Lawrence -LRB- Mass. -RRB- Eagle-Tribune. The editorial says if elected, the governor would lead a bureaucracy, not the people. Questioned outside the <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, Knights of <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had not seen the advertisement. `` I'm not watching much television,'' he said.

 Front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> became the focus of attacks from his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals Sunday as the Republican hopefuls traded barbs in one last debate in the increasingly bitter campaign for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. Less than 48 hours before the first votes will be cast in the first primary, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> called for the gradual abolition of Social Security. Opponent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the former television evangelist has `` some off-the-wall ideas.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, running neck-and-neck for Tuesday's primary, tossed charges back and forth in the hour-long League of Women Voters debate on Sunday night `` You were for it before you read it. I waited to read it first. That's the difference,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said about the new arms control treaty with the Soviets. `` I was for it when the president proposed it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted. Later in the debate, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> blew up at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when the vice president used the 1960s phrase, `` Give peace a chance.'' `` You should be embarrassed to use ` Give peace a chance','' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We're the party of peace through strength.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also went after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I am convinced that Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a secret plan to raise taxes on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, before the debate. `` That would totally frustrate the Republican message that we are the low-tax party.'' On the Democratic side, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> switched to attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the clear front-runner in the Democratic field. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> dropped his controversial focus on <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, with whom he is battling for the No. 2 spot. `` I think it is increasingly clear that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is now ahead of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> news conference. `` There is a difference, and a clear alternative to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is emphasizing a new ad aimed at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor: `` In endorsing <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for president, the <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagle-Tribune </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> said ` President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would head a bureaucracy. President <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would head a nation of people,''' the ad said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> denied that the ad change had anything to do with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s harsh criticism of the commercials. For his part, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has a television ad calling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` one of the biggest tax raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history.'' The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman rejected suggestions he embraced Reaganomics in 1981 as `` balderdash,'' saying the question was `` were we for the tax cut for the middle class or we were not?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejected the suggestion in <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s ad. `` We did n't have dozens and dozens of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- up here working their heads off and dozens and dozens of firefighters working their heads off for me yesterday because they do n't think I'm for working men and women,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. Early in the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the differences among the Republicans were not what they seem. `` We're going to be together after this ... So it does n't have the deep decisions that you might think from the agony of the moment or the ad of the moment or from the charge and countercharge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But he and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> continued their charges about leadership outside the debate format. `` I do n't think he has made any decisions in the last seven years,'' the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a CBS News interview broadcast Sunday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he is pleased with his progress in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once had a big lead: `` I have come a long way in the last 30 days.'' For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his campaign's ads that say <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has `` straddled'' making decisions on several major issues. `` The man is running on leadership,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>. `` I think it is fair to look at the results.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who ran second in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, still grabbed the attention as he said he might do even better in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the television anchormen's faces when they have to report that <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' the former television evangelist told a congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> ushers ordered reporters not to take tape recorders or pens and paper into the service, checking them at the door to enfoce the rule. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> gave a political speech in which he talked of how his life had been guided by <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s messages, including his race for the White House. Asked if he might best <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'': `` Would n't that be a wonderful thing for the country? <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said `` there is n't going to be any money'' available in Social Security in the next century when younger people retire. Thus, he wants to gradually abolish the system, while paying current benefits, `` over 40 years, moving it into a private system.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who is battling <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> for conservative hearts, minds and votes, lashed out at the former preacher. `` He has said some off-the-wall things about the economy, about foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet The Press.'' Asked for specifics, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has said, `` Credit cards are the mark of the beast and that we are going to hell in a hand basket because of the deficit.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would not do as well in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> as in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` He broke a lot of china in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and he's working very hard in the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Who knows?'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` I think it is a lot more difficult for him in a state like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> both distributed literature at churches, a tactic <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> used successfuly last Sunday in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> workers were in the church parking lots passing out brochures headlined, `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> _ The candidate for believers,'' while <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> forces once again handed out a `` Biblical Scoreboard.'' Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he would not end his born-again <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign if he does not do well in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the state that gave him a miracle victory in 1984. `` Of course not,'' was his reply to the question on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> program. And <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he is not just on an ego trip by continuing his campaign: `` I'm not a dog in the manger. I'm not a spoiler.'' New polls by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> knotted at about 30 percent among Republicans. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and du Pont were tied at about 10 percent.

 Lawyers for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Sunday the Panamian strongman has `` dynamite'' information that could influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election, and they threatened to use the files `` if we have to.'' `` We were given access by General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to files which contain political dynamite _ files which could affect the upcoming presidential election in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the positions of other nations,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said after arriving at Miami International Airport. He refused to elaborate. `` Right now, we're just going to sit tight with them -LRB- the files -RRB-. If we have to use them, we'll use them,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, another defense lawyer, later in response to a question. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> added, `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told us that he has always been a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is still a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on drug trafficking charges by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> earlier this month. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> and fellow lawyers <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollin </PERSON> conferred with their client, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, Friday. <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, the former chief of the criminal division in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, and <PERSON> Kollin </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Saturday. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> returned Sunday.

 Ninety-four Chinese couples tied the knot in two mass weddings Sunday. Organizers said that while it was considered a lucky day to marry, it was only coincidental the ceremonies landed on Valentine's Day. `` This kind of wedding has special meaning. It is memorable because it is bigger and more exciting,'' said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongling </PERSON>, one of 44 brides at the afternoon ceremony. The Great Wall Sheraton Hotel organized the two ceremonies, which fall three days before Spring Festival, or Lunar New Year. Spring Festival is considered an auspicious time for marriage, and Chinese traditionally schedule weddings on even-numbered days, which are said to be lucky. Valentine's Day is not celebrated in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the master of ceremonies mentioned the Western holiday and explained its origin and significance to the newylweds. The hotel's elegant ballroom was decorated with colored streamers and two large red hearts for the ceremonies. One bride wore a white wedding gown, but all the others were in red, the Chinese color for weddings. A few wore traditional Chinese cheongsams, a close-fitting dress. While friends and family threw colored confetti, the couples bowed three times, once to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Vice-Mayor He <PERSON> Luli </PERSON>, once to their parents and once to each other. Mass weddings have been encouraged by the government, which has been alarmed at the increasingly lavish weddings and receptions that couples are throwing. According to Chinese reports, young urban couples in some areas spend about $ 2,000 on their weddings, the equivalent of three years' income. By comparison, the hotel charged about $ 27 per couple and $ 4 per guest. For that amount, the hotel provided a simple cake for each couple, snacks and soft drinks and entertainment. Some parents prefer the traditional wedding feast, but Ms. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said, `` My family is ` 80s-minded.''

 A hazardous gas leaked Sunday for the third time since late January from an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> mill that has continued operating during a strike, and seven people were taken to hospitals, officials said. IP officials said no one was exposed outside the mill. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> Town Manager <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said no evacuation outside the mill area was necessary. A preliminary investigation indicated that the chlorine gas escaped from a chemical-sampling line when a bleaching plant in the mill shut down, IP said. The problem apparently resulted from the failure of a valve to shut off automatically after a cutoff of electricity halted the bleaching process, said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyford </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The leak lasted about 10 to 15 minutes and was largely contained within a mill building, <PERSON> Lyford </PERSON> said. IP spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> said the injured workers were `` outside contractors, and not <LOCATION> Androscoggin </LOCATION> mill employees, who were working on a capital project in the pulp mill.'' He said the area was cleared within five minutes and workers returned to the affected area within 45 minutes. `` It was n't a human error'' that caused the leak, said <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON>. `` It was a problem in the process and that is being investigated.'' The commissioners of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Human Services and Labor departments toured the mill Sunday afternoon with officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lyford </PERSON> said. The governor, who also sent his public safety commissioner to the mill, ordered IP to cease its bleaching operations, in which chlorine is used. <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> called for a thorough inspection by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> after a leak of more than 100,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide Feb. 4. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that it would assign inspectors to the mill in an effort to prevent future leaks. The leak of chlorine dioxide, which like chlorine is used in the bleaching process, forced nearly 4,000 people to leave <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> and nearby communities for several hours. On Jan. 28, eight workers were rushed to hospitals after a hydrogen sulfide gas leak at the mill. <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> officials are worried about potential injuries to residents as well as mill employees. `` We remain very interested in what goes on at that mill,'' said <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>. He criticized legislators last week for doing too little to defuse what he sees as a volatile situation in a town already tense over an 8-month-old labor dispute at the paper mill. More than 1,200 members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firemen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Oilers </ORGANIZATION> at the IP mill have been on strike since mid-June. IP has hired hundreds of what it calls permanent replacements. Five workers were taken to <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, and three were admitted in stable but guarded condition and two were released, said spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who said chlorine gas can be `` extremely toxic.'' `` They are all conscious, alert and responsive,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, adding that effects of chlorine poisoning can show up 12 to 18 hours after exposure. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> said two people taken there were released Sunday afternoon.

 About 150 Valentine's Day greetings addressed to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other foreign captives were received from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist newspaper As-Safir `` We received them by mail from all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We shall run samples in Monday's edition,'' said <PERSON> As-Safir </PERSON>'s deputy editor <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashmoushi </PERSON>. The letters, many emblazoned with red hearts, were picked up Sunday morning in the newspaper's mailbox at the central post office. He said more than three-quarters of the messages were addressed to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, the longest-held foreigner in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. One message came from his sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, N.Y. It said, `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, we love you so much and we'll never give up the fight for your freedom.'' One or two messages were addressed to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped June 9, 1985. A few messages were addressed to missing <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 48 who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving a west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel for a meeting with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>'s captors. The two Americans are held by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, an underground group believed made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. There were a few messages addressed to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> professors <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. They were kidnapped from the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 24, 1987. Twenty-four foreigners, including eight Americans, are being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In a videotape released by his captors on Christmas Eve, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he had seen some of the Christmas cards his friends and countrymen sent to him, published by As-Safir. In other developments, the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said thumbprints alleged to be those of two kidnapped Scandinavian employees provided by their captors were sent Sunday to forensic experts for verification. The thumbprints were on a note left at a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Saturday. The note failed to identify the abductors, but it said the two captives, Swede <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, and Norwegian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, would be freed within a week if their current interrogation proved their `` innocence.'' The note carried no specific charges of which the two captives should be innocent, however. In <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> official said it was `` well known that arms were found'' on a cargo ship that was seized Dec. 27 by Christian militiamen in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The three <PERSON> Danes </PERSON>, three Poles, two Sri Lankans and a seaman from <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> aboard the vessel were released Saturday. <PERSON> Ole </PERSON> <PERSON> Neustrup </PERSON>, Danish charge d'affaires to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, said the arms were aboard the ship, which was carrying foodstuffs. <PERSON> Neustrup </PERSON> accompanied the freed sailors from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after negotiating with their captors, members of the right-wing Lebanese Forces militia. But <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biel </PERSON>, captain of the frieghter Ingawebb, said he knew nothing about arms aboard the ship. The Christian militia had accused the crew of unloading arms for the <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before sailing into the Lebanese capital's harbor, press reports said. The Druse militia is the main foe of the Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s nearly 13-year-old civil war.

 Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian students occupying a University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> building for the third day said Sunday a church had pledged money and restaurants had donated hot meals. `` We have n't even had to leave the building to buy food,'' said <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, 21, a junior from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The estimated 125 demonstrators have held the New Africa Hall on the UMass campus since Friday to protest an attack on two black students allegedly beaten by whites and other recent incidents at the school. Protesters allowed reporters into a small room on the ground floor of the hall to answer questions. The building showed no signs of occupation, such as banners and pickets, and there were no police officers outside. Protesters said they would occupy the four-story brick building until Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> met demands including the suspension of five white students accused of the Feb. 7 beatings. The third day of the takeover began with a worship service led by the Rev. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. `` A lot of people here are religious and did make a commitment to stay here until this is resolved,'' said <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 24, a senior from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Along with sleeping accommodations and food, there are religious needs we have to take care of.'' Other demonstrators left briefly for showers and breakfast at home, Ms. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> said. Group leaders talked with black administrators Sunday in preparation for a meeting with the chancellor on their demands, which were being revised to include more funds for minority activities and increased hiring of minority faculty, she said. Only 41 of the 1,339 faculty members and 5 percent of the 20,000 undergraduates are black, mirroring a nationwide decline in the number of black applicants in the last several years, according to the school. Blacks at the university say an undercurrent of racism has not abated since October 1986, when blacks and whites clashed following the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> loss to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> in the final game of the World Series. Six white students eventually pleaded no contest to varying charges. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> has acknowledged that racism continues to be a problem at the school. `` I think we've got a continuing problem with harassment and abuse,'' the chancellor said. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was trying to avoid a confrontation with protesters when school resumes Tuesday, university spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. `` We're being as patient as we possibly can,'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think you'll see any arrests. They are being very peaceful.'' `` This is not a mob,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, 26, a graduate student from <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` Hostility breeds hostility,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` We're almost in the 1990s and racial hostility is still happening. I'm sick of it.'' Protesters have received $ 575 from students and faculty members, a pledge for $ 5,000 from the Convent Avenue Baptist Church of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, food from <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> restaurants, and blankets, sleeping bags and pillows, Ms. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> said. A spokeswoman for the Convent Avenue church, who asked that her name not be used, confirmed that the church had offered support, including financial aid, but declined to confirm the $ 5,000 figure.

 Leftist guerillas kidnapped five mayors of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s political party and three reporters to send a message about upcoming local elections, a Columbian radio network said Sunday. One mayor who was abducted later was released, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> and other newspapers said. <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> said it received a telephone call at its station in <LOCATION> Cucuta </LOCATION> claiming the kidnappings Friday were by the communist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The caller, who did not identify himself, said the rebels planned to release all of those kidnapped and give them messages to give to the government about the March 13 nationwide election of mayors, <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> said. All five mayors belong to <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has pledged to fight the threat posed by leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Since Jan. 1 the guerrilla group has bombed the country's main oil pipeline a dozen times, ambushed two army patrols, blown up electricity transmission towers and attacked a town. On Feb. 5 the rebels set off a car bomb in front of the Colombian headquarters of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> oil company, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>.

 About 4,000 troops backed by helicopters and warships stood guard Monday as voters in <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION> province chose local officials in the final stage of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' violence-marred regional elections. On the eve of the balloting, armed factions loyal to rival mayoral candidates traded mortar and automatic weapon fire outside the town of <LOCATION> Maimbung </LOCATION>, 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The military said at least four people have been killed and dozens wounded in clashes between rival factions in the largely Moslem province since Friday. About 214,000 voters in the southern island province were to elect three governors, 18 mayors and 126 members of town and provincial councils. Col. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abendan </PERSON>, Philippine Constabulary chief in <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION>, said the four were killed Friday when about 50 armed men attacked Maimbung on the southern coast of <LOCATION> Jolo </LOCATION> island.

In nearby Luuk, rival political groups traded fire with automatic weapons, but there were no reported fatalities, he said. Most Filipinos voted Jan. 18 in an election that President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said restored full democracy after the February 1986 ouster of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Voting was postponed in 11 of the 73 provinces because of fears of violence from communist rebels and regional warlords.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took a 1930s-era train through <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s Lakes Region Sunday to tell voters to get the country `` back on track'' by choosing him in Tuesday's presidential primary Standing on the back of the red caboose in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told about 300 supporters, including 100 who came on school buses from <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, to stand up against what he calls `` economic violence.'' `` Most poor people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are not on welfare,'' he said. `` They work every day. And when they get done working, they're still poor. `` We, the people, can win,'' he said. The crowd endured 20-degree temperatures and a brisk wind as they stood in front of the station, its roof dripping with three-and four-foot icicles. `` It's worth all the cold feet,'' said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Anathan </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to ride <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s train. She said she liked the way he addressed the problems of lower-income people. Ten-year-old <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Proule </PERSON> held up a Valentine that said `` I Love <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.'' He handed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the Valentine and a red rose. Supporters then got on the `` Rainbow Express,'' which chugged along at 10 to 15 miles per hour, to <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION>. A retired teacher from <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> said, `` I like the way he says things and he's mature ... Last night the others acted like children,'' she said. Banjo player <PERSON> Court </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> went from chilly car to car singing `` It's a Rainbow Train a-coming.'' `` We are winning together, - gether, - gether,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sang with <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> as the train passed <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winnipesaukee </LOCATION>, which was covered with ice fishing huts and snowmobile `` And we are freezing here together,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added. The coal stove in one of the three cars went out several times on the trip. In <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addressed crowds of between 200 and 300 people and asked them repeatedly `` Who're you going to vote for?'' `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' they responded. `` I've stood with you.

He's done a lot for the underdog and it would be a thrill to see him in the White House,'' she said. `` I wo n't -LRB- vote for him -RRB-, because I do n't think he has a chance.'' The train, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Winnipesaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, cost the campaign $ 1,500 to use. Its trips are normally limited to fall foliage tours and some freight hauling. <PERSON> Daris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he had come up with a group of 31 students from <ORGANIZATION> Cheyney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to canvass for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` This has been a great trip.

A group of 10 - and 11-year old girls, who shivered next to the stove near <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s car, were n't so sure `` We're never going to get home,'' said one. At the end of the line in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to a rally of workers from <ORGANIZATION> Guilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who have been on strike since Nov. 13.

 Laotian gunners reportedly shot down a Thai plane that was on a reconnaissance mission over an embattled border area, state-run Radio <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> said Sunday. It was the second plane the Thais said they lost in the battle for remote hills over which both countries have claimed sovereignty. The radio said the American-made OV-10, a twin-engine turboprop used for counter-insurgency and night surveillance, was shot down Saturday near Hill 1428, one of the most fiercely contested areas. The other plane, an American-made F-5E jet fighter-bomber, was downed Feb. 4. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has launched frequent air strikes to try to dislodge hundreds of Laotian soldiers entrenched in the hills that lie along the border between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Phitsanulok </LOCATION> province and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' Sayaboury province.

<HEAD>Steelworkers Vote For Proposed Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former employees of a steel mill shut down eight years ago voted overwhelmingly Sunday to accept a settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that will give them $ 14.8 million in benefits. The vote by former <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> employees was 583-75 to approve the settlement, which provides about $ 67 million less than the workers initially had sought, said attorney <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, who represents the 2,700 workers. `` These are old people. They have been fighting this case for years and years, and they're very happy it's settled,'' Ms. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said after the vote at a local union hall. The vote is not binding, said attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Despres </PERSON>, another workers' representative. But he called it `` highly persuasive.'' `` The plan has to be determined by a judge,'' he said. `` But the overwhelming vote makes his approval very likely.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, then known as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, sold the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Steel Works shortly before it went into bankruptcy and was shut down in 1980. The `` Save Our Jobs Committee,'' representing the mill workers, filed an $ 82 million lawsuit against IH, contending it sold the mill to escape the payment of termination benefits if the plant closed, <PERSON> Despres </PERSON> said. The $ 14.8 million figure was suggested as a compromise by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, after two months of mediation sessions, <PERSON> Despres </PERSON> said. The settlement goes back to <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> for final approval. If the settlement is approved, each employee could receive an amount ranging from $ 200 to $ 17,000, based on age and length of employment, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> offices were closed Sunday and company officials could not be reached for comment.

 The recent spate of skittish economic indicators is raising concerns that the next president will take office without the tools to combat a recession, even if an election-year downturn can be avoided. That's because the federal budget deficit has grown so huge that the historical remedies for jolting an economy out of a recession _ lower taxes and more federal spending _ simply will not be available to the next president, a growing number of analysts suggest. In fact, if anything, the next occupant of the Oval Office will be under extreme pressure to press for higher taxes to reduce the budget deficit _ a tactic that would become all but impossible during an actual recession.

 Girls should be encouraged to exercise vigorously enough to delay their puberty, because this may help protect them from breast cancer and other diseases later in life, a researcher said Sunday. Grade school girls who play strenuous sports often have their first menstrual period, or menarche, later than usual. Even after adolescence starts, they may miss periods if they work out regularly. Although delayed or missing menstruation is often thought to be abnormal, some experts now say that it is natural and even desirable, because it may protect the body from the damaging effects of sex hormones.

<HEAD>Jaymar-Ruby Hopes Belt Loops Will Boost Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Jaymar-Ruby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which popularized the no-belt look for men's slacks, has decided there's a future in belt loops. Tired of battling the image that it's stretchy waistbands are only for pot-bellies, the company is readying a new advertising campaign to tell the world that <PERSON> Sansabelt </PERSON> is an old name with new style. While conventional Sansabelt _ beltless _ slacks will still be sold, <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON> also will be offering pants designed for belts in 1988, in a marked departure from its 29-year-old marketing strategy. <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hand </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Jaymar-Ruby </PERSON>'s acting president, said he got the idea for the change while watching the Masters' golf tournament last April. Hand, who is chief operating officer of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartmarx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Jaymar </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company -RRB- says he remembers seeing a wide range of men wearing Sansabelt `` Old guys and young guys and fat guys and skinny guys,'' <PERSON> Hand </PERSON> said. `` And those who seemed like they cared about how they looked, and those who did n't.'' Hand said there is a `` stereotypical image'' of the average Sansabelt wearer _ slightly overweight, interested in comfort, uninterested in fashion. He decided it was time to wage war against that cliche. Hand said that while <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON> had an impressive 20-to-25-percent share of the men's quality -LRB- $ 40 and up -RRB- slacks market, it embarked last summer on an extensive consumer survey to find out what men liked and disliked in fashion. The survey indicated a lot more men than the company had ever realized could n't stand pants without belts, <PERSON> Hand </PERSON> said. `` The answers there were fairly clear,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON>'s vice president for marketing communications. `` It's part of ` the look.' It's like a white-collar guy not wearing a tie to work.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McGue </PERSON>, who took over as <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON>'s president in October, says pro-belt customers were found to be `` an awesome segment of the better slacks business.'' At the same time, it was becoming apparent that <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON>'s 1987 sales would fail to break records for the first time in 10 years, and that 1987 profits would lag behind those of 1986. Sansabelt-with-a-belt was born last summer after <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON> executives searched their corporate soul and the idea was endorsed by <PERSON> McGue </PERSON> when he took control. For five weeks now, sales people have been writing orders for the new-style slacks with considerable success, company executives say. The fall line will hit stores next summer. Because Sansabelt is a French and English amalgamation that literally means `` with no belt,'' an obvious risk is that the new strategy will confuse customers. `` I know it's a contradiction in terms,'' Hand admitted. But <PERSON> Jaymar </PERSON> executives predict they can retain the Sansabelt customer who has sworn by beltless pants for decades. They also think they can attract a more trend-conscious, perhaps younger man who does n't associate the brand name with `` no belt'' anyway. `` It's addressing a market that we've never addressed before that's a huge market,'' <PERSON> McGue </PERSON> said. To spread the word about the new Sansabelt line, the company will undertake the biggest advertising campaign of its recent history. Ads, beginning in late August and September, will show younger-looking models wearing both beltless and belt-style Sansabelt slacks. The new slogan will be, `` With a belt, without a belt _ Sansabelt fashion, it feels great.'' Magazine ads will appear in Gentlemen's Quarterly, Sports Illustrated, <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> magazine and other publications.

 Sales at the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> softened with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy a few years ago, but officials devised new marketing strategies that have begun paying off for this nationally known wholesale complex. The Market Center, a 150-acre complex of wholesale showrooms contained in eight buildings, typically draws 500,000 buyers a year. The center handles about $ 6.5 billion worth of wholesale orders annually. Last year, the number of buyers was down, but the number of stores represented was up. `` We look at two things when we're talking about the number of buyers: quality and quantity,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, president of the center's Hardgoods Division, which includes furniture, floor covering, lighting, jewelry and bath-bed-linen industries. `` In 1987, we had the healthiest year we've had in four years -LRB- in the Hardgoods Division -RRB-. We held our own in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Our growth came out of the other regions of the country. We have done a lot of marketing to those other regions.'' Buyer attendance dropped 9.1 percent last year in the Softgoods division, which includes men's, women's and children's apparel and related merchandise.
