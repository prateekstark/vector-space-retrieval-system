<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not advance interim solutions to the Palestinian problem and urged that any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan aim for a final settlement through an international conference. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> separately outlined that position in remarks to reporters. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Monday for a one-day visit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the end of this month. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have said a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan was outlined to Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for near <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs. The Egyptian president visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month and held talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> last week. However, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said: `` The Americans have not given us a specific -LRB- peace -RRB- plan.'' `` But we have taken the position that any plan must clearly include: first, an overall settlement of the problem and, second, an international conference as a framework without any attempt to outflank it.'' For any peace plan to succeed, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said, it must envisage `` the final outcome, and we must stay away from any words or provisions that were in the Camp David agreements because they are outdated and finished.'' He referred to an autonomy plan outlined in one of the U.S.-mediated 1978 Camp David accords between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It provided for an interim arrangement under which the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967, would exercise self-rule for five years. The plan also provided that negotiations begin not later than the third year of autonomy to consider the final status of the two territories. Reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> last week said a two-stage plan carried by <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> suggested an accelerated version of the Camp David formula. The reports said the plan proposed talks, to be held under international sponsorship, on limited Palestinian self-rule as an interim measure. Those talks would begin in April and negotiations on the final status of the two territories would be held in December, the reports said. After his 90-minute meeting with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> opposed `` partial solutions or projects for self-rule'' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> wants a final settlement through an international conference, he added. The state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> carried a message to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> from King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> did not comment on any message. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reports suggested that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s tour will be to sell the two-stage plan to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s remarks on Monday appeared to reflect serious reservations about the reported plan. `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is coming and if he is bringing proposals to offer to the parties concerned, I hope they will keep away from Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> and will cover a final solution,'' he said. He said an international conference `` would give all parties confidence.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes an international conference, contending it would pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into making territorial concessions. If a peace plan does not seek a final settlement through an internatiuonal conference, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said, `` the consequences will not be good. `` I do not wish for any initiative to fail. I wish for an initiative that aims for a final solution establishing just peace in the region.'' <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> reiterated <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s demand for a United Nations-sponsored international conference with the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s five permanent members and all concerned parties, including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are against any plan dealing with partial solutions or projects for self-rule. We seek a final settlement ... Our assessment of any initiative will depend on how close it comes to the position I have stated.'' Since Palestinian demonstrations against Israeli rule broke out Dec. 8, more than 50 Arabs have died of Israeli gunfire.

 In <LOCATION> Ottumwa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietraszewski </PERSON> stood in the doorway at the place where the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus was held last Monday night to encourage shy voters to cross the threshhold for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. She was a soldier in <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` invisible army.'' `` There were two of mine that could n't come because they were sick, but there were four who surprised me,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Pietraszewski </PERSON>, 35, mother of two. `` I knew them all as they came in; I went out and personally met them so they would n't be afraid to go to the caucus.'' When the heads were counted, there were 64, and 43 of them gave the nod to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Statewide, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> finished second, behind <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> but ahead of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ a shock to many, but not to some <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> people who like Mrs. <PERSON> Pietraszewski </PERSON> had been working for their candidate for months. -LRB- `` I told my family there will be lots of other Christmases, but this one's different.'' -RRB- The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ground troops, new to politics and excited by success, are starting to ask themselves if they have it within their power to put their man in office. `` A lot of people have said, well, I agree with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s stands, but I do n't want to waste my vote,'' the Rev <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> told the <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> -RRB- Monitor. `` That was before <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. My impression is now he's a little more electable. There may indeed be a groundswell.'' The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, puts it this way: `` If <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> is God's man then somehow he's going to get in there But not without a lot of hard work and prayer.'' And the Rev. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchers </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, tells of a lunch that a group of clergymen had with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. After getting to know him as a person, <PERSON> Borchers </PERSON> said, `` We all laid our hands on him and prayed for him. We prayed for strength and guidance and prayed if it is God's will, that he be elected.'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> sociologist and a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> biographer, says <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> came up with a masterstroke in insisting that three million followers sign petitions before he would decide to run. The tactic gave <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> an army. `` He asked people to pledge that they'd work for him, pray for him and give him money,'' says <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>. `` Political historians may view it as one of the most ingenious things a candidate ever did.'' These days, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> soft pedals the church-based foundation of his candidacy. He says he should be thought of as a television network executive and the chancellor of a fully accredited graduate university. To call him merely a TV evangelist, he protests `` is bigotry and it's an insult. And it denigrates who I am and what I am and I'm sick of it.'' For all that, most of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s followers come out of the evangelical churches of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They know him best as a man of God _ and they speak of him, often, in language unblushingly tinged with theology. `` I just believe <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is going to win,'' says <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Widmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` He operates in miraculous wonders in terms of what the Bible says _ prophecy, healing, miracles. He operates just like <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> did and he loves just like <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> did. And we need a man of God in the office.'' In <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Billye </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoik </PERSON>, who quit her job as a church secretary to work for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, scoffs at the term the press has given <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s political flock. `` These are just your common, everyday folks from various and sundry backgrounds and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> is touching these people,'' she says. Mrs. <PERSON> Knoik </PERSON>, mother of three grown children, got to know <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> from watching the 700 Club on the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where on Tuesday <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> faces his first test in a primary, Mrs. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, town chairman and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s local coordinator, says the conventional wisdom _ that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will have trouble in a primary election _ has missed the point. `` It's there,'' she says of a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> post-Iowa surge. `` There's a tremendous force that has n't been really identified in the normal political process.'' Registration ended last weekend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and city and town clerks say they were so busy for three weeks they did n't have time to leave their offices and grab lunch. The lines were long. Nearly 1,000 people registered in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> on a Saturday. Many are first-time voters. Many registered undeclared, meaning they can vote Democrat or Republican. Secretary of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> estimates the late surge added 15,000 to 25,000 voters in a state where <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won the primary in 1980 with 73,000 votes. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> ca n't guess how many of the new registrants are <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters. The Rev. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, a pastor at the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamsphire </LOCATION>, says in 1986 about 50,000 residents of the state gave money to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. After <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, all the candidates flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, which holds caucuses Feb. 23 and where a strong `` pro-life'' movement has ties to fundamentalist churches. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> co-chairman, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludeman </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is no longer <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s greatest threat. `` We feel that in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> we have only one competitor in grass roots organization, that's <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> won overwhelmingly in the Feb. 4 Republican caucuses, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> credits a 60 percent rise in party registration tp <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s appeal. Says <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> co-chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>: `` We draw from mainstream conservatives, evangelicals and those who know <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> from the 700 Club.'' In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, retiree <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, a lay pastor, says <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s appeal politicized the non-political _ like himself. `` I've got to get with it,'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> tells a reporter. `` I've got to get involved I'm ashamed to say that's the first caucus I ever attended.'' Were <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> people in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> told to be evasive to pollsters so the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> strength would come as a surprise? No, <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> says: `` People have a little bit of a problem with the role of the media. They were tight-lipped on the thing.'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> activist who has worked for a number of Christian causes: `` We had a lot of people support <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> who we referred to as closet supporters. I saw that in my own precinct. I saw people we had n't identified, people we did n't know. There were extra numbers here that we were n't aware of.'' The Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelms </PERSON>, pastor a <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, says evangelical churches did n't outright support <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, but they sure gave up preaching that politics is securlar business to be shunned in favor of the Lord's work. `` For years, we heard Christians should stay out of politics,'' he says. `` Of late, our leaders have encouraged the opposite.''

<HEAD>Rule Barring Abortion Advice Dealt Blow By Federal Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Monday temporarily barred enforcement of a new federal rule that prevents federally funded family planning clinics from advising pregnant women on abortion. The ruling applies to three organizations in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that brought suit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> granted the motion by the three birth control services groups seeking a preliminary injuction against the new rule scheduled to go into effect March 3. `` The order just says the government can not put these regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a final hearing,'' <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a week. She also said two other similar cases are before federal judges in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Filing the suit against the government were Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Women </LOCATION>'s Health Clinic. The ruling temporarily barring enforcement of the rule applies only to those three organizations, <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> said. The suit claims new federal ruling violates the Federal Title X statute and the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, censors free speech rights at family planning clinics and violates the right of privacy of clinics and their patients. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> had ruled that beginning March 3, family planning programs receiving federal funds could not provide pregnant women with information on abortion or refer them to other sources, even if they ask. Administration officials have said the rule is intended to make sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion, even indirectly. <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> said she based her decision on many <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings that said there could not be rules that `` dictated to doctors what they say to patients, which is what the regulations attempted to do.'' `` Based on that finding, and the fact that all of these cases indicated that such attempted regulation was unconstitutional, I found irreparable injury. The last two prongs for such a preliminary injunction are a balancing of harms to the plaintiff and against harms to the defendant,'' the judge said. The order will be in writing and out by the end of the week, she said. The judge said she made the ruling on a holiday, Presidents' Day, because it was the only date when the two sides and she could get together `` The government wanted it heard as soon as possible. The plaintiffs ... wanted it heard before the regs -LRB- regulations -RRB- went into effect on March 3. I said fine, if you want to come in on a holiday, I will too,'' <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> said.

 When <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign bus pulls into shopping malls, the driver turns on his tapes of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> marches and passers-by strut on the sidewalks. Inside, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and his aides are busy passing out a different type of cassette _ his positions on issues ranging from abortion to defense. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign for the Republican nomination for the presidency is as much showmanship as it is politics. It's one of the slickest shows in town now finishing its run in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and heading South next. At a major rally to fire up supporters, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who starred as <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> in the smash Broadway musical 10 years ago, sings the hit song, `` Tomorrow.'' And as the song goes, you can bet your bottom dollar that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is hoping the sun will come out tomorrow, er Tuesday, in the form of a strong showing in the New Hampshrie primary. At a rally in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> Saturday night, you'd have thought <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had already won his party's nomination. It had all the trappings, the straw hats and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> placards, of a nominating convention. Eight hundred supporters clapped, stomped their feet and chanted: `` We want <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>! We want <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>!'' `` Go, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, go! Go, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, go!'' Then, of course, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> came out on stage and whipped the crowd into a frenzy. `` When I look at your faces and see this enthusiasm, I believe we are going to see victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I'm talking to people who love <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> This state represents what's good in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because it stands for faith in God It stands for strong family values. It stands for preservation of life for the unborn.'' And when you ask around in the malls and at the rallies about <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, his followers tell you he stands for all those things. Simple as that, they say. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON>, a mother of five children from <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, sang a couple of inspirational songs for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. One of them was `` Ca n't We Be Friends.'' _ `` Ca n't we be friends. Life's too short. Too soon it ends. And good friends are so hard to find. Ca n't we be friends. Someone like you is one of a kind.'' The second one, `` Eagle Song,'' she wrote herself: `` An eagle tucked with golden wings is flying on his way upward, heavenward bound.'' `` I feel that's what <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>'s calling is,'' she said later. `` That's what I believe <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> is meant to do. He's my man.'' <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> drove 30 miles from <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION> to see <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> this night. She explained that she was an `` 8_88.'' That means she found eight more voters to support <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in'88. `` He's a solid man,'' she said. `` He stands for a lot of good things. He stands on the Bible for one thing. He's a good Christian man.'' At the malls, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> works the crowds relentlessly. He's in pizza parlors, bookstores and barber shops, smiling, shaking hands, embracing voters. At a candy shop, he wishes voters a happy Valentine's Day, then matter-of-factly says to them, `` I need some help on Tuesday.''

 <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the preacher's wife, delivered the prophecy at a noon prayer meeting late in December: `` The Lord said he was going to send a tornado, and many shall die,'' she recalls, saying <PERSON> God </PERSON> spoke through her during the prayer service. `` He was going to send his fury and vengeance on the people.'' So 17 faithful members of the Repairer of the <ORGANIZATION> Breach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> in Christ gathered at their small westside church _ a converted two-story frame house _ on Jan. 3 to await the wrath of God. The congregation has been waiting, faithfully, peacefully, ever since. Any day now, any moment, members believe, <PERSON> God </PERSON> will send a tornado spinning down from the heavens to smite the wicked and spare the righteous. And spare their church. Their number includes a school teacher, a recent college graduate, a college freshman, and a restaurant worker with a management degree. They have sacrificed jobs and education, as well as the respect of family and friends who question their sanity. The congregation has been challenged by the power of the state, too. Five members have been removed under court order _ though two of them have returned since undergoing forced psychiatric examinations. Two children were taken from their mother and returned to school, and a 51-year-old man was ordered to undergo kidney dialysis treatment. But unlike a Mormon polygamist clan in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> whose recent resistance of police ended in a shootout that killed one officer, these religious fundamentalists have quietly accepted the intrusions. `` We're not against the court,'' says M.L. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the church elder and preacher, the husband of <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>. `` If God allows it to happen, then that's it.'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 36, says he's also lost the support of national church headquarters in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which ordered him to take down a sign proclaiming affiliation. `` Until the Lord says to move it, it's going to be up,'' he says. A woman who answered a call at the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> headquarters said no one was available to discuss the matter. Despite the challenges from outsiders, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and the church members welcome visitors and talk freely. All profess an unshakeable belief in the tornado. None say they want to leave. The 39-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> first prophesied the tornado would strike Jan. 3, then Jan. 24. Both dates passed uneventfully. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> now say God delayed the tornado to gain time to spread the warning. No new date has been set. `` It'll be pretty soon,'' says <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. `` It's nationally known now.'' No one's faith is shaken by the delay, or by meteorological precedent. `` Tornadoes can occur anytime, but most of the tornadoes in this area occur from March through June, and then again late in the fall,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowery </PERSON>, who says he ca n't recall a midwinter tornado ever striking the area. Religion professor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivelle </PERSON>, chairman of the department at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says apocalyptic visions are common religious themes. `` Of course there are always reasons why the end never comes,'' he said. `` I always tell my students that religion is not logic, and you can not put logical questions to that.'' One of those waiting in the church, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a 24-year-old graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Grinnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> with a major in Spanish, said, `` There's no doubt in my mind, or in anyone's mind that it's going to come.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> stopped showing up for his bank teller's job after Jan. 3, then called the bank to explain. `` They did n't really understand it,'' he said. `` But after the tornado comes they'll understand, and they'll congratulate us for standing up for the Lord.'' The family of <PERSON> Ruschell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> school teacher, and her 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jeanetta </PERSON>, won the court order compelling the two to undergo psychiatric evaluation. `` Really, at the time, they felt I was so deeply under the influence of pastor that we could n't do our own thinking,'' she said. `` If I believe something, and it's different from what you believe, does that make me insane and you not?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she and her daughter returned voluntarily to the church after a psychiatrist found them competent. `` I'm 47 years old. I've been teaching for 20 years. I've taken my daughter out of school,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> indignantly. `` Do you think I would be here if I did n't believe it?'' <PERSON> Jeanetta </PERSON> says it does n't matter she's missing out on school. `` It does n't bother me because after the tornado, the school may not be there.'' A court gave custody of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' two sons, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 12, to a brother, who will return them to school. Child welfare authorities took the children from the church. `` I do n't fight that. They're just doing their job,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` They do n't understand, because this is spiritual.'' The days are occupied with informal services, talking and just waiting. `` Praise God, because this world is coming to an end, and we want to be right,'' chanted <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> during one service. `` People say we're strange, they say we're crazy, that we're crackpots,'' he intones, mopping sweat from his face with a towel thrown around his beefy shoulders. `` But we're just doing what <PERSON> God </PERSON> says to do.'' `` Better be so ready, you may not know the day,'' sings the congregation, now a choir whose voice reverberates off bright blue-painted plaster walls. There is no television or radio in the church, and no newspapers. Adult members take turns preparing meals in the fully equipped kitchen, and the teen-agers clean up. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> live upstairs. At night, the others fold up the metal chairs and spread out bedding. The cramped quarters are part of the sacrifice. `` We've all sacrificed here,'' says 18-year-old <PERSON> Falease </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON>, who dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univerity </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> campus. `` God is going to pay us in return.'' <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the preacher's 18-year-old daughter, says the waiting will be ended soon. `` We'll be out there after the tornado,'' she says. `` Then the world will be a better place to live, with everybody doing <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s will.

 The French, known for fickleness in politics and love, have become so enamored of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> that they affectionately call him Uncle and his following often is compared to a cult. With presidential elections less than three months away, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is a phantom candidate. He says he has not decided on seeking re-election, but draws celebrities, scientists and ordinary citizens onto his bandwagon in an effortless non-campaign. Politicians who have spoken with the 71-year-old Socialist say he will declare his intentions in early March. The first-round vote is set for April 24. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is called more and more by the nickname <PERSON> Tonton </PERSON>, an affectionate term for uncle. He has become a sort of political superstar, imperturbable and lovable in his presidential grandeur. Lacking a declared rival in the Socialist opposition, Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and former Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> have a problem. The two leading conservatives are reduced to shadow-boxing with the avuncular <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> image at the risk of looking like family bullies. `` <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would be well advised to give an answer soon,'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said recently. `` A presidential election is an important affair.'' <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> has criticized `` the often abusive use of an image, that of the nice old uncle. It's both charming and fuzzy. It's sweet tonton.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s popularity has risen since his Socialist government lost power to the <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> conservatives in March 1986. He has led opinion polls for months, but the phenomenon called `` Mitterrandolatry'' or `` Tontonmania'' is recent. With the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> not conducting an official campaign, independent committees began springing up around the country, gathering signatures and putting up <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> posters. Groups of noted scientists, intellectuals, homosexuals and others advertised their support. Actor <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Depardieu </PERSON> said he never votes, but he bought a full-page newspaper ad declaring: `` Mitterrand or nothing.'' The rock star <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> sponsored a similar ad, urging the president to `` hang in there.'' <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamet </PERSON>, editor of the right-wing newspaper <PERSON> Quotidien </PERSON> de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was among hundreds of people who signed an appeal saying, `` Do n't Leave Us.'' He was fired immediately. Justice Minister <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalandon </PERSON> compared the president's relationship with the French to that of Marshal <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Petain </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Vichy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> government that collaborated with the German occupation in World War II Many of the French were scandalized by the comparison. <PERSON> Chalandon </PERSON> called the situation `` irrational'' and said the campaign climate risked becoming one of `` soft, vague demagogy.'' Indeed, pro-Mitterrand letters being published speak of `` Dr. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>,'' his `` intellectual firmness'' and his `` cultural finesse.'' A quarterly magazine named Influence quoted a former dancer at the <ORGANIZATION> Crazy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> nightclub as saying <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is not a sex symbol, `` but he is so soft, with such a watchful air, that it gives him in my eyes great charm. Without mentioning his intelligence, which seduces me completely.'' Historian <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Julliard </PERSON>, who studies public opinion and contemporary political culture, says `` Tontonmania'' is explainable. `` Always in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> there is the role of the providential man,'' he said in a telephone interview. As a president sharing power with a conservative premier, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has a high profile without the blame for unpopular government policies. `` He is a president who does n't govern,'' <ORGANIZATION> Julliard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` When he officially becomes a candidate, he'll start losing points.'' One of many recent polls indicated 61 percent of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people want <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> as president, 48 percent prefer <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and 40 percent favor <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. In early 1986, when a Socialist government still was in power, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s support was 39 percent. `` If <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is not officially a candidate, it is to make himself desired,'' wrote <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> July </PERSON>, editor of the leftist newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the view that the president's refusal to declare himself is a political tactic <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has made few comments about `` Tontonmania,'' saying only that he had no hand in the private efforts on his behalf. As he put it in late December: `` It's very nice of them. They did n't consult me and so I have neither to say go ahead nor to stop them.

 Two decades ago, affordable housing and a good highway system lured dozens of major companies to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s suburbs of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Today, highways are clogged, $ 500,000 homes are considered pedestrian, and a corporate exodus may be on the horizon. The waves of growth from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s global market, which once brought treasures to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s `` Gold Coast,'' now threaten to erode some of its most precious economic gains. Over the past year, at least a half dozen big companies have announced plans to close or relocate their <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> operations and many more are said to be considering such moves. A recent survey of 300 local manufacturers found a third considering partial or total relocations. The main gripe: The suburbs, which used to have the location without the cost of the Big Apple, have grown so clogged with people and cars that life here is no longer a bargain. `` Most people who make a move do a lot of looking and if they're after big cost differences, there's no longer a big cost difference between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Helie </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> real estate company, which has 16 offices in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> `` So, if they're looking for a lower-cost area, they're bound to move off the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.'' Housing prices have soared so that many homes are out of the reach of even some two-income families. In <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, the average price of a home has risen from $ 86,730 in 1970 to $ 706,150 last year, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, publisher of the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Record </LOCATION> of Real Estate Sales. He said the `` American Dream'' _ a four-bedroom home on one acre of land in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> _ costs a family about $ 540,000 today. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a state senator from <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, describes the situation on <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 95 </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Merritt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION> _ the region's major highways _ as `` absolutely horrendous. `` It's gridlock from 6:30 a.m. to after 8:30. A ride from <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> that should take 25 minutes takes more than one hour, and if every aspect of mass transportation was used by the year 2000, we'd still have hopeless gridlock,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodside </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said if some of these trends are n't stemmed, <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> could become a pasture for top executives with little commerce because people who work in the trades, restaurants and other businesses wo n't be able to afford to live here. <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION>, who moved <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters to <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> in 1970 when it was <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an economic planning organization for the tri-state region of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jesey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said that when companies moved to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in the 1970s, housing was affordable, land was plentiful and an ample labor pool was available. `` The county has changed dramatically already,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> has closed schools in the last 10 years and they do that because they no longer have enough kids to use the schools. No young people can afford to live in these cities.'' Evidence of a possible corporate exodus cropped up in 1987, when at least six companies pulled out of the area: _ <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it would move most of its regional operations from <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION> to its corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> The Fortune 500 forest products company employed 320 people in <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, making it the town's single largest employer. _ <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> about two years ago, said it planned to relocate its headquarters in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Stauffer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced it would close its headquarters in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> Its three main businesses were split up and the headquarters are moving to <LOCATION> Shelton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would shift its headquarters from <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Iomega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> returned to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> only a year after moving its headquarters to <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> Most cited the need for `` consolidation'' as the reason for leaving, but one knowledgeable observer said the high cost of staying in the area was a contributing factor. `` Essentially those who can break away and have no need to be in the command center of the global market are finding other locations and being in a sense pushed out or at least costed out by those who have to have that location,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of business groups and the state, said last year that twice as many manufacturers moved out of <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as moved in during the past five years. Manufacturing generates $ 10 billion in revenues and provides 36 percent of the jobs in the county, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrikas </PERSON>, president of the Wilton-based <ORGANIZATION> Vitta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the task force that directed the survey. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitovich </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <LOCATION> SACIA </LOCATION>, said he does n't believe `` the bloom is completely off the rose'' in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` When people look at the region and see some traffic patterns, some people like to attribute the erosion -LRB- of businesses -RRB- to traffic or cost, but that's not completely it. There's a range of things happening,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitovich </PERSON> said some of the companies that moved to the region in the 1970s are no longer here because they have been merged with others or bought out. Corporate executives at companies that have not announced any plans to move decline to discuss the possibility of relocating because it worries their employees. But when <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the survey research firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, asked chief executive officers to name the best major metropolitan area in which to locate a business, none of the 403 executives ranked any <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> cities in the top tier. They said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was the best location. `` Overall, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, which includes <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, does get a pretty bad rap,'' said <PERSON> Merl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, executive vice president of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 Twenty-six states are now wheedling extra dollars from their taxpayers with lottery games, helping senior citizens in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, schools in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and economic development in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Total sales exceeded $ 12 billion last year. Eight states sell $ 1 billion or more in lottery tickets a year, keeping a third or more of that amount to support state programs. Within the last year, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> have joined the club, and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> will begin games this year. Though most states report rising income from wagering, some have to hustle to keep bettors interested. Last week, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> scrapped a lotto game that had sold $ 2.2 billion worth of tickets since 1982 and launched a `` Wild Card Lotto'' game. Players in the old game picked six numbers out of 40, but the new game has 48 choices. That changes the odds of winning from one in 1.9 million to one in 6.1 million. That, in turn, increases the chances of creating one of those humongous $ 30 million or $ 40 million jackpots that inspire frantic ticket sales. `` We've had so many people who've won a million or more, it now takes a pot of $ 10 million to generate the interest that $ 5 million did once,'' says <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipp-Klecha </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the lottery in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where on Sunday officials said someone was holding a $ 17 million ticket after the latest drawing. `` People like to spend a dollar to have a shot at the moon,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lottery. That's also the theory behind the new six-state `` Lotto America'' game, launched last week in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. With more bettors to lose money, the game can offer bigger prizes _ a minimum of $ 2 million. `` Our motivation is to offer Oregonians a chance to play in games they could play in one of the big states,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, whose state lottery faces big-jackpot competition along the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> border. No one picked all seven numbers to win the jackpot in the first <LOCATION> Lotto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> drawing held Saturday night. More than 2 million tickets were sold, spokesman <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> legislators, who have seen lottery sales slump from $ 136.9 million in the first year, 1982-83, to as low as $ 105.3 million in fiscal 1985, are debating a big-jackpot lotto game this year. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, assistant director of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lottery, credits the state's `` Super Lotto'' game with helping build ticket sales from $ 100 million in the first year, 1974-75, to $ 1.07 billion last year. There are seven other states in the billion-dollar club: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has the most lucrative games, earning $ 666.8 million on sales of $ 1.46 billion, a 45 percent profit, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1987. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> all extract more than 40 percent from their games as well. However, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s 2-year-old lottery has run into problems because the state constitutional amendment authorizing the games requires that 45 percent of the proceeds go to the state and that no more than 10 percent go to administration. An independent audit commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the game would fail early in 1989 unless more money was offered as prizes and more money was available for administration. An amendment reflecting those recommendations will be on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> ballot later this year. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> lottery earned $ 80 million last year, far less than the $ 250 million a year some legislators had forecast. Even a successful operation such as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lottery contributes only 2.5 percent of the state's general fund budget, and there is no reason to believe that lotteries have been a substitute for tax increases. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s game began at the same time sales, personal income and corporate taxes were rising in the free-spending years of Gov. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's lottery came with a package of tax increases in 1982, when the state was hard-pressed for cash. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lottery, recalled that the lottery was promoted in 1971 as a way of avoiding a sales tax increase from 3 percent to 4 percent. In 1975, the sales tax went up to 5 percent _ part of a program by newly elected Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to eliminate a $ 600 million deficit. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s receipts are earmarked for senior citizen programs such as tax subsidies and prescription drugs. Despite projected growth of 11 percent next year, revenues were lagging behind program requirements, and Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has recommended returning some of the senior citizen programs to general funding. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> decided not to depend on lottery profits for state operations. Instead, `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Plan'' proceeds go into one-time economic development programs such as grants to new or expanding businesses. Oregon also directs its lottery profits _ $ 47.3 million last year _ to economic development. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which began its lottery last month, has a novel clause making things more difficult for unscrupulous prize winners. It provides for prizes to be awarded to dependents if the winner is a child-support deadbeat. Already, $ 70,000 has been earmarked for dependents.

 State lottery games have had few scandals, but inevitably someone is tempted to try to shorten the odds. One of the more recent scandals was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where four workers in the lottery division's mailroom were caught intercepting stubs in a `` second-chance'' and putting their own names on them. The four were fired. In 1975, all 318 lottery workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were laid off and the games were suspended after it was discovered that tickets with duplicate numbers had been printed for one drawing. The games resumed the next year. The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>'s lottery commission was indicted in 1983 for submitting false letters to a state ethics committee. The panel was investigating whether the chairman, <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> Palley </PERSON>, had a business relationship with lottery contractors or potential contractors. <PERSON> Palley </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a former official was convicted of mail fraud in 1980 along with an accomplice for rigging a game. He was found out when lottery employees noticed that the official's fiancee had won $ 21,000. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> had a loaded ping-pong ball scandal in 1980. Eight people were convicted of rigging a Daily Number drawing and winning $ 3.5 million. Greed was their undoing _ investigators said heavy betting by the conspirators gave the game away. Last month, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s `` High Card'' game suffered an embarrassing boo-boo when it was discovered that numbers could be read on a scratch-card game without having to scratch. The cards were withdrawn.

 There was no question the Danish supertanker <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Maersk </PERSON> had a gaping hole in its hull, that a crewman was dead, that the burning and crippled ship needed to be towed from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. But the question that perplexed the gulf shipping community is one that has become increasingly characteristic of the increasingly confusing Iran-Iraq war: Which nation staged the attack? `` It's confusing, and it will grow more confusing,'' said a Dubai-based shipping executive who spoke on condition of anonymity according to company rules. `` Both sides are diversifying the style of the attacks and the weapons they have been using.'' Initially, the gulf shipping community almost unanimously considered the tanker a victim of an Iranian raid on Thursday. It was a logical target for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s attacks on Iranian tankers. It also left the sort of damage characteristic of Iranian Silkworm missiles. But by Sunday, the prevailing opinion among shipping executives was that the ship was the victim of an Iraqi raid _ the latest, perhaps, in a series of errant Iraqi missile attacks. The executives said a key clue came on Friday, when an Iraqi jet bomber, a Soviet-made Badger, fired two C-601 missiles within eight miles of the destroyer USS Chandler, which was escorting a convoy of reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting the tankers last July to protect them from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which considers <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> an ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the seven-year Iran-Iraq war. The Iraqis were n't known previously to have had the C-601s, an air-to-ground version of the anti-ship Silkworms favored by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> normally uses French-built Exocet missiles. Such changing weaponry on both sides _ and the propensity for mistaken targets _ is clouding the gulf picture. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, for example, until lately has relied mainly on speedboats equipped with guns to stage its attacks. But earlier this month, a U.S.-made Phantom jet of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s made a sudden reapearance on the gulf, the first Iranian jet spotted in the region in a year and a half. Shipping executives also believe Iranians now possesses substantial numbers of <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-designed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION>, an air-to-surface missile that can cause as much damage as the missiles used by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Iranians also have equipped frigates with Italian-made Seakiller missiles, which can cause more damage to a ship's hull than cannon shells, rocket-propelled grenades or machine guns that their speedboats normally use. And they have the Silkworms, deployed at the southern and northern extremities of the gulf, but mobile and therefore effective from any point along the 600-mile gulf coast. But mistaken targets are what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers said they fear most in the gulf. Last May 17, an Iraqi missile strike killed 37 Americans aboard the USS Stark, a frigate. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the attack was a mistake, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted its apology. On Feb. 7, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officers said the battle cruiser <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> had a `` tense moment'' when the the firing and subsequent explosion of what was believed to be an Iraqi missile could be viewed from the ship. There have been other instances in which <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles fired from long range at a mere radar blip have wound up devastating ships linked to their Arab allies, such as <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also once blasted a fishing trawler. The Iranians are n't immune from mistakes. On Jan. 22, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked the Norwegian-owned Havpil as it headed toward the Iranian port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> with a shipment of refined petroleum products that were, in fact, for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. So with the weapons changing _ and not necessarily being pointed in the right direction _ the gulf shipping community has now become more cautious about determining who is shooting what, and why. `` We tend to immediately say it's an Iranian attack once a victim of the tanker war is related to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> or when the location of the attack is away from the Iranian shipping lanes, but we are growing more careful now,'' said the <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> executive.

 By ordinary <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> standards, the six Roman Catholics killed by police near the end of 1982 would not stand out among the 2,620 other people who have died during the 20-year conflict. But the six men were unarmed, and the murky circumstances of the police ambushes in which they died have left an ugly mystery that has resurfaced to batter <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s reputation for justice and fair play. Critics allege that the shootings, in three separate incidents over a three-week period, were deliberate; that the policemen who did it escaped punishment; and that a senior police officer sent in to investigate was hounded out of uniform because he got too close to the truth. The controversy was rekindled on Jan. 25 when the British government, while denying that police mounted a `` shoot-to-kill policy'' in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, admitted in a statement that there had been a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. This admission, coupled with a refusal on national security grounds to prosecute the killers, has provoked outcry in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and plunged relations between the two governments to their lowest ebb in nearly six years. In February, the investigating officer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, published his book, `` Stalker,'' a portrayal of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s unruly backyard, where the normal rules of policing and justice are routinely flouted Critics say the book reaffirms the belief that British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is unjust toward the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority, and there are worries that the affair will set back recent progress toward reconciliation, most notably the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement giving <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> a say in governing the province. On Nov. 11, 1982, three guerrilla suspects were shot dead by police as they drove through <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. A month later, two more died in similar circumstances in the same area, notorious as a hotbed of guerrilla activity. In between, a teen-ager with no guerrilla connections was killed in a <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> hayshed that served as a guerrilla explosives hideout, having apparently stumbled innocently into a police ambush. At first the police said all the deaths occurred in the normal course of anti-terrorist warfare. But subsequent evidence suggested the killings were deliberate and avoidable. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON>, chief constable of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, ordered an inquiry, and in May 1984, Stalker, the deputy chief constable of the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> police force, arrived from the mainland with a six-man investigation team. In his book, the lean, bespectacled Englishman says he was put on his guard from the outset when <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON> told him: `` Remember, Mr. <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, you are in a jungle now.'' <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON> has refused repeatedly to comment on Stalker's book. Stalker says he faced constant obstruction from a police force that resented him as an intruder, and from <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON> who, Stalker believes, was determined to protect his beleaguered force at any cost. Nonetheless, after two years of investigation he felt he had uncovered enough to suspect the killings were `` the act of a Central American assassination squad _ truly of a police force out of control.'' Stalker writes that he had evidence that at least 11 officers were involved in a conspiracy to pervert justice and commit perjury. Then, he says, `` the investigation came to an end for me like a car hitting a brick wall.'' In May 1986 he was abruptly dumped from the inquiry and suspended for `` disciplinary offenses.'' The offenses concerned his use of police vehicles and his past acquaintance with people who had minor police records. The panel that sat in judgment threw out the charges and immediately reinstated him. But he was not restored to the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> inquiry. And he does not believe the government's insistence that his suspension had nothing to do with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. On March 13, 1987, just before his 48th birthday, Stalker quit the force and began writing his book. Partially serialized in a mass-circulation <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, it has become an immediate best seller. The respected <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION> calls it `` almost a morality play. On the one side, the dark, violent and brutalized struggle between a paramilitary police force and a ruthless guerrilla organization. On the other, the honorable, relentless quest for truth by the unarmed bobbies from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>.'' Stalker's critics say he was naive to think he could march into the middle of a terrorist war and apply his English standards. Stalker responds: `` I'm a pragmatic, hard-nosed copper but I draw the line at murder.'' The Royal Ulster Constabulary has issued a statement reiterating that no `` shoot-to-kill'' policy ever existed, and saying it had no hand in Stalker's suspension. The statement denied Stalker's investigation was obstructed, and said `` there are many other matters'' in his book and statements `` which the police do not accept as being accurate.'' It did not elaborate. Stalker says he believes a high-level government decision was taken to oust him, and he says he can understand why. He says he recognizes that if his recommendations had been taken up, they would have devastated the police force at a delicate juncture in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> politics. He believes that there was no `` formal, officially endorsed shoot-to-kill policy,'' but that the constabulary, under constant attack by guerrillas, was pervaded by `` a feeling of ` let's do it to them before they do it to us.''' He also agrees with the decision not to prosecute, saying too much time has passed for a fair trial to be held. Stalker believes the problem lies in expecting policemen to be soldiers. In <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where Stalker has received a hero's welcome, he told a TV interviewer: `` It was this hypocrisy that annoyed me. If somebody had said to me, ` Mr. <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, these are soldiers fighting a war and this set of standards must apply,' then I could have taken that into account. `` But they did n't. They said: ` This investigation is to be done in the same way as you would do in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>,' and that's what I did.''

<TEXT>
 The government is going out of its way to dampen expectations for rapid change, in contrast to past years, when hints of political breakthroughs proved wrong. The pressures of unrest and sanctions are waning, white officials say, and there is time to crack down on pockets of opposition while trying to persuade blacks to accept less than majority rule. In the week since the 1988 Parliament session opened, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and his Cabinet have sought to turn the spotlight away from black grievances and focus it on a new economic program that advocates a public-sector wage freeze and privatization of state monopolies. During a string of speeches by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, scant mention was made of the persistent grass-roots struggle by blacks for political rights. Instead, there were generalized endorsements of democracy coupled with explanations that it could be extended to blacks only in a slow, circumscribed manner that would leave whites with a final say on national policy. `` Reform can not take place at the same rate as one can brew instant coffee,'' said <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, a deputy minister assigned by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to woo black leaders into negotiations. `` The capacity for people to digest change is limited.'' Compared with the hardline apartheid rhetoric of a decade ago, the current talk of sharing power with blacks borders on the revolutionary. But the government also has clarified its non-negotiable bottom line _ continuation of segregated schools, hospitals and living areas, and a political system in which whites could never be dominated by blacks. The nation's blacks number 26 million and their population growth rate is nearly triple that of the 5 million whites. `` The -LRB- political -RRB- model we will develop is not intended to seek the approval of the outside world,'' said one government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We ca n't have a political dispensation based simply on majority rule.'' Anti-apartheid activists already have dismissed as inadequate one of the few pending pieces of reform legislation _ a proposal to allow communities the option of integrating, subject to approval by residents and the government. Most of the official talk about reform is now presented in terms of the new economic program, which proponents say will free large sums of capital for projects benefiting blacks. `` Reform Costs Money'' has become an unofficial government slogan, with the implication that economic progress must precede a major political shift. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in full-page newspaper advertisements Sunday, called on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to `` tighten our belts'' to build the economic foundation for social and political change. But <PERSON> Sampie </PERSON> <PERSON> Terreblanche </PERSON>, a leading economist who last year quit <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, suggested in a column in the nationally circulated Sunday Times that the economy was being stressed `` to detract attention from the tragic failure of the government's political reform. Extreme-right politicians have condemned the economic plan as a disguised attempt to redistribute wealth from whites to blacks. The government's new approach contrasts with periods in the past three years when at least some officials indicated dramatic political moves were imminent. There were suggestions that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, jailed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, might be freed and that the government might negotiate with the outlawed guerrilla movement. Particularly embarrassing was <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s highly promoted 1985 speech in which he said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was `` crossing the Rubicon'' away from apartheid, then disappointed people who expected specific, momentous concessions. Now government officials believe the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military strength is waning and claim to have triumphed over the international sanctions campaign. The white liberal opposition is in disarray and anti-government unrest in black townships is down sharply after 20 months of state-of-emergency detentions and security force patrols. There is breathing space, the government believes, to concentrate on long-term plans and confront the challenge by the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in three upcoming parliamentary by-elections. <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, minister for black education and development, told foreign journalists that the best way to counter the far-right threat is to promote orderly, effective reform. But the government also is preparing an array of tough moves against its political foes on the left _ moves which could boost its standing on the right. The targets include: _ Militant black trade unions. Pending legislation would make it harder for unions to stage legal strikes and easier for employers to fire strikers. _ Universities. State subsidies are being sharply reduced this year, and further cuts are threatened unless university officials crack down on anti-government campus protests. _ The press. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> defended regulations that have subjected anti-government newspapers to threat of closure, and he criticized mainstream English-language papers for a `` venomous vendetta'' against his censorship rules. _ Anti-apartheid organizations. Officials indicate that legislation is being drafted that would prohibit the receipt of foreign funds by certain anti-government groups, a move that could devastate those whose supporters within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are mostly poor. `` If one gets large amounts of money which is channeled from overseas into the South African political process, then one gets too many foreign shareholders,'' said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>. `` If people want to be active on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> political front, they must do so with money they raise in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Delaying Puberty With Exercise May Prevent Breast Cancer</HEAD>

 Girls should be encouraged to exercise vigorously enough to delay their puberty, because this may help protect them from breast cancer and other diseases later in life, a researcher says. Grade school girls who play strenuous sports often have their first menstrual period, or menarche, later than usual. Even after adolescence starts, they may miss periods if they work out regularly. Although delayed or missing menstruation is often thought to be abnormal, some experts now say that it is natural and even desirable, because it may protect the body from the damaging effects of sex hormones. American girls have been going through puberty at increasingly early ages throughout this century. Dr. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that typically American girls now have their first period at age 12 -LCB-. But if they exercise in such vigorous sports as tennis, running, basketball or soccer, their average age at menarche is 15 -LCB-, the same as it was 100 years ago. And <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> said a simple rule seems to apply: The more menstrual cycles a woman has over her lifetime, the greater her chance of breast cancer, the biggest cancer killer among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women. So anything that delays the start of menstruation should lower the cancer risk. `` I suggest that regular exercise starting early in elementary school would have a long-term spin-off in reduced risk of breast cancer and, from our data, a reduced risk of diabetes and cancer of the reproductive system,'' <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> said. She and other experts who study the effects of exercise on reproduction presented their work at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Recent federal statistics suggest that the risk of dying from breast cancer may actually be increasing. Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said breast cancer may take 40 years to develop. `` What you do in puberty can be very relevant to what happens in breast cancer after menopause,'' he said. <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> based her recommendation, in part, on a study she conducted on 5,398 women who graduated from 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges. She found that those who had been athletic in college and high school had only about half as much cancer of the breast and reproductive system later in life as those did n't get regular exercise. Those who have delayed or irregular periods during their teen-age years seem to suffer no long-term problems. <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>'s study found that athletic women had just as many children as those who were less active. Dr. <PERSON> Tenley </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> surgeon who was an Olympic skating champion, said coaches and parents often consider delayed or missing periods to be a disorder, while young athletes often do not. She said the condition should be thought of as an `` appropriate adaptive response'' by the body, not a defect. The relationship between exercise and fertility is complex. Experts believe that very lean and muscular women sometimes can not get pregnant because their bodies do not have enough fat to nourish a growing fetus. They must slow down their exercise and put on some weight to become fertile. Studies have also found that lean women make more of a non-potent kind of estrogen than do fatter women. Estrogen is a key sex hormone that is essential for fertility but also plays a role in cancer of the breast and reproductive system. Experts suggest that even though lean women may be fertile, they produce less active estrogen. And this may reduce the growth of cells in their breast and reproductive tissues. When these cells proliferate less, there is also less chance of a cell dividing abnormally and starting a tumor. Some researchers also believe that among men, extreme exercise can diminish the production of male sex hormones and might interfere with sperm production. However, the effects of exercise on male fertility appears to be much less dramatic in men than in women.

 Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest-ruling head of state, won an eighth consecutive term as president by a landslide Sunday. Opposition leaders said the balloting was rigged. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON>, head of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the party's list of candidates led by the 75-year-old president won 982,316, or 89 percent of the ballots counted. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> has ruled the nation of 3.8 million people since taking power in an army coup in 1954. The <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose candidate was Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, received 78,141 votes, or 7 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by candidate Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> Ybarra </PERSON>, was third with 32,403 votes, or 3 percent. A total of 1,445,822 voters in this landlocked country were registered to participate in Sunday's national elections to pick a president, 36 Senators and 72 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. No one doubted that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> would win. The overwhelming majority of registered voters belong to his party and he won the last elections in 1983 with 90.06 percent of the vote. Opposition leaders had urged voters to cast blank votes in protest. Both <PERSON> Ybarra </PERSON>, 54, and <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 65, acknowledged beforehand that they had no chance of winning. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it was suspending its unofficial count for the night. The official <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was expected to release final vote tabulations Monday. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, election overseer at a polling place in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s law school in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, said voting was peaceful. `` Everything went normally,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said shortly before the polls closed at 6 p.m., 11 hours after opening. Fifty official and unofficial observers from 12 countries monitored the voting. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, complained to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> that a car in which he and opposition politicians were riding was stopped in <LOCATION> Ypacarai </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, by a group of men in plainclothes and police uniforms. `` We were mistreated without provocation and treated in a beastly fashion,'' said <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>. He said the car's driver, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Perreira </PERSON>, leader of a dissident faction of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was struck several times. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Greisgaber </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consultant for the institute, said she and a group of Uruguayan observers witnessed several election violations in the Col. <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION> area, including voting by underage voters. `` We also were told the area cotton farmers had been advised that cotton prices would not be increased if they did not vote or that they would not be able to sell their crops,'' she said. In Col. <PERSON> Oviedo </PERSON>, farmer <PERSON> Froilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was voting `` because we have a government that says you ca n't work if you do n't vote. The small center-left <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged voters to abstain or to cast blank ballots to protest what it said would be a fraudulent election. The party winning the largest percentage of votes gets two-thirds of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The rest are divided according to the percentage won by other parties. About 100 voters applauded when the president dropped his sealed ballot in a wooden box at a polling station in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>'s middle-class <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> neighborhood He pointed to the box and said, `` This is democracy.'' In <LOCATION> Caaguazu </LOCATION>, 110 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, about 100 people at a Roman Catholic church chanted anti-government slogans and denounced the detention of <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, the country's leading opposition spokesman, was placed under house arrest Thursday for 24 hours in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>.

 A new CBS-TV series looking for laughs in two languages will be the first prime-time network show produced with both English and Spanish soundtracks, a production spokesman says. `` Trial and Error,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> midseason replacement sitcom about a Hispanic odd couple, is scheduled to debut March 15 with a Spanish radio simulcast to the nation's six top Hispanic markets. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials are contacting radio stations in target cities and testing sound delivery, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMesquita </PERSON> said Thursday. If it works, viewers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, will be able to listen in English or Spanish. `` CBS will feed to its affiliates the episodes of ` Trial and Error.' They would feed the second language, Spanish, on an audio channel,'' <PERSON> DeMesquita </PERSON> said. `` Then the local <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate would feed the second audio channel to a participating radio station over a telephone line.'' `` Hispanic homes would be able to turn down the volume on their TV and turn up the volume on the radio and watch the program in Spanish,'' <PERSON> DeMesquita </PERSON> said. CBS has contracted for seven episodes of the program, which stars <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> as a young lawyer and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> as a T-shirt vendor. While geared for a mainstream audience, the jokes and dialogue were written with an awareness they would also air in Spanish. The show revolves around <PERSON> Velez </PERSON>'s position as the only Hispanic lawyer in a prestigious <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> law firm and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s steady wheeling and dealing to sell more shirts. The bilingual plans mark the first time an English-language network program has been produced with a Spanish-speaking Hispanic audience in mind, <PERSON> DeMesquita </PERSON> said. DeMesquita hopes <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> eventually sends the Spanish soundtrack to all affiliates so stations elsewhere can arrange simulcasts. But network officials want to see if the bilingual broadcasts work in the test markets before making a broader commitment to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>. `` It's something the studio brought to us.

 Mathematics, theoretical physics and oceanography are among the fields in which American scientists are likely to learn much from their <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> colleagues during upcoming exchanges, according to a delegation of Soviet scientists. The Soviet researchers were in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Sunday to describe current Soviet research at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Seven administrators from the most prestigious Soviet science institutes answered a wide range of questions from reporters in a rare meeting with the press Saturday. The researchers seemed relaxed, and they answered questions without hesitation, including difficult questions on Soviet development of a Star Wars defense system. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does not intend to develop a system like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is working on,'' said <PERSON> Andrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. A few moments later, when another Soviet researcher demonstrated a flashlight-sized laser pointer of the type used by speakers to call attention to details on projected slides, <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON> elicited laughter when he said, `` This is our SDI -LRB- Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB-.'' Asked about development of chemical lasers, which might be used in a missile defense system, <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON> said, `` They are not very promising, I would say.'' On Jan. 12, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Guriy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, signed a five-year agreement providing for scientific exchanges and cooperation. Under the terms of that agreement, joint scientific workshops will be held during the next two years on such topics as vaccine development, earthquake prediction, planetary science, biotechnology and astrophysics. <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, said that mathematics, theoretical physics and laser and semiconductor technology are some of the traditional strongholds of Soviet science. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has developed a number of sophisticated scientific instruments,'' he said, speaking through a translator. Computer software useful in oceanography has also been developed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said. In the upcoming scientific exchanges, he said, `` these are areas where the Soviet side could bring something to the table.'' He proposed that joint ventures be established to develop computer manufacture. `` There was quite a gap in the introduction of computers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, particularly personal computers,'' he said. <PERSON> Yuriy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossipyan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, said that Soviet scientists had developed a new description of the interaction of materials in certain high-temperature superconductors. He said that research on superconductivity is being actively pursued at his institute and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a presentation Sunday, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>, said that the Soviet union has built industrial plants for the production of animal feed through yeast fermentation. Bacteria are being used to leach metals from poor quality ores, to decrease potentially dangerous levels of methane gas in coal mines and to enhance oil recovery, <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeev </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> described the planned launch in July of a spacecraft to study the Martian moon Phobos, which may be an asteroid that got trapped in orbit around <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>.

They're busy and they do n't have time to go to things,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday `` It's hard to find someone when you're on the farm.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who runs a 1,000-acre dairy, hog, corn and soybean farm in <LOCATION> Baraboo </LOCATION>, is vice president of Singles in Agriculture. The group, which has members in just about every state and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, schedules outings such as a campout in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> or a boat trip in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dells </LOCATION> and keeps a list of singles with rural backgrounds. It does not emphasize making matches or pushing people to the altar, but some of its members have married each other, said <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON>, 49, the group's president. She met <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON>, a 53-year-old beef cattle and grain farmer from <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, through the group, and they were married last June. After the death of her first husband on the couple's <LOCATION> Staceyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, farm in 1979, Mrs. <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON> said she was like many farm widows who find themselves in a small, rural town without many single people their age Most of her friends were still married. They invited her to dinner or dances but Mrs. <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON> said she felt like `` the odd one out.'' She helped start Singles in Agriculture when 23 farmers who had written to one another through a farm magazine gathered in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, in June 1986. The group's members must be either be working in agriculture or have farmed in the past or have grown up on a farm. It includes farmers who lost their farms during tough financial times and now have other jobs, as well as secretaries who grew up on farms, Mrs. <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON> said. Besides the time constraints to dating, farmers need people who understand rural life in order for a relationship to work, she said. `` I think the -LRB- agriculture -RRB- person needs someone who is more willing to give than anyone can imagine,'' she said. `` You can have a date all set and if something happens with the livestock or the weather changes, you have to cancel it.'' A forecast of rain may mean staying home to bale hay instead of going to a movie, she said. The group's members range from the early 20s to 77, Mrs. <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON> said. Most are from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ but there are members in several other states, she said. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roette </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, said she believes it may be more difficult for young people on the farm to meet other single young people these days. `` Years back there were more country get-togethers. Now it's rare,'' she said `` The gals go in the big cities to work and they do n't want to come back to live and work on the farm,'' she said. `` Our main goal in setting this up,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gahm </PERSON> said, `` is to have people meet someone they have something in common with so that when they're lonely they can pick up a phone and call or write a letter.''

 Talk show host <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, whose battle with her waistline is waged on national television, admits she's addicted to food `` Eating is a drug for me,'' she said in an interview published in the March issue of Ladies' Home Journal. `` It's what I do when I'm really happy, and it's what I do when I'm tired. It's what I do when I'm not sure if I'm happy or tired. It is a disease.'' Her favorite food? `` Potatoes. Fried potatoes, baked potatoes, any kind of potatoes,'' she said. `` I could go through my life and never eat a sweet thing. It's mostly potatoes, pasta, breads, fried things, and also that I just eat so much and add butter to everything.'' She said she remembers thinner days. `` I still have my <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> size-10 jeans hanging in my closet,'' she said. `` The last time I wore them was 1982, but I still hold on to them, saying, ` Well, one day. ...'

<HEAD>Europeans Back Treaty but Still Look to US For Defense</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Many West Europeans feel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did little to protect their interests at the summit last December, but most believe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would keep its pledge to defend them, according to a survey sponsored by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The survey, conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also found that most West Europeans support the treaty signed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit to remove <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, the agency did not repeat a question from a similar poll reported last June, which yielded results embarrassing to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. That poll showed that a huge majority of West Europeans gave credit for the treaty to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rather than to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The Senate has been conducting hearings leading up to a vote on whether to ratify the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. The new poll found overwhelming European support for the treaty, ranging from 97 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to 78 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, with most registering `` strong support'' _ 65 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 79 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 76 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 77 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most of those polled believe that, if the treaty is ratified and the missiles removed, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will remain `` committed to the defense of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and `` will do whatever is necessary'' to defend their countries. Fifty-nine percent felt that way in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 61 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 67 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 57 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 56 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Belgians were divided, 46 percent agreeing and 44 percent disagreeing. But many also said they believe the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did little to protect West European interests at the summit. Asked how well they thought their country's interests were protected at the summer, 17 percent of the Belgians said they thought they were protected `` a great deal'' or `` a fair amount,'' the response given by 16 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 28 percent in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 40 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 34 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 31 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Those answering `` not very much'' or `` not at all'' were 68 percent in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 61 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 65 percent in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 40 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 55 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 56 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A sizable minority of West Europeans polled believe the treaty makes them more vulnerable to Soviet attack: 29 percent in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 26 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 33 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 24 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 34 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, and 16 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Majorities or pluralities in all six countries said the Soviets signed the treaty, in part, because <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decided in 1979 to deploy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to counter Soviet SS-20's. Responding that way were 45 percent in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 51 percent in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 46 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 72 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 63 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 50 percent in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Similar percentages believe that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should halt the withdrawal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles if the Soviets are found to be cheating: 67 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 65 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 50 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 55 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 59 percent in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Belgians were again divided, with 41 percent favoring a halt and 45 percent continued withdrawal. Majorities ranging from 78 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to 94 percent in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> described U.S.-Soviet relations as good or very good. The survey was based on telephone interviews with about 500 citizens in each of the countries Dec. 14-16, immediately after the summit at which the INF pact was signed. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained an agency report on the latest survey last week. The agency analysis of the report did not provide a breakdown of those answering all the questions, but instead drew conclusions from the data and published some results. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has polled West European public opinion since shortly after World War II, and the results are circulated to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and overseas to guide them in relations with foreign nations. The agency tries to promote the image of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abroad and advance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> views through programs such as the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio system and the Worldnet television satellite system. The margin of error for results of the December poll was plus or minus 5 percentage points, Agency polls are conducted by independent companies within each country.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, sitting pretty just 10 days ago as <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> voters finally turned their attention to presidential politics, are suddenly facing feast or famine in the state's snow-packed primary. And they are n't alone. For <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and maybe even <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, Tuesday's elections shape up as a do-or-die test of their ability to stay alive in the 1988 presidential campaign. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> has within its grasp the power of life or death over my candidacy,'' said <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who fashions himself the last honest man among the dirty dozen who have outlasted <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> on the campaign trail. The tension is highest among the Republicans, where the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution may ride on the coattails of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in their race against <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>. For just as surely as 12-year-old <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> carried the torch to begin the XV Winter Olympics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> carry the torch for the silent, retiring fellow who'll be sitting by the fire in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who held a huge lead in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> polls until he lost <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in such embarrassing fashion, wrapped himself in the presidency throughout Sunday night's debate. At one point he went so far as to defend the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>! _ to punctuate the extent to which he hopes voters will put their trust in Reaganism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must win _ that is, come in first _ Tuesday or hope <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will drop his neutrality and ride to his rescue. It is n't as if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't got a chance. The weekend polls show him in a first-place duel with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and he benefits from new, lower expectations which have him fading away to his seaside home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, Me. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, vowing to `` complete the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution,'' worked over the weekend to impress <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters with his pledge not to raise taxes, no matter what. At one point during the day he said, `` I am convinced that Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a secret plan to raise taxes on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> can kick around <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> all he likes but the <LOCATION> Dole-Bush </LOCATION> struggle is irrelevant, for now, to his bid for survival. He enjoyed strong poll figures on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> eve, but his standing as conservative challenger to the front-runners is now being blocked by the emergence of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Sunday he'll beat <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> because `` the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> want a conservative who can reach out beyond just one segment of the population and win.'' Forgotten for the moment is du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who hopes to sneak up on everyone Tuesday and live to fight another day. So far he has amassed respect but not much support. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> beats <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> beats <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the topsy turvy <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign will be topsy again. It's a little known secret, but the other party, the Democrats, are also holding a presidential primary Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has to win big and he probably will, getting an honorable boost as it occurs to people that he handled the spotlight nicely and knows the issues better than his Washington-based opponents like to let on. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor already has set up shop in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> -LRB- caucuses a week from tomorrow -RRB- _ keenly aware that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> primaries give him a spearhead on Super Tuesday -LRB- 20 states, March 8 -RRB- that none of his opponents can easily match. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is slugging it out for second place with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. It's remarkable that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is still in the hunt after half-a-dozen or so lackluster debates, but he touches a tender nerve among party liberals and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has had trouble answering some of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s negative ads which imply he is n't trustworthy If the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman becomes ensnarled in the inconsistencies of his voting record, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will surely keep chipping away as the voting shifts South. `` I hope to do much better than people expect on Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said during a strong anti-Gephardt performance over the weekend. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> trailed the pack in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last week and are expected to spend their last dollar in futility. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> has waged a human-scale campaign of humor and candor. But as du Pont can tell him, you ca n't spend respect _ the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor is running out of money. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> is threatening to go the distance, no matter how pathetic his results may be. But he already has an uncontrollable campaign debt from 1984 and it's hard to see who'll extend him credit for the 48 states to come.

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Gene Essential To Biological Clocks</HEAD>

 Researchers have identified a gene in fruit flies that is essential to the working of the biological clock that governs a wide range of bodily processes in humans and animals. The gene is associated with the generation or maintenance of the daily, or circadian, rhythms that presumably evolved to help animals and humans cope with night and day, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON>, a biologist at <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. He spoke Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In addition to controlling the length, or period, of the daily cycle, the gene _ called the period gene _ also governs minute-long fluctuations in the courtship song of the fruit fly, <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. The gene is involved not only in the length of the rhythms but also seems to carry instructions regarding such things as the extent of activity during active periods of the cycle, <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. Circadian rhythms are a pervasive feature of human and animal life. They govern fundamental measures such as body temperature and hormonal secretions, and many other more subtle physical and mental factors. Researchers do not yet know how the period gene works. That question is being studied intensively by <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and their colleagues at <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION>, and by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and associates at <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said the period gene presumably triggers the production of a protein. That protein might be part of the clock mechanism, something that researchers know nothing about. Or it could be the read-out of the clock, something like the hands on a wristwatch, which give you the information that was generated in the clock mechanism, <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. A third possibility is that the period gene protein somehow controls the genes or proteins that form the clock mechanism, turning them on or off, for example. The two research teams are now working intensively to isolate the protein produced by the period gene and determine its function, <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. Among the curious features of the gene that they have identified is a string of 25 pairs of coding units in the gene's genetic message, which encodes proteins. This feature is highly unusual, but it occurs in only one of three species of fruit flies tested. And when it is removed, the gene appears to function well without it. `` The perfect repeat of 25 pairs appears not to be necessary,'' <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. When the entire gene is removed from a fruit fly, the fly loses its circadian rhythms, but it is otherwise perfectly normal, he said. Certain mutants of the period gene give flies a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours, <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. Those genes also reduce the 60-second cycling in the males fruit fly's courtship song, <PERSON> Rosbash </PERSON> said. He has also found that the gene appears to be turned on in fruit fly embryos and adults, but not in the larval or pupal stages in the fly's life cycle that occur in between.

 Republican presidential candidates, their prospects riding on the decision of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary voters, head into a final day of campaigning after a debate in which the also-rans pounced on the front-runner in an 11th-hour effort to change the odds. `` Sign it,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as the former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> governor thrust a no-tax pledge in his face at one point in the Sunday night debate. `` I'd have to read it first,'' snapped <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, reviving an old dispute over the INF treaty with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Maybe <PERSON> George </PERSON> would sign it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the target of jabs from <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont on arms control and prospects for Soviet withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Taking advantage of their last opportunity to impress voters before the polls open on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders were spending the day at coffee shops, shopping malls and service club meetings. The latest polls indicated a Bush-Dole fight for first place in the Republican primary and du Pont, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and former evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> fighting for third place. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released Sunday night said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had the support of 31 percent of likely Republican voters, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was backed by 28 percent. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was the choice of 13 percent and du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of 11 percent each. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> survey had it <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 30; <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 11; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and du Pont, 10 each. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he expected the Soviets to go forward with a promised troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said heatedly, `` We have a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that has run amok on this issue.'' `` Wait and see,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Do n't fight progress when you see it. Do n't be afraid.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to close out the argument, saying, `` I do n't jump away from the president when the going gets tough'' and then added, `` Give peace a chance'' which brought another outburst from <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` You should be embarrassed to use give peace a chance,'' he said. `` We're the party of peace.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> appeared in the press room to say Republicans should be saying `` give freedom a chance.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the debate showed `` we're looking at the Old Guard of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> versus the future of a party devoted to hope, opportunity and freedom.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> also appeared in the press room to press his contention that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would opt for a tax increase to deal with the budget deficit. `` We gave <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> a chance to take the tax pledge,'' he said. The vice president made it clear he was n't giving up no matter what happens on Tuesday. `` Here I stand warts and all,'' he said recalling the words of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. He said he's not the best of orators, but added, `` Do n't take that for a lack of passion.'' `` My work is n't done yet,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> appeared to startle his fellow debaters when he said the Soviets have placed missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He said his source was the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. `` Somehow in all this brilliant negotiation which these gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` And it seems like to me nukes pointing at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are more vital to our security than nukes pointing to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said the candidate was referring to missile delivery systems, not warheads. He said the information did not come directly from the Foreign Relations committee `` but that's where some of the information was compiled.'' He refused to name the source of the information. On AIDS, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> questioned the value of routine testing for the disease. `` Let's say you test false positive and the word gets out you have the AIDS virus and you do n't have it,'' he said. `` We've got people who are suffering. This is one issue we should n't politicize. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> immediately jumped in to say, `` We need routine testing.''

<HEAD>Florida Ready To Resume Shipments But Texas, California Object</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 State and federal officials are fighting efforts by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to keep out <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus fruit after the lifting of a federal ban imposed to keep a plant disease from spreading to other states. The issue is canker, a bacterial disease with the potential to seriously cripple an entire industry. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has been battling a mild form of nursery canker for three years. Industry leaders and scientists recently succeeded in convincing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> it was not a threat to fruit or trees in commercial groves. Officials had initially feared the disease was the virulent Asiatic canker. After months of state and federal research and deliberation, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> last week lifted its 3-year-old ban prohibiting shipments of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fresh fruit to other citrus-growing states. Relaxation of the ban means the reopening of markets valued at $ 25 million a year, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> are the biggest producers outside of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> also are affected. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> growers immediately imposed their own embargo to keep <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit out for at least 30 days while they seek to overturn the federal order. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to turn back any <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit at state borders. `` Exporting <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s misery to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is not going to be the answer,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> agriculture commissioner. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s reaction was more restrained. But there was talk of legal action, and an official for <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had not followed proper procedures for public hearings and notification to the concerned states. `` Everyone must go through the legal hoops, and we're not sure they jumped through all the hoops,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> trade association's grower services. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pointed out that it had held hearings in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last October on its proposal to lift the ban. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said she did n't believe the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> embargo would be legally enforceable since it would preempt a federal order. Growers gearing up for a resumption of shipments are struggling with a variety of federal rules designed to ensure that no contaminated fruit leaves the state. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, who has fruit packing houses in Winter Haven and <LOCATION> Haines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, expects to be one of the first to begin shipping truckloads of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tangerines to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But he and other shippers and growers have to undergo rigorous inspections by federal agents. Inspectors walk the groves with owners and obtain compliance agreements before fruit is certified for shipment. Fruit can only be taken from inspected groves, and must be treated with a bactericide and waxed to remove any surface contamination. Growers have to attest that all harvesters and shipping vehicles are free of canker. The rigid requirements mean it will be a week to 10 days before shipments begin, said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McKown </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 12,000 growers. The joint state-federal canker eradication project burned some 20 million trees, mostly seedlings and nursery stock. Recent state court rulings raised the prospect that the state may have to pay as much as $ 200 million to nursery owners who received only $ 17.4 million as partial compensation for their trees. Scientists now say the nursery strain of canker primarily produces mild spotting of fruit and leaves, adding that neither affects the quality of the fruit or juice and canker does not harm people. The Asiatic strain, which can weaken trees and cause fruit and leaf damage, was discovered in 1986 in a small <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> area of mature groves, which was immediately quarantined. A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> order prohibits shipment of fresh fruit from that region.

<HEAD>High-Tech Hideaway Is Natural Habitat For Pilot-Turned-Senator</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, spends his days in solitude with his computer and his headset, working in a `` hideaway'' office where he feels like he's back in a DC-9 cockpit. Seventy-nine members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are assigned to the existing 79 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hideaways, little second offices where they are supposed to be able to reflect, away from the relentless demands of their time. But, unlike most senators, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has turned his public, spacious office in the modern <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> office building over to his staffers and turned his one-man Capitol hideaway into a full-time, high-tech command center. There, he sits alone, communicating with his staff all day by electronic message, convinced he is `` pushing ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> inertia.'' The circular room looks and feels like a cockpit, as <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot, punches up computer displays, talks through his headset, and fiddles with the dials on his radio. Back at the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> building, every staffer sits at a computer terminal. There are no secretaries, no typewriters, and no paper except for computer printouts. Soft computer beeps announce an incoming message. The staff calls the office the `` 3C'' center, military jargon for command, control and communications. `` I love this stuff,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> says, as he sits at the computer controls. `` I find the detachment very useful. There is n't enough time to think and read around this place.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> says there are parallels between his office and a cockpit. `` I've got everything at my fingertips,'' he says. `` You reach for dials in front of you, and reach things above your head.'' When the television set and radio are off, `` there's only the sound of rushing air from the air conditioner. That's similar to the sound of a jet cockpit.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> boasts that his office is a wonderful time-saver, calculating it takes nearly 15 minutes for a round-trip between the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> building and the Capitol for a vote. Now, he's only a minute or two from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber. The hideaway, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> insists, is not a place where he hides from his staff and constituents. Staffers `` see me when they need to see me,'' he says. Any constituent desiring to see him is escorted to the hideaway. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, the senator's former legal counsel who is now in private practice, says the system fits <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s personality as `` a very disciplined person.'' `` Here's somebody who was an airline pilot who was elected to his first office as a senator,'' Fountain says. `` He's not a back-slapper. He's not a B.S. artist. Most of the other senators had long years in public life. He does not have the typical political personality that finds him operating surrounded by staff. `` He's a loner in the sense that he's somebody who has not been compromised by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifestyle, where you go to big receptions, parties and black-tie dinners. He does n't care about his standing vis-a-vis the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> club.'' It's time for <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> to check his phone messages. `` Strongly oppose Contras,'' one message says. `` Will names be turned over to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>? `` <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s staffers also have learned to make maximum use of the computer, punching in `` fashion notes'' about each other's clothes, `` wheels up'' invitations for after-work drinks, and contributing to an electronic suggestion box. `` Will the person who brings in sandwiches neatly wrapped in wax paper please eat them,'' says one message. `` Today we had to dispose of seven petrified sandwiches in seven individual greasy brown lunch bags.'' Although current <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> employees just chuckle when asked about it, former staffer <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> says when one staffer wanted to razz another, he or she would send `` the electronic finger.'' That was a computer drawing of a hand, with an obscene gesture. It started out as a small hand. `` Some of us tried to outdo that with bigger ones,'' Fountain recalls. `` No one ever sent it to the senator.'' `` We pride ourselves in taking technology to the limit,'' says administrative assistant <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, who would n't talk about the finger. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> is n't all business, either. When he cleaned out items from his home, he gave them away through the computer: a sofa, calculators, tape recorders, and even old cars. `` It seems more unusual from the outside,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a former special assistant now working for Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s presidential campaign `` People have the perception he's sitting in a black hole with no interaction with his people.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> looks at one of the monitors. It reminds him to take his allergy shots and his vitamins. `` Do you want to talk to the staff about the system?'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> asks at the end of the interview. A reporter agreed, and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> tried to telephone his press secretary. No answer. `` This is the problem when you rely on the phones,'' says <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who quickly sent a computer message that brought a fast response.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers will be offered classes in futures and options trading this year in a government experiment to see if profits on the commodities markets can reduce farm subsidies. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered the test project for 40 counties as part of the 1985 farm bill in an effort to find an alternative to expensive price supports. `` Many people are frustrated with the high cost of the current program, farmers included,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, D-Ill., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We need to have some sort of mechanism to help farmers,'' he said. `` But I think it has to fundamentally change. If it does, it will be good for the taxpayers, better for family-sized farmers and a better system, generally, for our whole country.'' A provision of the farm bill requires the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to try to teach farmers how to use the markets to hedge against risk and boost their income. The agency is to report back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the results by December 1988. The goal is to reduce the amount farmers receive in federal support by whatever they make through commodities trading, in effect transferring part of their subsidy from the government to the private sector, <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> said recently. `` It could be the forerunner of a fancy new program, or it could flop,'' <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know, and wo n't until it's tested. Farmers will be invited to take classes explaining how to buy and sell their commodities _ wheat, feed grains, soybeans and cotton _ and will receive counseling as they make pre-harvest contracts to ensure a set price for the crops. `` If market prices go up, you benefit because you lost on the futures but gained on your crop,'' he said. `` If market prices go down, you make money on your contract.'' Farmers have dabbled in commodities trading for years, but the business is complex and the practice is far from widespread among producers, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, director of analysis for the <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` All farmers would be better off if they knew how to trade on the futures and options markets,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said recently. `` Over time, they can make more money if they understand it. `` But all of this I preface by saying you better know what you're doing and do n't try to get fancy unless you want to lose your shirt.'' To ease concerns about losses and encourage participation, he said farmers enrolled in the pilot program will be guaranteed a net return equal to the local loan rate for their crops. Details remain sketchy, but he said <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> is expected to announce final guidelines for the program by March 15. An advisory committee selected 40 counties in 22 states for participation, basing its recommendations in large part on requests from farmers. `` It was n't hard to pick 40,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` It was hard to decide which of the 3,000 counties were not included.'' One of the requests came from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, who raises corn, soybeans and hogs on the farm his family has owned for 100 years near <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` I've hedged some on the futures market, but the options I have trouble with. That's why I'd like to do this and learn more,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` If you're very acquainted with farming, you know it's just like going to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>: I throw my money out every spring and hope something comes up,'' he said. `` Hopefully, we can cut down our risk a little bit by doing this.'' <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> each ended up with four counties in the project, while <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> have two each. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> each have one.

 Residents here speak with awe about the changes facing this town, with its empty houses and idle plants, when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> breaks ground this week for a $ 140 million home port for the battleship <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Naval Station Ingleside, won in a bidding competition among Gulf Coast communities from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, is welcomed locally as a boost for a region that has endured hard times in the oil and shrimping industries. Still, in a town with 5,000 people and one traffic light, there is a touch of fear in the voices of residents who know their lives may be changed forever by the thousands of people and millions in revenues the port is expected to attract by its scheduled completion in 1991. Besides the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the port will be home to the training carrier <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and three other ships. `` I do n't know if you can prepare yourself for that kind of change,'' said <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, manager of this town just north of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know if you can visualize the change and looking out and seeing the ships on the horizon.'' Direct economic effects from the port will include a $ 155 million payroll for military personnel, $ 47 million in ship repair and $ 100 million in local procurement by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for the 482-acre project, according to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> estimates. In addition, local economies will enjoy an infusion of $ 300 million from a boom in real estate, services and other indirect effects of the station, said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` You'll have a good tax base, new housing, new shopping centers,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` In the meantime, it's going to be you pedal very fast and you do n't fall over.'' Local officials are concerned that the speed and breadth of the project will overwhelm city services like water and sewage treatment in a town with an annual budget of $ 2.5 million and 42 people on its payroll. Although real estate growth eventually will drive up the property tax base and fill up vacancies resulting primarily from a decline in oil-rig manufacturing, the town has to accommodate a rapidly growing population before that money starts flowing in. `` I've been worried for quite a while,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Culver </PERSON>. `` That does n't mean we're going to throw up our hands and quit. I'm concerned about expanding our police department I'm concerned about infrastructure extensions. I'm concerned about whether our city hall is big enough.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which chose the <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> site in part because of the deep channel in its port area, estimates that the base will employ 4,665 military personnel and 574 civilians. An additional 3,200 off-base civilian jobs also are projected. At least 500 construction jobs at the naval station will be created this year, reaching a peak of 1,000 in 1990, <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON> said. Overall, as many as 18,000 new people are projected to live in the area after the base is fully operational in 1991, including those involved in non-military businesses that will serve the new military and civilian workforce and its dependents. Already two commercial developments totaling more than $ 150 million in value have begun in <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION>. `` What it will do is take us off of being oil and gas dependent,'' the mayor said. `` It's going to be a big boon to <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> if it's handled properly.'' One fear, however, is that the area will find itself filled with more unemployed construction workers than there are jobs available. Others worry that the area's tranquility will be destroyed, <PERSON> Culver </PERSON> said. `` There are a lot of people in <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> who moved over here because it's quiet, it's a bedroom community,'' he said. `` They're worried about strip joints, you know There's a lot of things that come into people's minds when they think of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> town.''

 A new study from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says explosive population growth in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is putting tremendous strains on primary schools that spend only $ 48 a year per pupil. The 39 countries in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> face the need to expand schools that can teach 51 million children to take care of nearly 91 million by the year 2000. The resources available have been stretched thinner as the population soared. Per pupil spending, after discounting for inflation, fell from $ 67 a year in 1970 to $ 48 in 1983, the report said. In many countries people's average incomes also are declining. In four countries _ <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ the number of youngsters registering for school actually went down even as population figures raced ahead. Overall, one child in four in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is not enrolled in school at all, and the ranks are growing. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, spending on elementary and secondary schools averages more than $ 4,000 per pupil each year. The schools spend almost as much on each student in two class days as these African countries spend in an entire year. The bank is the biggest single source of aid to help Third World countries raise their living standards. Its report says donors should get together and help more. A child reaching school age in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, at the northeastern tip of the continent, had about one chance in six of finding a teacher in 1983. The number of high school students there has risen, but in 1983 there were still only about 63,000 in a population of 5 or 6 million. The report says, `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s explosive population growth greatly increases the number of children seeking access to schools and increases the number of potential illiterates. `` The stock of human capital in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will determine whether <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> can harness the universal explosion of scientific and technical knowledge for the region's benefit _ or whether <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will fall farther and farther behind the world's industrial nations.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moock </PERSON>, who led the team that compiled the study, said in an interview that <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> is an extreme case. According to the report, fewer than 12 percent of adult Somalis could read in 1983. Primary school teachers were paid $ 985 a year. The government was spending about 6 percent of its budget on education _ less than $ 21 million _ and that share had been dropping for years. By comparison, it spent $ 114 million for its military, a figure that rose to $ 134 million in 1985. Across <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the number of students of all ages quintupled between 1960 and 1983. The report said that in 19 of the 39 countries, the primary-school age population, six to 11, was growing faster than the number of children entering school. In 13 countries _ including <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the most populous on the continent _ a smaller proportion was enrolled in primary schools in 1983 than in 1980. `` In many respects, 1983 was the worst year of the economic crisis, and it is possible that a number of educational indicators have subsequently begun to improve,'' the report notes. It says improving education would pay off, even from a purely material point of view. `` Farmers who have completed four years of education produce, on average, about 8 percent more farm output than farmers who have not gone to school,'' the report says. It quotes other studies as showing that babies are more likely to survive if their mother has at least a few years of education. Educated people are more likely to be mobile, moving from less productive jobs to better ones and sending money back home when they migrate. They are also likely to be healthier, and to live longer. The report's recommendations include: _ More spending on education by African countries themselves, with emphasis on books and materials, new methods such as radio broadcasts and correspondence schools. _ Improvement of school principals, with more autonomy and better achievement testing. _ More foreign aid, and better coordination, with a larger proportion for primary schools, less for higher education and overseas fellowships.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of a group opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> focused in part on fliers distributed at rallies and public speeches, even though the activities are protected by the First Amendment. Newly released <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents show that agents reported back to bureau headquarters on political literature and meetings by the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>. The 2,000 pages of bureau documents provide only a fragmentary look at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe since many of the pages are substantially blacked out or withheld entirely. But even <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters was disturbed at one point by the direction the investigation was taking, warning offices to stay away from reporting legitimate political statements and lobbying. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> never resulted in any charges against the group or its members. One bureau document shows the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> cited political literature to cast suspicion on <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the still-unsolved November 1983 bombing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol. The document notes that it is `` interesting'' that a flier claiming responsibility for the Capitol bombing `` was passed out along with the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> literature'' at a Nov. 12, 1983, rally. Another document indicates the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tried to find a connection between CISPES and a May 1983 bombing at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The document says that `` an unidentified individual contacted a local radio station in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a few days after the bombing and advised that ` we are in solidarity with the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.' At the time of the bombing, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- were meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> contends that the investigation amounted to political harassment. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, called suggestions that the group might have had a connection to the bombings `` absolutely ridiculous.'' She said some literature on the Capitol bombing was passed out at a CISPES-sponsored demonstration, five days after the bombing, but that the group had nothing to do with distributing that material. Other <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents show the bureau monitored a radio show on which a <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member appeared and tracked down people named in newspaper articles. The files also show that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> switched from conducting an investigation of alleged criminal investigations of domestic security laws to an international terrorism investigation in 1983. At the time of the switchover, then-FBI Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was assuring the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would require more than political rhetoric before it began investigating domestic political groups. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, now head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, has refused to comment on the investigation, referring all questions back to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The international terrorism probe gave the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> far more sweeping authority to investigate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. But a proviso in the attorney general's guidelines for such probes still states that `` no <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> person may be considered a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apparently was concerned that the field offices did not understand that they could be infringing on First Amendment rights. In a memorandum to all field offices, dated July 26, 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director writes, `` It is imperative that these investigations are closely supervised and monitored to ensure our investigations do not infringe upon the rights of these individuals or groups protected by the Constitution. `` Some offices have reported information recently regarding political statements and political lobbying by <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> affiliates,'' the director continues. `` Supervisors ... must carefully monitor this and related investigations and assess operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate direction, targeting and reporting.'' Still, a month later, the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> field office wrote that it `` concurs with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> that in spite of attempts by the bureau to clarify guidelines and goals for this investigation, the field is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political activity can be monitored.'' Asked about the investigation, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON> denied it was political, saying it `` had a narrow focus and was limited to those leaders and key members of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> to ascertain if they were involved in illegal support of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, a foreign terrorist organization.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Frente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Para </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>, a resistance group fighting the U.S.-backed government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s new mayor has spurned the battleship USS Missouri, rekindling a rivalry among three ports eager to be home to the `` Mighty Mo'' and its sailors _ and their money. Despite interest from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says it wants to stick with an earlier decision to base the ship in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where former Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> won a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> competition to host it by offering $ 5.5 million in port improvements. However, <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>'s successor, <LOCATION> Art </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agnos </LOCATION>, made it part of his election campaign to oppose the port funds on environmental and other grounds, despite the estimated $ 100 million a year in revenues the ship could bring. `` Evidently the people of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> do n't want it _ and we've always wanted it,'' Long Beach Mayor <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kell </PERSON> said last week, when he joined local business leaders in launching a new campaign to host the ship. For some, affection for the World War II-era behemoth, upon whose decks the Japanese surrendered in World War II, is n't all based on cold-blooded economics. `` It's a grand and glorious ship,'' said <PERSON> Morrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, councilman who is trying to drum up support to reclaim the ship for his city, where it was mothballed for 25 years and attracted 300,000 annual visitors. The Missouri, one of four battleships recommissioned in recent years, now operates out of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, though it's officially based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and awaiting completion of port improvements there that were part the deal struck by <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is already official home port for one of the other newly active battleships, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, a liberal Democrat, has n't formally conveyed his feelings to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, said his spokesman, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON>. However, the mayor agrees with community activists who say the required dredging would pose an environmental threat to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and that reactivating <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> facilities at <LOCATION> Hunter </LOCATION>'s Point would force eviction of artists and others who rent space there, <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> said. `` He's been very consistent all along,'' <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> said. `` He's opposed it, and he'll continue to oppose it. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> has pledged to veto the $ 5.5 million if the money is approved by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, which endorsed the plan last August and can override <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' veto. No date has been set for final approval of the plan. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Lt. <PERSON> Kippy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, said earlier this month that if <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> fails to provide the financial support `` then that would obviously stop the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from going to <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s Point.'' The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> leads a battle group that includes four cruisers and several frigates or destroyers, with a combined payroll of $ 60 million a year. Elsewere, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a Republican who represents the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area, met Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, urging that the ship berth permanently in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. An aide to <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said the congressman is concerned about the economic impact of threatened cuts in the fleet in that city. The case for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was pressed by Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> in a meeting with <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> last year, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Democratic governor. `` Even when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decided to home-port the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the state has kept a little bit of an ember burning, telling them we're still interested,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. `` I would imagine that based on what's happened recently, the embers are bigger now,'' she added.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s goal of free trade throughout <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> continues to elude him despite nine meetings with <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> presidents. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced his dream of a North American free trade area embracing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when he declared his presidential candidacy for 1980. In the intervening years he has presided over an agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that would eliminate all tariffs and most other trade barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its neighbor to the north by 1999. But after repeated meetings with Mexican presidents his dream of extending such an agreement southward seems little closer to realization than when he first outlined it. The trade pact signed last month by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> faces opposition in both countries, and Saturday's meeting with Mexican President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION> produced scant movement in the trade area. As the two leaders, seated with their aides in cane-bottomed chairs at a long dining table in a seaside hotel, rose to toast each other, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said their countries have taken steps toward `` a special trade and investment relationship.'' `` One day, I hope these steps will be seen as part of the historic evolution toward free and unimpeded trade and investment on this continent and in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` There are, of course, obstacles to overcome,'' he added. Both he and de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, who devoted little of his lengthy toast to the trade issue, mentioned the problem of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s massive debt to commercial banks, estimated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at $ 105 billion. There are other obstacles. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy is declining, 3.5 percent in 1986 and 1.5 percent in 1987 as measured by gross national product, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ecomomy is growing. Canadian critics of the trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argue that it could make <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> an economic and cultural dependent of its neighbor to the south. Between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the mismatch is far greater. `` We are not ready for free trade with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is not ready,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>. There was some progress. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian officials signed a four-year agreement that permits a 6 percent annual increase in quotas on textile and apparel imports from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In return, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> agreed to broaden access to its markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textiles and apparel. Administration officials also had expected a telecommunications agreement, covering mobile phone use along the border, to be signed. A last-minute hitch developed, however, after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentioned the planned signing in a pre-recorded version of his weekly radio address. As the president flew north for three days of relaxation at his ranch north of here, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION> that the telecommunications agreement was `` basically completed'' but had not been put into final written form. The agreements follow a number of others between the two countries. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has drawn praise from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for lowering its trade barriers, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has responded by opening up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market to Mexican leather goods and other products. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has strongly pushed the market-opening moves as a way to help mend the sickly <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> economy and pull it out of its lengthy crisis. As <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, `` None of this is anything earth shaking, but it is part of a larger process to keep the movement going in the -LRB- direction of -RRB- ... freer and freer trade.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting in <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION> was his sixth with de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. He also met three times with the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> president's predecessor, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>. Both presidents will leave office in a few months and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said this meeting, quite likely their last, would help their successors to `` build on the foundation we've laid.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, however, conceded it was `` an open question'' whether the foundation would enable the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican administrations to realize <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dream of a free trade agreement.

 They whetted their appetites with garlic soup, munched on whole-baked garlic bulbs, savored the fresh garlic sausage, and topped it off with ice cream flecked with minced garlic. As far as revelers at a weekend Garlic Fest were concerned, the menu was tastefully done. `` You all have such a nice aroma to you,'' restaurateur <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> told the crowd that gathered at his Covington Haus for closing ceremonies Saturday night, highlighted by a fourth-annual Miss Garlic competition. No one disagreed. `` I do n't think I'd be able to live without garlic. I have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Knarr </PERSON>, 73, of <PERSON> Latonia </PERSON>, who won the Miss Garlic crown. About 400 people attended the three-day festival at the restaurant, directly across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The smell of garlic pervaded the eatery, gaining strength with every garlic peeling contest held on the dance floor. They lined up for the peeling contests, wore headbands made of garlic cloves, and downed dishes spiced with 160 pounds of garlic imported from <LOCATION> Gilroy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a garlic hot spot. Nine women competed for the Miss Garlic crown, which carries a responsibility to try to improve the seasoning's reputation. Mrs. <PERSON> Knarr </PERSON> expressed her devotion to the clove and her plans for fulfilling her reign. `` I'll be on my toes,'' she said. `` If you eat a whole bunch of garlic for a year, you've got to keep running.'' That was enough for the judges, who compared notes on the contestants while the festival's first Miss Garlic, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wright </LOCATION>, sang a composition titled `` Me And My Garlic'' to the tune of `` Me And My Shadow.'' After an accordion fanfare, Mrs. <PERSON> Knarr </PERSON> was chosen the winner and received the crown and sash from <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorrasi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, the defending queen who was forced to sit out this year's pageant. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorrasi </PERSON> gave up her plans to try to retain the crown because some of her family members sniffed at the title. `` My children said I was a source of embarrassment to them,'' she said.

What the surviving candidates are likely to be debating, however, is not du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s idea for allowing young workers to open tax-free retirement accounts or <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s call for taxing all of wealthy retirees' benefits, but who can offer the most ironclad promise to keep those Social Security checks and cost-of-living increases coming. Concern about Social Security `` is in the bone marrow of the electorate,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Six years ago, when <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> had barely enough money in the till to pay benefits on time each month, senior citizens had something to worry about. But after the bipartisan rescue plan of 1983, which increased some taxes, froze benefits for six months and raised the retirement age to 67 in the next century, the Social Security system began rolling up big surpluses. The economic spurt after the 1982-83 recession and the sharp drop in unemployment hastened its recovery. Social Security's trust funds started this year with $ 67 billion. By next January, they will have grown to $ 104 billion. They will swell to $ 400 billion by 1994 and $ 1 trillion-plus before the turn of the century. Those big surpluses are the main reason the so-called notch babies are mounting a widening campaign to have their benefits raised closer to those born in 1916 and earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made a mistake in 1972 that gave the latter group more than they were entitled to. The notch babies _ primarily the 7 million people born between 1917 and 1921 _ contend they got cheated when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejiggerred the benefit formula in 1977. Several Democrats and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, have promised to look into the issue of equity for the notch babies, whose benefit increases would cost tens of billions of dollars. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> governor who contends the system will crash in the next century under the weight of the retired baby boomers unless drastic changes are made, finished a distant fifth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who like du Pont favors moves to privitize Social Security, finished a strong second, but it was his stand on moral issues, not pensions, that galvanized his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> supporters. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the Republicans' most vigorous defender of the status quo in Social Security, was fourth, but hoping to move up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with his unbridled attacks on Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting a freeze on Social Security in 1985. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tells voters everywhere he goes about his role on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, when the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator helped hammer out a last-minute compromise that put Social Security back in the black. `` You do n't have to worry about it being broke. You do n't have to worry about getting your checks. And there I made a difference,'' says <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who also points out that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> voted against the Social Security rescue plan. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman says he did n't like its payroll tax increases. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of repeatedly misrepresenting his plan to allow workers to set up tax-free savings accounts if they relinquish future Social Security benefits. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> says <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s attacks `` remind me of the demagoguery practices by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the 1982 elections. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other Republicans have said it was the Democrats' pounding on senior citizens' fear of Social Security cuts or freezes that cost the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 On the Democrats' side, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> has called for `` a universal needs test to discipline government programs,'' including Social Security, and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax on all their benefits instead of half. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits. The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguard Social Security and its COLAs. As Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> put it, `` We're going to keep it away from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> budget knives forever.'' But Social Security's trust funds will always be tempting for budget knives. They are expected to peak at $ 12 trillion _ $ 2.5 trillion in today's dollars _ around 2020, then be drawn down to nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers' retirement. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> have argued that even when the trust funds are full, they will contain nothing but government IOU's. To pay off those IOU's _ actually, interest-bearing <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds _ du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> says, `` we face a big tax increase.'' When du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> asked 80 people at a debate in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65, three people raised their hands. More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubious about their personal prospects for Social Security. But that sentiment has not translated into support for politicians such as du Pont and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> who suggest overhauling or even tinkering with Social Security. Social Security will always be a political issue, simply because it is such a massive part of what the government does, and the single largest source of income for 35 percent of the elderly. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s pollster, said, `` The elites have attempted to move the debate in a direction the voters do n't want to move yet.'' Young voters do n't expect to get Social Security themselves, <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON> said, but they do expect it to be there for their parents. `` For all of the provocation, the voters are still on the side of protection,'' said <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON>. `` They understand that if the government does not provide those benefits, they are going to have to pay for their parents' retirement or health problems.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders say they have assured the European allies that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not waver in its commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, regardless of who captures the White House this year. That commitment includes the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a resolve to maintain a nuclear deterrent, despite hopes for further progress in arms talks with the Soviets, the senators said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and three other senators flew back to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday following a nine-day, five-nation trip through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where they held talks with government leaders, opposition figures and opinion makers. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat, said the allies unanimously `` expressed support for the INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty without amendments.'' `` We left the message with these leaders that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue fully to support <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ... after the treaty is approved. Those government leaders and the peoples of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> wanted to hear that reassurance,'' he said. `` There was an extraordinary amount of agreement among those leaders and ourselves as to what the alliance should do in the post-INF environment,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` Regardless of the various voices and noises and opinions that come out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during elections, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance can count on this country for stability and continued support,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We preached the message of cohesion and unity.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the bumping of two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships by two Soviet warships in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Friday was discouraging and `` feeds upon and contributes to the kind of skepticism that we found among European leaders'' about the Soviets. `` Here we're in this time of glasnost and detente and then all of a sudden we have one of these unprovoked confrontations. ... `` he said. `` Perhaps it serves a purpose in that it makes us stop, look and listen and remember that caution is the watchword as we proceed with our relations.'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` One of the things that we were most suprised about is there was less disagreement than we were led to believe before we went We read these stories that there were people proposing denuclearization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ... We did n't find that anywhere.'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies believe the Soviets have two aims: to divide <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and to `` try to avoid conventional arms reductions where they have a clear superiority.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` We're all agreed that there has to continue to be the strategy of flexible response. A nuclear deterrent must be an element of that strategy ... if it is to be credible.'' Sens. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also flew back Sunday A fifth member of the delegation, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, flew home earlier The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders visited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfoser </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> are locked in the least publicized, least competitive, least important race in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary _ and if history is a teacher, neither one will win. <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> are running on the Republican ticket for vice president. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is unopposed on the Democratic side, but that's no assurance of victory. In the past, the winner usually has been a write-in candidate with a bit more name recognition _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1984, <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> in 1972, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1956 and 1964, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1964, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in 1968. And the winner gets nothing but a little publicity. Unlike the presidential race that influences delegates at the national party conventions, the vice presidential race influences no one. The vice presidential candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic parties will be chosen, as usual, at the conventions by the presidential nominees. However, some vice presidential primaries have had a more lasting effect on the Republican and Democratic tickets. In 1956, President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> was considering whether to keep <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on the ticket, and he used the primary as a sounding board. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> attracted 23,000 write-in votes, 20,000 more than the runnerup, and stayed on the ticket. In 1972, there was some discontent with <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> as <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s running mate, but that was put to rest when <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> drew 45,524 write-in votes _ the most ever <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, a high school teacher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, paid the $ 1,000 filing fee to try to change all that. She wants the vice presidential candidates independently elected by the people. `` It's something that always bugged me,'' <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The idea came to me that I can bring the issue to the people through the primaries. If I get a mandate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, I'll take it to other states. If I do n't get the votes, it means they did n't like the idea.'' <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, 53, a former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> district leader in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and former school board chairwoman, campaigns in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on weekends and expects to spend more than $ 5,000 to get her point across. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 65, is making his second run at the vice presidency. A magazine publisher from <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, he freely acknowledges: `` Me being vice president would be a disaster.'' He ran in 1964 when he learned that no one had ever filed for the job since the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary first included candidates in 1952. Write-ins for vice president got all the votes from 1952 to 1960. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s total campaign cost was $ 16 for bumper stickers, he said. But he did get media coverage, and attracted 8,030 votes _ 122 fewer than write-ins for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and 1,600 more than write-ins for <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>. `` This time I have a message,'' he said. Mainly, he wants to improve education, raise productivity and cut military costs. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 37, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who says he is an author, also filed for the presidency. His coordinator, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, said the vice presidential filing was a last-minute decision and a mistake because <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> thought he could win binding delegates. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> wants to be president, and `` wants to have 2,000 delegates'' when the Democratic convention begins, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> believes the white middle class is no longer represented properly, especially in the areas of housing and jobs. The three hope for enough publicity and votes to promote their ideas. And in the words of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Upton </PERSON>, the man who introduced the legislation establishing a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> candidates' primary in 1952: `` Maybe lightning would strike.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up Amid Hopes For Shrinking U.S. Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures helped boost the dollar and prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today, reflecting hopes for a shrinking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, traders said. The dollar closed at 131.00 yen, up 1.05 from Friday's close. It opened at 131.40 yen and ranged between 130.95 yen and 131.60 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at 24,207.47 points, up 225.53 points, or 0.9 percent, from Friday's close of 23,981.94 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were higher across the board in response to the higher dollar and the lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit during December, dealers said. An analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> who asked that he not be identified said profit-taking brought the dollar down from its higher opening figure, but said buyers were still apparently pleased with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that in December, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit fell to $ 12.2 billion, down from $ 13.2 billion in November. Traders at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Foreign Exchange said they believe the dollar will stay firm for the time being. `` There is no factor weighing on the dollar right now except commercial and profit-taking selling,'' an official of a Japanese commercial bank said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Robertson Supporters to AIDS Victims: `It's Your Own Fault'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Republican presidential candidates sat on a college stage debating the problem of AIDS, backers of presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> were outside jeering at victims of the deadly disease. `` It's your own fault,'' the roughly 25 students holding `` Youth for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'' signs chanted at nearly 70 members of a group called `` Cure AIDS Now.'' One <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporter outside the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anselm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> debate hall said he heckled the AIDS victims and their friends because `` they do n't live right.'' He refused to give his name. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrelis </PERSON>, an AIDS victim and coordinator of Cure AIDS Now, derided the <PERSON> Roberston </PERSON> backers as `` real good Christians.'' Several members of the AIDS advocacy group retaliated by yelling and blowing whistles at the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters. The verbal skirmish occurred in a parking lot near the debate hall. The lot was filled with cheering supporters of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, as well as the AIDS group and a small group of opponents of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant. <PERSON> Petrelis </PERSON> said his group encountered <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> as he drove into the parking lot for the debate, but drew no reaction from the former television evangelist. The groups supporting the candidates dispersed as the debate began and about 10 minutes later police escorted the AIDS group from the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anselm </LOCATION> campus. Earlier, a Cure AIDS Now rally in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> drew a brief appearance from Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who said more educational efforts should be aimed at intravenous drug users, a high-risk group for the disease. `` We accomplished what we wanted, which was to get one of the candidates to say the A-word. Now we hope to press the candidates harder on what they'll do about AIDS once the field is narrowed down some,'' <PERSON> Petrelis </PERSON> said.

 A businessman who wants to build a gambling casino in an abandoned shipyard says the project would spur economic recovery in this Rust Belt city, but opponents warn of the specter of organized crime. `` I thought they were nuts. I said, ` What? A casino?''' Mayor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Olejko </PERSON> said of the less-than-scenic site, which is downstream from a waste-water treatment plant and large piles of iron ore pellets straddling the mouth of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in this steelmaking city. Even so, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, who with his family runs 25 auto dealerships in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, envisions a 1,000-room hotel that would create 5,000 jobs for <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, which is in a county that state figures show has lost about 7,000 jobs since 1979. He says a year-round resort could draw tourists and conventioneers to <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, and visitors could go to nearby amusement parks, major league sporting events and cultural events. `` We think the industrial backdrop actually enhances and adds some ambiance,'' said <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, who last month disclosed plans for the $ 300 million vacation resort. Casino gambling is not legal in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> has enlisted the help of state Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziura </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> Democrat, to sponsor legislation that would allow casino gambling in the city of 72,000 residents for a five-year trial period, if voters approved. From the high-rise hotel on the drawing boards, visitors would have a backdoor view of downtown, peppered with vacant storefronts or a large steel plant downstream. `` There are few places in the country that have so many entertainment options in such a short distance and so accessible,'' <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> said. The only forms of gambling permitted in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> are charity bingo, horse racing and the state-run lottery. Casino gambling is legal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eadington </PERSON>, a professor of economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> who studies casino gambling regulations, said he does n't view the grimy <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> site as a problem. <PERSON> Eadington </PERSON>, a consultant for the project, said the location of a casino is not that crucial because resorts tend to be self-contained and visitors have little reason to leave. Reaction to the proposal has been mixed. Local officials quickly embraced the project while others, including some ministers, promptly condemned it. Others said they'd reserve judgment until the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> acts. `` I really do n't think the steelworkers will even think about this until it gets off the ground. We do n't believe in talk. Talk is cheap,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1104 </ORGANIZATION>, which has 2,700 members working at the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>. In an editorial, The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer suggested developers might not be able to prevent organized crime from getting a foothold in the resort or service industries, despite tight controls in the legislation. `` For their part, Ohioans have had their fill of corruption on the part of public officials and agencies, of lax enforcement of state regulations, of conflicts of interest and payoffs. Why, now, should voters invite more of the same,'' the editorial said.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is emerging as the early odds-on favorite to win the Democratic party's presidential nomination among union political activists gathered here for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s annual winter meeting. But unlike 1984 and 1968, the last presidential elections when labor united early behind a single candidate _ <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humprey </PERSON>, respectively _ there is no sense of urgency among their leaders to attempt playing the role of kingmaker this year. `` Most of our folks are waiting to find out who the winner is and then jump on board,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, political director for the 494,000-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s 36-member policymaking -RRB- executive council is all over the lot; and within every union, the rank-and-file is all over the lot. Only if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> primary, where he had the unqualified support of unionized public employees, could the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> have made an endorsement before the Democratic National Convention next July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and several other union activists here. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' third-place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> behind Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> makes it all but impossible for labor leaders to tell individual union members now to disregard their advice through 1987 and to get to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a delegate any way they can and for whomever they please. `` I had hoped we could make an endorsement after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and -LRB- Tuesday's primary election in -RRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but now it would take something cataclysmic for us to endorse,'' said <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. However, Ms. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> partisan and one of 42 automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is shedding no tears over the lack of an early consensus. `` If we learned anything from the Mondale period when we needed a winner after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s union-busting, it's the danger of whipping ourselves into such a frenzy that we ca n't see when a winner is not there,'' she said. `` Up until and including election day I believed <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> could win.'' While preferring any of the six Democrats in the race over any Republican, unions continue to hedge their bets, dealing with contenders in both parties. `` None of them has plucked my heart yet,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, president of the 1 million-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the third largest in the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> behind the newly reunited <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union at 1.6 million members and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> at 1.1 million. A plurality of <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> members appears to prefer <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, a spokesman for the union. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also demonstrated strong support among largely white members of his union in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> because of his appearance over the past two years on picket lines in strikes at meatpacking plants in the state, <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON> _ while abiding by the letter of <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>'s guidelines saying union presidents should remain neutral until the federation itself makes an endorsement _ leaves little doubt that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the preferred choice of his union's members. `` In some states like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, we're running a two-candidate strategy with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON> said. `` But the vast majority of our people are for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' That sentiment, while dominant, is not universal among other leaders of the 91 unions belonging to <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> is claiming the biggest role in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> by helping <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> win a plurality of votes there because of his advocacy of mandating tariffs on Japanese and Korean imports if they do not open their markets to more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leaders, however, acknowledge they are not putting all of their eggs in <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s basket because he is pushing their version of restrictionist trade legislation. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> might crash and burn,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Laarman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We're playing by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> rules. Our issue is trade and corporate accountability, but we have quite a few people, for example, in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> who are for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also is the most popular Democratic candidate among steelworkers in <LOCATION> Pennyslvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the union's two biggest membership states, according to <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and other union activists also see <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> as an also-ran if he finishes behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. `` I'm running as a Simon delegate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, if he's still alive after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampsire </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and one of three women on the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> executive council. Meanwhile, nearly every union is treating black minister <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with deference this year, in contrast to their view of him as a spoiler who hurt their endorsement of Mondale in 1984. According to Ms. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could easily win four states _ <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ in the Super Tuesday primary elections on March 8. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> all have big support in the trade union movement,'' she said. `` Only <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> -LRB- a Democratic senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> -RRB- is not slating our delegates.''

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest Fire Marshal Has No Plans To Retire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHESTER, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Looking back on a life that spans nearly a century, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> has no trouble deciding what he cares about most. `` The fire service is the closest to my heart outside of the almighty God,'' says <PERSON> Grote </PERSON>, who at age 96 is the nation's oldest fire marshal. Seventy-five years ago, <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> helped form the fire department that protects this town of 3,200 residents on the lower <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He's been working to save lives and property here ever since. `` The fire service is something that I've given dedication,'' <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> said recently. `` I've been loyal. I've been faithful.'' And he's been active. After the department was formed in 1912, he rose through the ranks to become chief. He was named fire marshal 66 years ago. Although the appointment was for life, <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> has never taken the job for granted. When the state mandated certification for fire marshals in 1972, <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> _ then 80 _ undertook 12 weeks of training to gain his state license. `` He still functions as he did when he was 60,'' says <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> First </PERSON> <PERSON> Selectman </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>. A photograph of <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> hangs in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> is `` worthy of the recognition he's received,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says. Over the years, he has spoken frequently on fire safety before the state legislature. He advocated building sprinkler systems to legislators 50 years ago when the idea was n't popular. Later, he championed smoke detectors. Although he does n't respond to every fire call these days, <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> still drives to most department meetings. His bright red car is mounted with red flashers, and his business card says `` The Chief.'' <PERSON> Grote </PERSON>, who lives alone, concedes to making a few concessions to age. His daughters prepare his meals, and he'll accept an occasional ride to a firefighters' meeting. Two deputies often assist him on safety inspections, where <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> admits he sometimes plays the tough guy. `` If I come into your place of business, and you may have half a dozen extinguishers, and I find one behind the door, I'll jump you for all the good ones that are in sight,'' he said. `` It's not that you try to be mean about it but you see this is an instrument that you might need,'' <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> says. The fire marshal, who retired as the town's postmaster in 1970, has held every top office in every fire association in the state. He's also served as president of fire chief associations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and on the national level. <PERSON> Grote </PERSON>'s home is a monument to his second career and first love. His uniform, festooned with gold braids and stars, hangs where it can be quickly brought out for display. Photographs, trophies and plaques decorate the walls. Amid the memorabilia are birthday greetings from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grote </PERSON> says he'll give up his post _ when the time is right. `` Let me be my judge,'' he says. `` I know when to back way from the table. I know when I've had enough of this, that and the other.''

 DEAD HEAT Polls showed Republicans <PERSON> BOB </PERSON> <PERSON> DOLE </PERSON> and <PERSON> GEORGE </PERSON> <PERSON> BUSH </PERSON> in a virtual tie heading into Tuesday's first-in-the-nation presidential primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. A CBS survey issued Sunday had <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at 31 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at 30 percent, while an <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with 31 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 28. The gap in both cases was within the polls' margins of error. DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER <PERSON> MICHAEL </PERSON> <PERSON> DUKAKIS </PERSON>, the clear <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner in both polls, concentrated on foreign policy issues and ignored last-minute attacks by rivals. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would defend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but would not fund the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. LAST-MINUTE ATTACKS <PERSON> PAUL </PERSON> <PERSON> SIMON </PERSON> began television commercials attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a bureaucrat, while <PERSON> RICHARD </PERSON> <PERSON> GEPHARDT </PERSON>'S ads called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` one of the biggest tax-raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history.'' NUKE CLAIM A Republican debate Sunday night was highlighted by <PERSON> PAT </PERSON> <PERSON> ROBERTSON </PERSON>'S claim the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> secretly has placed nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A White House official promptly disputed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s assertion, and a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aide said after the debate that the candidate had meant missile-delivery systems, not necessarily warheads. HECKLING AIDS VICTIMS: `` Youth for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'' students jeered at AIDS victims outside the debate hall, chanting `` It's your own fault.'' A coordinator for the group `` Cure AIDS Now'' sarcastically described the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers as `` real good Christians.'' <PERSON> JESSE </PERSON> <PERSON> JACKSON </PERSON> toured on a 1930s train, drawing good crowds despite 20-degree weather. `` I've stood with you.

<HEAD>Kohl Visit To Focus On Differences In Defense Issues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that are expected to focus on differences between the two countries on several key security issues. During the three-day visit, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is slated to meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is expected to urge swift <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the superpower agreement eliminating land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Differences between the two nations center on modernizing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear weapons and eliminating chemical weapons <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries have emphasized the need for modernizing short-range nuclear missiles that will remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scrapped. But West German officials have said that upgrading of short-range weapons systems should be linked to negotiations on reducing the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s superiority in conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons are primarily aimed at targets on West German and East German territory. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> recently warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military planners against strategies that would limit a nuclear war to German soil. `` A strategy aimed at limiting the deterrent of nuclear weapons to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or worse, to German soil is not acceptable to us,'' he told a meeting of military experts Feb. 6. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has urged that a higher priority be given to reducing the number of short-range missiles, which have a range of less than 300 miles. The superpowers, however, have indicated that future arms control talks will first concentrate on reducing strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons arsenals. West German government sources said Sunday that the main sticking point in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials could be the issue of chemical weapons. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who will accompany the chancellor, are expected to press <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> anew to work toward a superpower agreement for the worldwide destruction of chemical weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said in recent months that such an agreement may be difficult to reach because of problems of verification. West German leaders reject that argument, saying the intermediate-range missile accord proves such problems can be worked out. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> may also seek assurances that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will make good on a pledge not to deploy a new generation of binary chemical weapons in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, government sources said. Under an agreement reached between <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during the economic summit in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 1986, aging chemical weapons now stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would not be replaced. Instead, the old weapons would be removed from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the new systems held in readiness in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There are indications, however, that the agreement may not be as firm as West German officials had hoped. The news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>, in its latest edition, quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms negotiator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> as saying the agreement might not extend beyond <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term in office. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, told a West German newspaper on Saturday that he favored stationing the new weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` where the troops are.''

 Faced with a two-year population boom, family planning authorities today said pressure will be increased on local cadres to enforce <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s one-child-per-family limit, which has been widely defied. The authorities, while putting most of the blame for the birth surge on a peak in the number of childbearing women, also complained of a slackening off of birth control fervor in some places. From now on, cadres `` who implement the family planning policies well will get benefits, and those who do not do well will not get benefits and will even be punished,'' <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s general office, told a news conference. He did not describe the punishments. He said the move was ordered by acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. It follows two years in which the number of births jumped dramatically, in some places exceeding the planned level by 30 percent as more and more peasants have second and third children. The nationwide growth rate, which had been tamped down to 1.1 percent in 1985, hit 1.4 percent in 1986 and again last year, bringing the population to 1.07 billion or nearly 1.5 million more than planned. <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> said the main reason for the surge is an increase in the number of women of childbearing age, themselves products of a baby boom during the 1960s. He said the effects of this `` boom echo'' would peak this year and next. But his deputy, <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Guoxiang </PERSON>, acknowledged that more than 30 percent of the births each year were not part of the state plan, meaning the women defied regulations and married before the legal age of 20 or had more than one child. Only members of minority groups, peasants in some very poor areas and couples whose first child is handicapped are allowed to have more than one child. Earlier marriages and big families have become increasingly popular following the breakup of the communes in the early 1980s and the reinstitution of family farming. Now that peasants can sell a large part of their crops for their own profit, extra hands translate into extra money. The peasants' new prosperity also means they can afford to pay government fines for having second, which vary from place to place but usually amount to 1,000 or more yuan per year for five years. The average peasant family earns 500 yuan -LRB- $ 135 -RRB- per person per year, but in good farming regions incomes of 10,000 yuan -LRB- $ 2,700 -RRB- are not uncommon. The state-run media have acknowleged that many peasants view fines as an acceptable price for having the much-desired big family. Asked if the system encourged rich peasants to `` buy a second child,'' <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> insisted, `` No, it's not like that. Our emphasis has always been on publicity and education.'' He did not comment further. In a front-page article last month, the state-run People's Daily said the trend toward having more than one child had reached crisis proportions, and warned that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might not be able to reach its goal of limiting the population to 1.2 billion in the year 2000. <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> said the situation was `` acute'' and the task ahead arduous, but he said the limit of 1.2 billion was still possible. He said new emphasis will be put on signing family planning contracts with fixed birth targets. In some cases, women will be asked to sign contracts with local organizations to have only one child, a practice that has been used in the past. In other cases, he said, work units will sign the contracts. Work units already play a significant role in urban areas in enforcing the one-child policy, and in many cases suspend workers for one or two years if they have a second child. Asked if placing greater responsibility on local cadres to enforce the one-child limit could encourage coerced abortions, <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said: `` We are not going to take the number of abortions done as one of the indicators'' of a cadre's success. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> already has 50 abortions for every 100 live births. <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> said this is because most women in the countryside use intrauterine devices as birth control, and that these have a failure rate of about 20 percent.

<HEAD>Funeral For Two Homeless Conducted At City Hall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After battling with local officials for the bodies of two people, advocates for the homeless conducted a funeral service which included the plain, wooden caskets of a man and woman on a downtown plaza across from city hall. Bundled against sub-freezing temperatures and a bitter wind, about 40 activists prayed for a world where people `` do not die in the cold'' and held a service over the weekend that city officials dubbed `` tasteless'' after they lost the legal fight for custody of the corpses. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violence </ORGANIZATION>, said the public service, prior to cremation of the bodies, was designed to call attention to the deaths of 10 homeless people this winter on the streets of the capital. The city says 13 people have died of hypothermia, seven of them homeless.

<HEAD>Pravda Proposes Making Leaders More Accountable Through Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To make government more accountable, top party officials should be elected by all <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, more than one candidate should run and the balloting should be secret, a Pravda article proposed. Activists in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> made the suggestions, which appeared in a front-page article in Sunday's editions of the party's main newspaper, indicating the Communist leadership is seriously considering them. The article said the issues will be formally taken up at the 19th <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a rare gathering of the nation's Communists to be held June 28 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has raised the same issues the article suggested and has said electoral reform will be a key topic at the conference. At a plenary meeting of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in January 1986, the Soviet leader brought up the idea of secret ballots and discussed the possibility of giving party members a choice in voting for top party officials. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also criticized the current system for allowing bureaucrats to remain in party posts for life _ regardless of their productivity _ and discussed broadening the nomination procedure for government elections. Some of the suggestions have been adopted experimentally. In what the government called democratization, `` multiple-candidate elections'' for local party posts were held in several areas in June. All of the candidates had to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the only party permitted to field candidates. In the June experiments, party members in one of every 25 voting districts chose among more than one candidate for local governing councils. Runoff elections had to be held in 59 of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 52,000 districts. Whether the experiment will be expanded is not clear, but the continued media attention indicates the idea is still very much alive. The party conference in June could set the stage for making the system permanent and nationwide. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has also brought a little democracy to the working place. In June, the Soviet parliament, or Supreme Soviet, approved competitive elections for managers of state enterprises. The idea is to make them more accountable. In its report Sunday on a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Kiev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION>, Pravda said there would be a diversity of views if more than one candidate were to run for party first secretary. `` What will remain is a struggle of opinions, a debate, a search for alternatives, variations and a choice of the best among them,'' Pravda said. Currently, only top party bodies elect the first secretary, and any debate about whom to choose is held behind closed doors. The first secretary is the top party official. The post exists at the city, regional and republic level. Pravda also suggested that all Communists take part in the voting, not just members of party committees, and that the balloting be conducted secretly. These electoral changes, the newspaper said, would help make top party officials more accountable to the people, and eliminate the `` cult of personality'' that surrounds them. Another Soviet newspaper, <PERSON> Socialisticheskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Industriya </PERSON>, on Sunday carried suggestions that the terms of party officials and their ages be restricted. `` When this or that person has been sitting in his ruling chair for dozens of years, then no experience he has garnered can compensate willy-nilly for a dulling of the feeling of newness, a fear of the risk of going forward,'' the newspaper said.

 Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Canann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> say an explosion and fire that killed three maintenance workers may have been touched off by a compressor used for snow-making. The blaze, fed by at least five 55-gallon drums of fuel housed in the maintenance area, gutted the building Sunday, authorities said. Resort spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said it appeared the compressor, part of a snow-making machine, exploded and set off the fire. It took firefighters about an hour to reach the victims. No other injuries were reported. `` I was on the slope opposite it when it blew,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribbin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I heard an explosion, and fire came shooting out the back side of the building.

<HEAD>Runoff Next Week To Determine Next President of Cyprus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A runoff election will be held next week between a pro-Western conservative and a communist-backed millionaire to determine who will replace President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, who lost his bid for a third term. Final results from Sunday's presidential election in the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> part of this war-divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island, put conservative <PERSON> Glafcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> on top with with 33.3 percent, followed by businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> with 30.1 percent and <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> with 27.3 percent. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, 55, who remains head of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, conceded defeat in a televised address and said he will `` continue striving on the basis of the same policy as before.'' He was running for a third five-year term. `` I see the result as approval by the people of a non-party, independent candidate to unite the people,'' said <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, an independent backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am sure next Sunday will complete the renewal to enable us to face the difficult future for the settlement of our problem,'' said <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, 56, founder of the largest market research firm in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The results made the Feb. 21 runoff between <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> certain, since neither polled more than half of the vote as required by the constitution of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1960. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>, 69, a proponent of an all-party national unity government, said: `` There has been no victor or vanquished in this election, since I will ask the other parties, including the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to participate in a coalition Cabinet.'' His right-wing party is considered pro-Western. The leader of the small <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vassos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyssarides </PERSON>, polled 9.2 percent. With all 334,407 ballots counted, <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> had 111,491, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> 100,635, <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> 91,262 and <PERSON> Lyssarides </PERSON> 30,832. An independent, <PERSON> Thrassos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georghiades </PERSON>, had 187 votes, or 0.06 percent. Voting was uneventful Sunday, despite mudslinging during the campaign and warnings by the rival candidates of imminent assassination attempts, bombings and other violence. A midday car bomb explosion in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> killed three senior Palestinian guerrilla officers. But a <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government statement said the blast had nothing to do with the election. The candidates agree on only one thing: that the main issue is how to reunify the nation, divided into Turkish and Greek sectors after <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded its northern third in 1974. <PERSON> Dinos </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelides </PERSON>, the Interior minister, said 95 percent of the 362,928 registered Greek Cypriot voters had cast their ballots when polling stations closed at 6 p.m. Voting is compulsory. In previous presidential elections, the result was always a foregone conclusion, with the leading candidate either running unopposed or with insignificant opposition. Since 1974, the northern third of the island has been under Turkish military control. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, ostensibly to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, in the wake of a coup by <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> extremists seeking union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. In 1983, the 150,000 Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own breakaway state, which has been recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. A 2,300-man <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force patrols a dividing line splitting the island east to west. Efforts at reunification through a U.N.-sponsored federation plan have been deadlocked for more than two years. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>'s main plank was the rejection of any resumption of negotiations with the Turkish side unless the 35,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 settlers from mainland <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> withdraw from northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. His two main rivals also supported the withdrawal demand but did not make this a precondition for negotiations.

 A newlywed who said his wife was blown overboard while jogging on the deck of a ship during a honeymoon cruise was booked for investigation of murder when the ocean liner docked, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 36, of <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> was arrested Saturday after an intense <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> search found the body of his wife, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> was taken into custody when the cruise ship Star Dancer docked in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and was being held without bail at the Terminal Island federal prison. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he could n't release details of what led to <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s arrest. The cause of death of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 26, was to be determined by autopsy, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON>. The couple were married Feb. 6 just before embarking on a honeymoon cruise along the Mexican coast with 731 other passengers, the ship's staff captain said. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> told authorities that high winds blew his wife off the deck near the ship's jogging track, but `` the winds were not that strong,'' Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildung </PERSON> said. Chief <PERSON> Purser </PERSON> <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlers </PERSON> said the track closed at 9 p.m. and he never heard the couple running, though the track is over his room. `` This woman was happy,'' <PERSON> Ehlers </PERSON> said. `` She must have woke up Friday morning thinking how happy she was to be on her honeymoon, on a cruise. She had no idea she would die ... and now she's gone.''

The husband reported the accident. There were minor marks on his neck, but it's very difficult to tell how they got there. He said he got them when he tried to rescue his wife.'' The woman was reported overboard about 2 a.m. Saturday when the ship was about 44 miles southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Battle Along Thailand-Laos Border Reflects Deeper Tensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and pro-Western <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> say they are fighting a border war to win a remote jungle area they consider sacred. But the conflict that began in November appears to reflect deeper tensions fueled by centuries of enmity and more recent quarrels related to the flight of refugees, guerrilla warfare and smugglers' quarrels. The periodic confrontations on the 1,000-mile frontier are smaller than the battles being fought on the Thai-Cambodian border between China-supplied Cambodian guerrillas and Soviet-backed Vietnamese. Still, there has been no lack of drama and violence at <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> border with <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. More than 300,000 refugees have fled into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, including thousands of Hmong tribesmen who once fought for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1984, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> fought _ on land and in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ over three border villages. Shootouts along the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms much of the boundary line, are common. In the most recent trouble, which began in November and has been steadily escalating, the two sides accuse each other of trying to grab a sparsely populated area astride <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Phitsanulok </LOCATION> province and <LOCATION> Sayaboury </LOCATION> province in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The Laotians claim 50 square miles of disputed territory. Several hundred troops on both sides have been reported killed and wounded in the fighting, the largest such engagement since the Laotian communists seized power 12 years ago. Artillery barrages, infantry attacks and the downing of at least one Thai warplane by a Soviet surface-to-air missile have been described in official accounts by the two countries. Today, Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> announced that a <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> military team would arrive in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Tuesday for talks on ending the border battles. But he played down expectations for a solution. Since the 1975 communist takeover in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, both sides have taken some steps toward peaceful coexistence. In 1979, they pledged to turn the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> into `` a river of genuine peace.'' But the poorly demarcated river and land boundary is itself a key source of friction. Both countries pull out conflicting maps, some dating back to the early 1900s, to prove their claims to disputed territory. Mutual suspicions are heightened by the activities of anti-communist Laotian guerrillas. The <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> government claims they operate from <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> soil, drawing recruits from among the 75,000 refugees still in camps near the frontier. In turn, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> provided support for <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s now impotent communist insurgency. Lucrative two-way smuggling of items such as water buffalo, marijuana and consumer goods also have led to disputes that escalated into armed clashes. Although <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> denies Laotian accusations that the ongoing fighting was sparked by illegal log poaching by senior <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> army officers, cases of corrupt dealings invovling <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> or Laotian officials have surfaced in the past. In legal trade, landlocked <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has tried to decrease its once nearly total dependence on the Thais for the transit of imports and exports by opening up transport routes to ports in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But a quarter of all official imports still pass through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which prohibits passage of 61 `` strategic goods'' including bicycles, some medicines and building material. The list was reduced from more than 200 items a year ago. <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political scientist, wrote recently: `` <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> controls three instruments that can seriously hamper the development of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>: the reception of refugees and economic migrants from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the tolerance of and cooperation with armed resistance elements, and the ban on transit to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> of ` strategic goods.''' Although the two countries are very similar in language, culture and ethnic origin, the Laotians have been controlled by the Thais and the Vietnamese, from the 15th century until <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> colonized the area in the late 19th century. <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, a royal capital, was brutally sacked by the Thais in 1827. `` For nearly eight centuries the Thai authorities continuously pursued an expansionist and hegemonist policy, carried out tens of atrocious aggressive wars ...,'' said a <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> government position paper published in 1984. In recent decades, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has grown into an economically strong nation of 53 million, while colonial repression, war and mismanagement by the communists has relegated <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, with barely four million people, into the ranks of the world's poorest countries. These differences tend to increase Laotians' resentment at being depicted by the Thais as their `` little brothers.''

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell slightly against most major currencies in light European trading this morning as dealers reported some profit-taking. Gold prices were little changed. Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement that the Japanese trade surplus had narrowed sharply to $ 3.072 billion in January from $ 8.601 billion in December had reinforced the market's more positive recent view of the dollar However, dealers said a national holiday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a holiday in the northern part of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> meant trading would be limited and they predicted little movement for the dollar. `` The Japanese trade figures were very promising, even if not exceptional,'' said one trader with a major Italian commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. `` But they solidified the feeling that the dollar may have turned the corner.'' But dealers also warned that in such a thin market, any profit-taking would exaggerate rate movements. `` There are no other factors except profit-taking that could send the dollar lower,'' said a trader at a major West German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 131.00. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower at 130.40 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates: _ 1.7090 West German marks, down from 1.7123 _ 1.4047 Swiss francs, down from 1.4065 _ 5.7710 French francs, down from 5.7865 _ 1.9165 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9225 _ 1,257.50 Italian lire, down from 1,260.75 _ 1.2660 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2624 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound It cost $ 1.7450 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.7401 on Friday. Gold was little changed from Friday's prices, but lower than its opening levels. Dealers said it was pressured by light profit-taking. Bullion markets in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> were closed for the Chinese New Year. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 446.70 a troy ounce, up from Friday's late bid of $ 443.00. But it fell back at mid-morning today when the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 443.60. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 443.30, down from $ 443.50 late Friday. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.34 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, the nation's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador and a heroine of the Sandinista revolution, died of cancer in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the government announced. She was 39. During the revolution, Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> gained fame for luring a top general into her bedroom, where he was killed by rebels. In 1984, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rejected her as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, who died Sunday, was a lawyer and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, one of the leftist movement's highest consultative bodies. She had returned home from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> early last month because of her illness and was living on a small farm near the capital until Sunday, the government said in a communique. The ambassador `` will be rendered all the honors of a heroine of both the fatherland and the revolution in her funeral,'' the communique added. It did not say when the ceremony will be held. In a separate communique, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, of which Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> had been a member since 1969, said she `` took a heroic part in the struggle to overthrow the dictatorship'' of President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, whose family was in power for 42 years. She was awarded the Sandinistas' highest decoration for her role in the struggle that brought them to power in 1979. The Sandinista communique called her `` an efficient and disciplined revolutionary worker.'' <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s deputy representative to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, is serving as acting ambassador, said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Agendas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> public relations company representing the government. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> in 1978, Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> induced Gen. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, into her bedroom, where anti-government guerrillas cut his throat. Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> said Sandinista accomplices tried to subdue <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, but that when he resisted, they killed him. The original plan was to kidnap <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> and release him in exchange for 59 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> prisoners, she said. In 1984, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected her as the proposed ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She held the rank of deputy foreign minister at the time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration regarded her as unsuitable in view of her involvement in the slaying of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>. She was appointed ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in February 1986. Before the revolution, Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> earned a doctorate in law at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and directed legal and personnel matters for an engineering firm there. She also studied at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and was fluent in English and Italian. After the overthrow of <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> became a special minister of justice for the trials of former members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. In an April 10, 1987 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, she talked about the problems between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the White House, which has supported the Contra rebels in their six-year battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. She said relations were poor because of a `` theory of domination that says that a small, poor, underdeveloped country has to depend on one of the two superpowers.'' Decades of dependency on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she said, had brought <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> poverty and `` the most cruel dictatorship in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... So we are not willing to do that again.'' Ms. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> represented <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in deliberations of the Contadora group, which attempted to end insurgencies in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. She also headed Nicaraguan delegations to international women's conferences in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the 1985 Latin American Economic System in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> in 1984. She was married twice and had four children.

 Valentine's Day sprints by all too quickly for some lovers, but <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maryellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Polichetti </PERSON> were prepared to make it a marathon.

<HEAD>Court Records: Ray Brother Suffers From AIDS-Related Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of three brothers who were banned from school because they had been exposed to the AIDS virus has developed AIDS-related complex, but his doctor says he can remain active. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 11, does not have a severe or life-threatening illness stemming from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>, a specialist in pediatric hemotology and oncology at All Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s ARC is stable and he is showing no signs of progession,'' said <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>. `` He never posed a threat -LRB- of spreading the AIDS virus -RRB- in the past, and he does n't pose a threat to anyone in the present.'' `` If anything, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> is feeling better,'' <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said. `` He's full of energy. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s brothers, 10-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and 8-year-old <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, remain in good health, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said. All three are hemophiliacs. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said a patient who has ARC does not necessarily develop AIDS, a fatal disease that destroys the body's immune system. ARC is caused by the AIDS virus and has a specific set of symptoms, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said. Those symptoms, often less severe than symptoms of AIDS, may include weight loss, loss of appetite, fever, night sweats, skin rashes, diarrhea, tiredness, lack of resistance to infection or swollen lymph nodes. The AIDS virus is transmitted by sexual contact, sharing intravenous needles or by receiving a transfusion of infected blood. Doctors believe the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> brothers were injected with tainted plasma-based medication they received to clot their blood. Information about <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s condition came seven weeks after it first was reported that he was taking AZT, a drug approved for the treatment of AIDS. The boys' medical records are on public file as part of a lawsuit filed against the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> by their parents, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> filed the latest test results in court Friday. The doctor said he prescribed AZT because early use of the drug should increase the chance of retarding ARC symptoms. The Ray brothers were banned from regular classes in <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in August 1986 after they tested positive for AIDS antibodies. A federal judge ordered their return to the classroom. Less than a week after they started school last fall, a fire destroyed the Rays' home. Authorities ruled the fire arson but no arrests have been made. The Rays moved to <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, where the boys now attend school.

 Flooding on major French waterways has paralyzed river traffic, inundated some homes and submerged the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> expressway. About 800 barges on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Yonne </LOCATION> and Sambre rivers were unablie to operate in `` the biggest crisis since 1982,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Boatmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said today. The state Bridges and Roads department last week prohibited barge traffic on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> where the high water level made it impossible for many barges to pass under the bridges of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The water level, swelled by unusually high rainfall, has been rising for the past two weeks, washing out the expressway that runs along the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The River Brigade said the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> water level Monday morning had exceeded 16.5 feet. An alert is given when the water level hits five meters or 16.4 feet, the level reached in 1982. Water was rising above the haunches of the zouave, the statue of an infantryman in oriental dress at the foot of the Alma Bridge near the Eiffel Tower. In 1910 the Seine lapped at the zouave's chin in the worst flooding this century. About 100 homes were flooded in Villeneuve-Saint <PERSON> George </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marne </LOCATION> region east of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and eight villages were inundated in the Essonne region, authorities said. Small boats have been relaying bread and mail to flooded communities.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will challenge any subpoena demanding the identity of a doctor who wrote a controversial essay on a purported mercy killing, the association's top lawyer said A <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury reportedly has subpoenaed the manuscript of the Jan. 8 article in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in which a doctor described injecting a fatal dose of morphine into a young woman suffering from ovarian cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, has said that while he would honor a court order demanding the documents, the association would challenge subpoenas under First Amendment protection. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, the journal's editor, said that he has not received a subpoena. A spokesman for the state's attorney's office, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, would not comment on any reported grand jury action. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the grand jury has requested any in-house memos about the essay and minutes from editorial staff meetings linked to the article as well as the cover letter sent by the doctor and the original manuscript. <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they did not verify the purported mercy killing but believed it was based on fact. They said the author requested anonymity. There has been speculation by outsiders that the article, titled `` It's Over, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>,'' was a hoax. The essay describes how an exhausted gynecology resident gave a fatal injection to a patient he had never seen before. The essay has sparked debate about the ethics of euthanasia, which editor <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said was the purpose of publishing it. State's Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> became involved because the Journal and the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> are based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 It's Presidents' Day and time for a party in this central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s 260 people planned a community lunch complete with birthday cake, children's games and a lengthy bingo session. `` It's a big deal,'' said <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> service station, which is running a special on packaged cherry pies today. `` The whole community is involved.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON>, located near the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, was apparently named after the first president, although some people assert that the town was actually named after a dog belonging to one of the founders. `` You should n't believe everything you hear,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, which may be a sad commentary on the day celebrating the birth of a man who could not tell a lie. But there is no doubt the town has taken much of its identity from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and the symbols surrounding him. For instance, many streets are named after types of cherries, including <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Montmorency </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>. Businesses have names like the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, the Colonial Market and the Cherry Tree. A highlight of today's activities at the community center will be an 18-square-foot birthday cake in the shape of a mountain with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s face drawn on it, said <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, president of the organizing group known as the Georgettes. `` The theme is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s head on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>,'' she said of the cake, which she believes will feed 1,000 people, although about 800 showed up last year. <PERSON> George </PERSON> actually throws a bigger celebration, including a parade, during the Fourth of July, because the weather is better, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, another organizer.

 With shamrocks on the shutters and Grecian columns at the entrance, the house that once belonged to the late Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> is for sale. The 18-room house has three full and two half-baths, a three-story circular staircase, and a heated garage. <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-Shek </PERSON> all have visited the house, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, the sole survivor of the mayor's nine children. <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, 64, said he can remember the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> lined up on the curved staircase, singing to the accompaniment of a piano and string quartet. His family had owned the house for more than 40 years when they sold it to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for $ 60,000 in 1956. The Oblate Fathers have lived there since but find the upkeep too much and plan to auction the house April 23. They hope to receive about $ 2 million. <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said the Oblate provincial invited him for dinner recently. It was his first visit back in over 30 years. `` There are just too many ghosts,'' he said. `` There had been nine kids there, and the house used to be filled with people constantly.'' <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> was first elected mayor of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1914 and served four terms, the last one 1946-50. He also was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In 1938, he was fined $ 30,000 in a fraud case and thousands of people donated money to help pay the fine. He was convicted in a mail fraud case in 1947 while serving as mayor and sent to prison, where he served five months. President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> pardoned him in 1950. He died in 1958.

 An explosion blew a hole in a ferryboat at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> today as it was being readied to carry Palestinian deportees on a PLO-sponsored protest voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official said. A man claiming to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said the U.S.-based group was `` responsible for bombing the ship at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>.'' `` This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it,'' he said in a telephone call to The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The man spoke English with an American accent and the call sounded long-distance. But he would not say where he was calling from. There were no immediate reports of injuries. When asked if the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> also was responsible for the killing of three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> on Sunday, he said: `` No comment,'' and quickly hung up. The <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> was founded in the early 1960s by <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, now a member of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> parliament and head of extremist, anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both Kach and the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> espouse violence in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. There was no way to verify the identity of the purported <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman or to authenticate the claim. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think this is a great act to sanctify the Lord. This is an excellent deed and I bless the people who did it.'' Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> bombed the ship, <PERSON> Marzel </PERSON> said he could not comment on such issues. He said <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> was abroad and could not be reached for comment. Cypriot security sources, insisting on anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> men killed in a car-bombing in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> had been negotiating for the boat. The slain officials were identified as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>; <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayyali </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> port manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jijis </PERSON>, interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, said the craft, the 6,151-ton Sol Phryne, formerly sailed between <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said it was bought on Saturday but `` definitely not -LRB- by the -RRB- PLO.'' He said the explosion occurred `` at about a quarter to six this morning ... There will be ... an underwater survey to find out exactly what happened, how big a hole there is and what repairs may be necessary.'' One <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, told the AP: `` We are waiting for a decision by the -LRB- PLO -RRB- command. We have to see if there is an alternative ship for the voyage.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, confirmed the vessel they had planned to use on the voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was damaged by a bomb in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had tried to launch the voyage from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, but it was repeatedly delayed. Before today's explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had ordered the 130 Palestinian deportees and hundreds of observers and reporters that had planned to make the voyage to gather at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to fly to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. After the blast, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials stopped some reporters from boarding the plane to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where the voyage was due to start tonight. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the car-bomb killings and also linked the attack to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to find a vessel for the voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> started this open war after losing the secret war concerning the ship,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials had no immediate comment on the ferryboat explosion, but Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had decided, within the framework of various constraints, not to let the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ship reach <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> shores, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking before the report of the explosion, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would stop the boat `` in the ways it sees suitable,'' the radio said. The ship's captain, <PERSON> Cleanthis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlahopoulos </PERSON>, a Greek from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, told reporters at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> that he heard `` a loud bang at about 5.30 a.m.'' The crew, he said, quickly abandoned the vessel, which began taking on water. `` The boat was shaking and then it listed,'' he said. The crewmen later returned to the vessel. Cypriot authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 40-year-old ferryboat was the only ship presently in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> that would have been suitable for the voyage trip to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> voyage, called the `` Ship of Return,'' was designed to focus condemnation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of deporting Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. The deportees includes taxi drivers, laborers, a university professor, an Anglican bishop, several mayors and city council members. The voyage was supposed to end in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has condemned the voyage, saying it was `` a declaration of war.''

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s American lawyers, maintaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges against the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader are politically motivated, said they would seek a dismissal of the indictment this week. Lawyer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said Sunday that the defense team would meet Tuesday with prosecutors but refused to say why. He also said he would seek access to the minutes of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> grand jury that indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader and de facto ruler. `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told us that he has always been a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is still a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said Sunday after arriving at Miami International Airport. He had been consulting with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about the federal indictments handed up earlier this month in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> shrugged off a key witness' testimony against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, the former Panamanian consul general in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` wants to be the next president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, who was fired in January, testified before the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> federal grand jury and before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional subcommittee about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in cocaine trafficking. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had provided <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with confidential information on Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, which the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> denied.

<HEAD>Ancient Acid Rain May Have Killed Dinosaurs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A comet slamming into Earth may have triggered a yearlong storm of acid rain as poisonous as battery acid that killed off dinosaurs and other creatures, a scientist says. Animals deep in their burrows and creatures living in lakes with limestone bottoms might have been among the few survivors of the catastrophic collision 65 million years ago, according to a theory outlined by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The new theory is a variation on a hotly debated hypothesis that an asteroid from space doomed the dinosaurs. <PERSON> Prinn </PERSON> suggests that a large comet _ one that makes <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s comet look like `` a little speck of sand'' _ struck the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> with 1 million times more force than the world's entire nuclear arsenal `` This would be a very unusual event, something that might happen once in a billion years,'' <PERSON> Prinn </PERSON> said Sunday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The idea that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs was first proposed in 1980 by physicist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> and his son <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, a geologist. They said that dust and soot thrown into the air would have blocked out the sunlight. Temperatures would have plummeted, and many animals, including the dinosaurs, would have frozen to death. <PERSON> Prinn </PERSON> noted that while there was a large extinction, not all animals fared equally badly. The great land reptiles and many kinds of sea life were decimated, but many mammals and plants survived reasonably well. He said his acid rain theory may explain `` the peculiar selectivity of the extinctions.'' Since limestone would neutralize the acid, fish in limestone lakes might have lived. Hibernating animals deep in burrows might also have waited out the worst of the acid rain storm, and eggs laid in the ground could also have survived. Plants would have been killed, but their seeds remained to sprout after the acid storm cleared. However, plant-eating animals, such as large dinosaurs, would have starved to death or been asphyxiated. <PERSON> Prinn </PERSON> theorized that all calcium-containing ocean animals down to a depth of about 500 feet would have been annihilated. Deeper sea creatures would have survived, as would those with skeletons of silica. Many scientists doubt that something from space caused the massive destruction of species. They note that dinosaurs and other long-gone creatures died out over many centuries, not all at once, so a single catastrophe can not be the culprit. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Raup </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> argued that there have been many extinctions over the eons, but only one has been shown to have occurred about the same time as an apparent heavenly collision. He said this might simply have been a coincidence. Others have suggested that gigantic volcanic eruptions were to blame for the mysterious extinctions. <PERSON> Prinn </PERSON> theorizes that when the comet hit, it blasted out a crater, spewing water and rock into the air at supersonic speeds, suddenly heating the atmosphere to enormous temperatures. The heat made oxygen and nitrogen in the air combine to form nitric acid, which rained on Earth for a year.

<HEAD>China Criticizes U.S. Policy; Chinese Congress Shows Rare Clout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A top Chinese foreign affairs expert today criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for what he said was interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiang </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for its support of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled religious leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, and its criticism of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s handling of pro-independence unrest in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>, writing in today's edition of the authoritative weekly <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Review </LOCATION>, also criticized <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for passing a resolution in support of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> independence and denied that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supplies Silkworm anti-ship missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Some people in the political and press circles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have a very strong sense of national chauvinism, believing they have the monopoly on truth without considering the changing world situation and the interests of other countries,'' <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> said. Anti-Chinese Protests in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> late last year left at least 14 people dead and dozens injured as Tibetan monks battled Chinese security forces. Meanwhile, in the central province of <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION>, delegates to a provincial legislature have called for an investigation of a top legal official in an unprecedented display of their powers, an official report said today. Eighty-six delegates to the <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> signed a motion to oust the procurator general, one of the province's top legal officials, for incompetence, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is the first time such a high-ranking official has been subjected to the scrutiny of the deputies,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. But the motion was defeated by a majority of delegates who voted to allow the procurator general, who was unnamed, to keep his post while the congress investigates the case. <PERSON> Xinhua </PERSON> did not say when the vote took place or what the count was. The official was accused of failing to act according to the law and mishandling a number of cases. People's congresses serve as legislative bodies at all levels of government in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, from the municipal to the national. Citizens actually elect delegates to only the lowest-level local committees, which in turn send delegates to higher congresses. The congresses long have been rubber-stamp bodies, with real power concentrated in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In the past year, however, the official media have portrayed them as having a larger role under political reforms intended to separate the party from government functions.

 Former minister <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> says the peace he sought by moving to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has eluded him as questions persist about the near-fatal strangling attack on his wife. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> says he is weary and resentful of the scrutiny of his private life, attention which grew after his in-laws filed a civil lawsuit accusing him of attacking <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> `` Peggy'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>. `` I'm kind of between the devil and the deep blue sea,'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Sunday. `` And in a situation like that, it's hard to know what is the best, most honest and responsible way to respond,'' said the former senior minister at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has told police he found his 39-year-old wife, strangled nearly to death the night of April 21, 1987, in the garage of their home. Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is now comatose in nursing home. On Feb. 2, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s in-laws filed a lawsuit that accused <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> of maliciously and knowingly trying to choke his wife to death. The petition seeks unspecified damages to cover Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s past and future pain, suffering and anguish from the attack. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> says he is innocent, and police have not filed charges. In November, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after giving guardianship of his wife to her parents and custody of his two children to friends. Since the lawsuit was filed, he has stayed in hotels and with friends instead of his apartment, saying he is trying to avoid reporters and photographers. In the interview, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> refused to give an account of his actions on April 21. `` I get the impression that most people's minds have been made up a fairly long time. I give the press credit for that. I was tried and convicted by the public media very early,'' he told the newspaper. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> also declined to discuss his relationship with psychologist <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, who told a grand jury she had dated <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and who jointly signed the one-year lease on <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> apartment. The former minister said he sought job opportunities and a chance to regroup emotionally when he moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said he is living off savings and from his share of equity from the sale of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> house that he shared with Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and their two children.

<TEXT>
 The main opposition party today urged rival leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> to step down to pave the way for a merger of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s splintered anti-government factions. Lawmakers in the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> harshly denounced <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> after his breakaway <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> boycotted a joint meeting to discuss the proposed merger. The parties remain at odds over the issue of rewriting election laws, with the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favoring a system in which up to three lawmakers would represent each district. Party for Peace lawmakers boycotted the meeting after demanding that a resolution endorsing a system of one lawmaker per constituency precede other items on the agenda. <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers insisted the two parties first solve thorny issues involving basic rules, such as power sharing, to accelerate the merger. Reunification spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-ryong </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> to step down immediately to take `` political and moral responsibility,'' and denounced his reluctance to compromise on the unification. In a surprise move Feb. 8, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> resigned as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, saying he wanted to help unite the opposition. His resignation put strong pressure on <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> to do likewise, but he refused to step down. Supporters have urged the opposition to field united candidates to regain public confidence and defeat the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections in April. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, the government's candidate hand-picked by outgoing President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, won the presidential election in December after <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> split the opposition vote.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has banned fraternity and sorority parties pending an investigation into the death of a freshman after a drinking party, officials said. <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said he will meet with investigators Tuesday to determine if charges will be filed in the death of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> died Friday after a pledging ceremony at <LOCATION> Lambda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> and a celebration in which a `` tremendous amount'' of liquor was consumed, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said. An autopsy Saturday indicated fluid and congestion in <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>'s lungs led to circulatory and respiratory failure, but did not determine if alcohol played a part in his death, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> administrators on Saturday told fraternities and sororities to cancel parties and closed <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> pending results of the investigation of <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>'s death, a school spokeswoman said Sunday. Another student who attended the party said pledges were told by fraternity members `` to drink until you were sick,'' according to a published report. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deliso </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> fraternity members `` kind of had bags on'' to catch vomit. <PERSON> Deliso </PERSON> was treated for several hours at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for an alcohol-related illness following the party. <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> has said that although drinking was not mandatory, many participants were under the state's legal drinking age of 21. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> and 13 other students were invited to join the fraternity during a brief ceremony Thursday night, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, an attorney representing his former fraternity.

 A man who shot his estranged 15-year-old wife to death while she was walking home from school carrying Valentine's Day gifts has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said today. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, 27, who shot himself once in the temple after shooting his wife twice in the head Friday, died Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman Tech Sgt. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> died shortly shortly after she was shot. The couple had married in 1986, but had been separated since December. Police reports say <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> assaulted his wife at school in late January, and friends said she was also attacked another time near where she was killed. Mrs. <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was carrying a box of Valentine's candy, two carnations and a small stuffed bear when she was killed. Authorities speculated <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> may have thought someone had given them to her at <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It appears this is what enraged him. It appears it was jealousy,'' police homicide Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Campa </PERSON> said Saturday. Mrs. <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> did not run when her husband approached, said <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, 17, who was walking with Mrs. <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> said, ` <PERSON> Janie </PERSON>, where did you get those roses?' but <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> did n't say anything. She just kept walking with her head down,'' Miss <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> said Saturday. `` Then he pulled out a gun. I thought he was just playing because he was smiling, but he shot her and we ran.'' <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> then shot himself, <PERSON> Campa </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> said the flowers and candy were given to numerous girls by male classmates at a school party Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Arocha </PERSON>, said his sister was allowed to marry at 13 because she kept running away with <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arocha </PERSON> said she returned to her parents' home in December after repeated abuse and because she wanted to return to school. <PERSON> Arocha </PERSON> said the family had been unable to get a restraining order against <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> after Mrs. <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> said she wanted a divorce. Miss <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was lonely. `` She needed a lot of attention and love and she thought she would get it from him, but she did n't,'' Miss <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> said.

 Uniformed and plainclothes police today flooded key sites where dissidents planned demonstrations Tuesday to mark the anniversary of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s declaration of independence after World War I. The police, accompanied by citizens' patrols, gathered around historic and national sites in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, capital of the Lithuanian republic. An officially sponsored demonstration by workers was arranged today to protest what the government considers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> incitement of Lithuanian dissidents. <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> city government recently announced that all demonstrators must obtain an official permit in advance. City officials said no one applied for a permit. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents, however, said Lithuanian nationalists planned to lay wreaths Tuesday in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, the republic's two largest cities. Western reporters were barred from traveling to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on their own, but the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> took a group of Moscow-based foreign correspondents to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> on an organized tour. Authorities cut telephones of leading Lithuanian dissidents, and human rights activists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said police blockaded the apartments of some would-be demonstrators in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. Last August, widespread demonstrations marked the 48th anniversary of the non-aggression pact between <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that led to the 1940 Soviet takeover of the three Baltic states, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. The states had a stormy independence between the two world wars and were occupied at various times by the Germans, Poles and Russians. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said police began blockading Lithuanian dissidents' apartments Sunday, preventing them from attending Catholic church services, which have become an outlet for expressing opposition to Soviet control over <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said one whose apartment was surrounded was <PERSON> Nijole </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON>, who spent time in a labor camp for disseminating religious literature. <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON> found a note in his mailbox warning, `` We shall finish you off,'' <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said. Senderov and religious activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> said they contacted fellow dissidents in the republic and reported that other Lithuanians did attend church services Sunday and sang nationalist hymns. They said police stopped and searched some worshipers as they returned home after church.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign secretary told his Soviet counterpart today that arms reductions between the superpowers would be unacceptable if they give the Soviets an edge in mobile nuclear missiles and conventional and chemical weapons. Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> wanted to see cuts in those areas as proof of what Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls `` new thinking.'' `` We in the West will be happier ... when we can point to concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an easier neighbor,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. His remarks were prepared for delivery at a luncheon hosted by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, met with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> today and planned to speak with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Tuesday. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also today planned to sign a memorandum in which their two countries pledge to work together to curb drug abuse and trafficking. It is the first accord formalizing drug cooperation between East and West, British diplomats said. In his remarks, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said Western Europeans are deeply concerned about their security now that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In advance of <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s visit, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating that the British government had taken a `` non-constructive stand on the issue concerning further arms control measures.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also criticized the British government for saying it supports a ban on chemical weapons but not denouncing the production of such weapons by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The anti-drug agreement says <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should jointly work to educate people about the evils of illicit drugs and cooperate in stopping the cultivation and trafficking of narcotics. The accord also proposes cooperation in treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts and legal cooperation in tracking suspected drug traffickers. Details of the accord were spelled out by a Moscow-based <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on the condition he not be named. The Soviet Union only recently officially admitted having a drug problem, particularly in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republics where the climate is favorable for growing hashish. Previously, the official media contended drug abuse was only a Western problem. The British government estimates 50,000 Britons are dependent on heroin, cocaine and other controlled substances not including marijuana.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> repeated his claim today that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was an outrageous charge `` designed to scare the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' `` I'm confident this is not true,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview on a <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> radio station today. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> first made the startling allegation Sunday in a Republican presidential candidates' debate in <LOCATION> Goffstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>. A top <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aide later qualified the claim, saying the former television evangelist meant missile delivery systems, not warheads themselves But this morning at a candidate's forum sponsored by the <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` the least we can do in this is get those nuclear weapons out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' though he conceded he had `` no first-hand evidence of this.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could not confirm or deny the claim, but said, `` I think you'll see it knocked down hard in the next few days.'' `` This is a very serious allegation,'' he said. `` You keep hearing these outrageous charges from people, which are designed to scare the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a White House official traveling with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` There's no indication of any nuclear missiles or weapons in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' The official spoke only on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did place missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1962, but agreed to remove them after a tense showdown between <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said this morning he based his claim on testimony by Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. At the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> debate he said he obtained his information from a source in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he declined to identify. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` Some information came to me that the Soviets, in violation of the so-called Khrushchev-Kennedy accords, have put some SS-4s and -5 s in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which are intermediate-range nuclear weapons And somehow, in all this brilliant negotiation that these gentlemen are so proud of, they've left that out of the treaty. `` It seems like, to me, nukes pointing at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are more vital to our security than nukes pointing to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> added. The surprised moderator, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, said, `` You say you have learned that Soviet SS-3s and SS-4s have been placed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>?'' `` Twenty-five of them, fours and fives, that's correct ... You can check it,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` This may be a major flaw in that treaty we certainly should look into, if there are nukes in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s political director, said the candidate was referring to missile delivery systems, not warheads themselves. <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> said he did n't know how many of these systems are in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and he said the information did not come directly from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` but that's where some of the information was compiled. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the top Republican on that committee and leading opponent of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, recently introduced an amendment demanding that the Soviets allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to inspect Cuban missile sites. At a committeehearing Feb. 4, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> grilled <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> about the possibility that the Soviets are sneaking missiles into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said that although <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is under constant and intensive surveillance by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites and other intelligence-gathering devices, he could not say with 100 percent certainty that new Soviet missile deployment would be detected. But <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surveillance is effective enough that, `` We have high confidence that we know whether or not there are Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' He said he could not discuss the matter further in public. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said, `` My amendment on Cuban inspection rights would eliminate this gaping loophole.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON>, the Republican minority staff director on the committee, said in a telephone interview that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> reneged on a promise the Soviets made in 1962 to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to inspect the missile sets. `` The Kennedy-Khrushchev agreement was the first INF treaty,'' said <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON>. `` There's been repeated violations. We need to go there and look and see what's there.''

 A court today released on bail a couple sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery. The Additional Sessions Court set no date for the next hearing of the case, in which <PERSON> Shahida </PERSON> <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON>, 25, was accused of committing adultery by marrying her cousin while she was still legally married to her first husband. An Islamic court convicted Ms. <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON> in November, ruling she was still married to <PERSON> Khushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, 52, when she wed <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON>, 35. Ms. <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> were sentenced to stoning. Ms. <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khushi </PERSON> divorced her in 1986 because she could not have children and he wanted to marry another woman. But the court ruled that the divorce papers she presented were forged. Ms. <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON> was 13 years old when she married <PERSON> Khushi </PERSON>, who brought the case against her. On Feb. 4, a higher Islamic court ordered that Ms. <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> be released on bail and ordered a retrial of the case. It said the prosecution had not investigated thoroughly before bringing the case against Ms. <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON>. It said a retrial should decide the case within three months.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> president, who was arrested during an effort to remove a Confederate battle flag from atop the state Capitol, has vowed another `` day of reckoning.'' `` I can tell you there will be another effort,'' state Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said Sunday following a strategy meeting with other black leaders in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. `` You have not seen anything yet,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said, but he did not provide details of his plans. On Feb. 2, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and 13 other black legislators were arrested on trespassing charges when they tried to climb a fence around the Capitol. During the news conference, the estimated 70 people who attended the `` black summit'' stood and clapped in support of a motion to continue efforts to remove the flag. The meeting was attended by <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinhoster </PERSON>, southeastern regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>; presidents of <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> branches throughout the state, and representatives of other black groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shinhoster </PERSON> asked those attending to wage an intensive lobbying effort and also to gather support from the heads of their local chambers of commerce. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> will consider legal action concerning the Confederate flag in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and three other states. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> called for the removal of the Confederate flag that flies on state capitols in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and is incorporated into state flags in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shinhoster </PERSON> said the effort to remove what he called an `` odious symbol of a bygone era'' has the most promise in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> because black legislators `` took the lead and hit the fence and went to jail.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the flag dispute could have been quickly settled by Gov. Guy Hunt. But <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> has refused to remove the flag, saying it has historical significance and should remain until the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> decides otherwise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the Rebel flag is the `` last psychological weapon'' signifying oppression of black people. He vowed that the oldest person attending Sunday's meeting would `` live long enough to see that Confederate battle flag come down from the Capitol.''

<TEXT>
 A quick-thinking 12-year-old boy used his thumb, a wad of bubble gum and a sock to plug a gas leak after the toddler he was baby-sitting pedaled a toy fire engine into the pipe. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliemeister </PERSON> was taking care of 3-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on Saturday at the <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> home when the incident occurred. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> was playing in the basement,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>. `` He's the kind of kid who likes to jump around a lot, and he just pedaled his fire engine into the gas line. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> said he heard hissing from the pipe. `` Then I smelled the gas and said, ` <PERSON> David </PERSON>, get upstairs and get me that gum on your dresser.' Then I just waited, with my thumb in the hole in the line. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> did n't understand at first. First he brought me Baby Wipes. Then he brought me some of his toy cars. I was getting worried. But then he came through _ he brought me the gum. `` I chewed it really fast, then I stuffed it into the leak. It was a little smaller than the size of a dime, but it was making noise. And then I tied the whole thing with a sock. There were dirty clothes right by, and the hot water heater. ...'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> then called his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who arrived just before <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, who promptly called National Fuel. `` A guy came almost right away,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> said. `` He said I did the right thing, and he seemed very surprised that I'd sealed it all up myself. But I did n't know that. I just did it. He said that, if I'd waited, the whole house could have blown up. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coon </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION>, concurred Sunday, saying, `` The boy responded in a responsible way. What he did was not what we'd recommend anyone doing himself. But the situation was potentially very dangerous, and he took care of it.''

 About 75 homosexuals held a St. Valentine's Day kiss-in outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral to protest the Roman Catholic church's attitude toward homosexuality. The display of hugging and kissing during Sunday Mass was the latest in a series of demonstrations at the cathedral by Dignity, an organization of gay and lesbian Catholics that has been barred from using church facilities. In contrast to the previous week, when two dozen demonstrators were arrested, there were no arrests Sunday as protesters kissed each other, blew kisses toward the cathedral and handed out chocolate kisses. `` This is for solidarity and the unity of the gay and lesbian community,'' said one organizer, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Broome </PERSON>. `` We feel we have the right to assemble before the church to show the affection between us without fear of reprisal. Besides, it's Valentine's Day. What's more appropriate than doing it in front of a cathedral?

 Mayor <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> has accused <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials of trying to spoil her proposed Soviet arts festival with their suggestion that residents be wary of <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> spies in artists' clothing Local <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials last week said they would encourage residents who take in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> house guests during the proposed monthlong cultural exchange to report any suspicious activity to the bureau. `` They're just putting a big wet damper on it, if that's what they're saying,'' said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who is organizing the event for 1989 or 1990. The mayor said her office is working with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to arrange the exchange. Agent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is worried the festival will lure spies bent on befriending and cultivating residents for espionage. `` Our experience is that they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- use these cultural groups on a regular basis,'' <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is particularly concerned about festival organizers's proposal to house Soviets with residents of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, he said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> is a natural espionage target because of its military base, which includes the <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> training facility for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots and many defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents said. Soviet diplomats are watched closely and are forced to follow their itinerary, but tourists can travel at will. `` With that dancer, there very well may be someone standing around with no apparent purpose,'' <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> said. `` And if I were involved in hosting that group, there might be a little funny feeling there that something is n't right. `` It's that ` something-isn ` t-right-here' feeling that we want people to call us about,'' he The mayor said she has discussed the festival with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and will travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this spring to set plans.

 Army investigators today questioned a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager who said soldiers used a bulldozer to bury him and three other Arabs alive. Troops in <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION> refugee camp on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> meanwhile today shot and wounded a Palestinian in the stomach, a hospital official said _ the known first case of a rioter being hit by gunfire in the holy city since demonstrations in the occupied territories began Dec. 8. The army detained two soldiers Sunday and said other soldiers would be taken into custody soon for allegedly taking part in the burial incident. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON>, 19, was interrogated for half an hour inside a white police van parked on a muddy road just outside this village of 4,000 Palestinians, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Relatives had charged in a complaint filed with the army that 20 soldiers grabbed four Palestinians after a violent demonstration in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> on Feb. 5, beat them, forced them to lie on the ground and then poured sand over them with a bulldozer. The four were unconcious when relatives rescued them after several minutes, according to villagers quoted in Israeli newspapers. Three were treated at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> hospital and released the same day and the fourth was hospitalized for eight days, the reports said. Limping badly and with both hands bandaged halfway up the forearm, <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> was helped from the van by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villagers today after the interrogation. `` I am afraid,'' he told reporters, saying he still dreams about the horror of being buried alive and believes he was very close to death. <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> said police also threatened to arrest him if he did n't tell the truth. The villagers said one of the four youths was too badly injured in the legs to walk to the van and the other two were not at home at the time of <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON>'s questioning. In continuing violence today, riot police fired tear gas in the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bahir </LOCATION> to subdue Palestinian protesters who erected roadblocks. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> saw police detain two Arab youths. Police have arrested 21 Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since Sunday, including five Arabs from the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suspected of throwing firebombs and others from Sur Bahir held in the burning of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> car, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. In an army communique today, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> ordered military police to investigate the <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> incident. `` This investigation is receiving the highest priority. So far two soldiers have been detained and other detentions are expected in the near future,'' said the communique. Under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s system, charges are not filed until probes are completed, but suspects may be placed in custody pending the outcome. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> as saying a sergeant-major from the military government established by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and two or three other soldiers were involved and would be brought to trial. While supervising an arrest operation of suspected Arab agitators in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dis </PERSON> today, <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>: `` Even in my worst dreams, I would never imagine such a thing even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most awful things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens.'' A reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said he saw on Sunday a foot-high mound of earth where the incident allegedly took place. Reporters for the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> weekly <LOCATION> Kol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ha'ir </LOCATION> said Friday they dug out a shoe from the dirt. Army officials on Sunday said they were investigating a similar incident in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp Shati. They would not elaborate. Anti-Israeli protests in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have entered their 10th week. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 54 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since demonstrations began. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> today left on a visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after telling reporters he did not agree with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s statement that <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations must involve a land-for-peace trade. The concept of territorial compromise underpins the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for starting a peace process but has led to opposition from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which is against the return of the occupied lands to Arab sovereignty. On Sunday, riot police in the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing Druse protesting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annexation of the area.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> says mail criticizing his decision to set up a scholarship fund for blacks reflects deep-seated racism. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> read 10 letters from critics on Sunday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral at a packed Mass celebrating Black History Month `` We may not realize it but deep in our consciousness there is racism,'' the Roman Catholic Archbishop said. The letters ranged from threats to withhold financial support from the church to anger to what one writer referred to as special treatment for black people. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, 68, said he will answer each letter. One writer accused <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of `` stirring up racism.'' Someone else suggested that the money should go to white people with large families they are trying to put through parochial schools. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> announced last month that he would donate his Social Security checks _ $ 6,000 to $ 7,000 per year _ to the scholarship fund.

A Gallup survey released today shows <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at 36 percent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 28 percent. Given the poll's 5 percent margin of error, they are essentially tied. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had 12 percent each, former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> 7 percent, and 6 percent were undecided. Gallup polled 589 likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters Friday and Saturday. According to a poll for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 32 percent to 31 percent. On Feb. 9, one day after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s victory in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 32 percent to 23 percent The other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates were in single digits, according to the survey of 500 likely Republican voters. The margin of error was 4 percent. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held comfortable leads in the Gallup and Herald-WBZ surveys. The Gallup poll showed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor at 39 percent, followed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> at 18 percent and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 16 percent. The other Democrats trailed far behind among the 424 likely Democratic voters surveyed. The margin of error was 4 percent. The Herald-WBZ survey put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 38 percent. Next came <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> at 19 percent and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 13 percent among the 500 likely voters polled. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll and a <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey, both released Sunday, also suggested that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who is coming off a convincing win in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, is now even with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained the runaway leader with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, fighting for second. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a slightly higher level of support. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey was conducted Feb. 12-13, while the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll was based on interviews Feb. 11-13. Among Republicans, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey ran down the race this way: <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 31 percent; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 30 percent; <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 11 percent; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 10 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>, 10 percent; and undecided, 8 percent. Given the 4-percentage-point sampling error margin for the survey, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are essentially tied. In a previous <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey on Feb. 10-11, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 32 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 29 percent. In the ABC-Post interviews among Republicans, here was the breakdown: <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 31 percent; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 28 percent; <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 13 percent; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 11 percent; <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, 11 percent. Former secretary of state <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who dropped out Friday, drew 1 percent and 4 percent were undecided. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> survey was based on interviews with 374 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey was based on interviews with 594 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters. Among Democrats, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll laid out the race in this fashion: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 40 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 17 percent; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 16 percent; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 7 percent; Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, 7 percent; Former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, 6 percent; Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 3 percent; undecided or others, 5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey gave <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a bit of an edge and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a smaller number: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 42 percent; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 18 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 12 percent; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 4 percent; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 4 percent; <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 4 percent; <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, 3 percent; undecided, 13 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey was based on interviews with 483 likely Democratic voters. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> survey was based on interviews with 383 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters. As with all random sample surveys, these polls are subject to variations because of chance fluctuations in the sample. For polls based on about 400 interviews _ such as both <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls _ that sampling error margin is 6 percentage points either way. That is, if all likely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters with telephones were interviewed, the results of these polls would vary by 6 percentage points simply because of chance variations in the sample. For polls based on aout 500 interviews _ like the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> survey _ the sampling error margin is 5 percentage points. For polls based on about 600 interviews _ like the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> survey _ the sampling error margin is 4 percentage points.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today its gunners downed two Iranian drone planes in the southern sector of the war front, confirming for the first time that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is using pilotless reconnaissance aircraft. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said both drones were downed Sunday night. It quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying the first plane crashed in Iranian territory and the second in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported that it fired on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters flying ahead of a convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti ships escorted through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by American vessels. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had no evidence of the confrontation <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recently reported that home-built drones have been successfully tested and that its war factories now were working on drone fighter planes. It was not clear from the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> report if the drones reportedly downed had been manufactured in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iranian officials had boasted that the drones would boost the country's air force. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s U.S.-supplied air force is outnumbered by the Iraqis by eight to one. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has had difficulty finding spare parts for its warplanes because of sanctions imposed on the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> after militants stormed the American embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in November 1979 and held 53 American hostages for 444 days. Western military analysts say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 60 to 70 working warplanes. In recent weeks, Iranian warplanes have been action in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, suggesting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> may have bought some of its air force needs on the black market. Iranian officials also say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now makes its own version of the Chinese-made, long-range surface-to-surface missiles and other projectiles as part of a drive toward self-sufficiency. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stepped up efforts to manufacture its own weapons after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proposed an international arms embargo of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to force its rulers to agree to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> call for a cease-fire in the 7-year-old gulf war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed this weekend that its forces opened `` direct fire'' on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters that were carrying out reconnaissance operations Friday ahead of a convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ships in the gulf, forcing the American helicopters to flee. But a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied the report. `` We have no reports ... that indicated that event occurred,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Morder </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Travelers Stranded By Snow In Southwestern Minnesota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of motorists were stranded by blowing and drifting snow today in southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, filling motels and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armories. Elsewhere in the state, however, the wind had died down after closing major highways. `` The winds are going down, but we're at a standstill yet,'' said <PERSON> Lorren </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>. Interstate 90 from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> border to 10 miles east of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a stretch of about 120 miles, was still closed this morning, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. It was closed at 11 a.m. Sunday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said authorities were worried some motorists might still be stranded in their cars. `` Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process,'' he said. `` You ca n't use strong enough language on them. They'll go out anyway and then they think the public officials should come out and rescue them when you ca n't go up and down the road. They get real perturbed when someone does n't go out there. But I'm sure there are going to be people out there in those cars.'' Authorities said the near-zero visibility in the blowing snow, along with high drifts, made it impossible for rescue vehicles to go out. `` All the roads are blocked,'' said a <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> police dispatcher. `` Nobody can leave town ... and I do n't think anybody can get into town.'' There were numerous traffic accidents, many of them with injuries, but no fatalities were reported. More than 300 people sought shelter overnight in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armories in <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackso </PERSON>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>. Food was provided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and members of the community, 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Balster </PERSON> said. `` We lost count at about 212,'' said <PERSON> Balster </PERSON>. Travelers signed in from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. ` We got 200 furniture blankets from U-Haul,'' <PERSON> Balster </PERSON> said. `` We got paper towels from <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION>. And people have brought in all kinds of food. There are sandwiches, chicken. One person just brought in two gallons of milk.'' By 2 p.m. Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> motel was directing travelers to the armory. `` Just about all the motels were filled up by 3 p.m.,'' said <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at the Best Western. `` We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the door for one room,'' said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorn </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION>. Worthington Holiday Inn general manager <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruns </PERSON> said 75 to 100 people spent the night in the lobby and meeting rooms. In southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, conditions were much improved today with wind still gusting up to 35 mph but with little snow. `` There's some drifting on ramps and on side roads, but it should n't be too bad,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, a dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. Conditions also improved in northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> 2 was reopened at <LOCATION> Crookston </LOCATION>. Interstate 94 and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> 210 at <ORGANIZATION> Fergus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> reopened Sunday night, said <PERSON> Dayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a supervisor with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today predicted victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and said rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has fallen into the same `` momentum'' trap that snared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the 1980 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told his supporters to look for `` a real surprise'' in the nation's first primary. `` I want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to do what it did in 1980'' when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned around an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> defeat and beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' In 1980, `` I came into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> talking momentum. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got the issues out. And now it's the opposite _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is talking momentum and I'm talking issues ... We're doing better getting out those differences with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on the issues.'' On the eve of the nation's first primary, the Gallup organization released a poll showing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> by a 36-28 margin, with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> tied for third at 12 percent and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> fifth with seven percent. The poll of 589 likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters was conducted Friday and Saturday and had a five-point margin of error. Other polls also showed the race a virtual tie, with the vice president's once substantial lead vanished into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s frigid air and the trend moving in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's direction On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained the leader and the target of sniping by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who are still dueling for second. The Gallup poll of 424 Democrats showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 39 percent, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 18 percent and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 16 percent. Its margin of error was four points. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Hollis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, claimed the race `` is between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and me'' and `` I think it is tightening. I think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> began television commercials attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of next-door <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, as a bureaucrat. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s new ads lashed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> too, calling him `` one of the biggest tax-raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ignored the criticism, devoting much of Sunday to stating his views on foreign policy issues including <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and nuclear arms control. He emphasized his opposition to funding for the Nicaraguan Contras, but said he would use military force, if necessary, to thwart a military attack on a Central American ally. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast himself as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s strong loyalist in a debate with his five rivals Sunday night, while <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> offered the startling assertion that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> secretly has placed nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ `` nukes pointing at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. A White House official promptly disputed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim, and a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aide said after the debate that the candidate had meant missile-delivery systems, not necessarily warheads. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> displayed the confidence of a candidate who has seen all the breaks go his way for the past week since trouncing the vice president in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. `` Some of us would like to see it end Tuesday here with someone winning,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He gently boasted later, `` I have come a long way in the last 30 days.'' Mindful that a secon loss after his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> debacle would be devastating, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged his own shortcomings as a campaigner and made clear he did n't intend to give up, no matter the outcome Tuesday. He insisted he has no `` lack of passion'' and declared, `` My work is n't done yet.'' For <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former television preacher, the missiles remark was one of a series of attention-getting statements over the past several days that provoked <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to say in the debate, `` He has said some off-the-wall things.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in separate television interviews Sunday that he `` would n't have hesitated to kill'' Libyan leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, and that he wants to gradually abolish the Social Security system `` over 40 years, moving it into a private system.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> failed to show up at a candidate's forum held at a Jewish temple in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> where he had been scheduled to speak just after the debate. His state campaign director, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randlett </PERSON>, told leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Adath </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeshurun </PERSON> that he did n't know why <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> never showed up After hurried telephone calls <PERSON> Randlett </PERSON> said he could n't find anyone with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> who could tell him. Some 150 people had waited for an hour at the same temple where, four years ago in an emotion-packed session, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to explain his embarrassing reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown.'' Democratic darkhorse <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, arriving as scheduled, ridiculed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` They told me he was too busy turning the next storm out to sea,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, provoking laughter. After talking for an hour, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` I'm willing to stay here till the sunrise _ whether it comes at the usual time or <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> makes it a little earlier.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the surprise second-place finisher in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was in a struggle with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for third place in most <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> polls. His campaign manager <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> said after the debate that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had meant to say missile delivery systems _ not warheads _ were in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He would n't give the source of his information other than that some of it had been `` compiled'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. Outside the debate at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anselm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, about 25 `` Youth for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'' students jeered at about 70 members of `` Cure AIDS Now,'' a group that includes AIDS victims. The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers chanted, `` It's your own fault.'' Republicans <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> all faced the prospect of having little choice but to drop out if they fall short Tuesday _ although du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> vowed to go on in any event. Third place seemed to be the line that determined the future for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont. In the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> debate, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont both attacked <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as harboring a secret desire to raise taxes. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> thrust a piece of paper in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s face and asked him to sign a no-tax-increase pledge while accusing him of pushing through higher taxes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` That was to close loopholes on big companies like <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in sharp reply, a reference to the giant corporation that was begun by <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s ancestors and is the source of his wealth. The Democratic candidates held their final debate of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign on Saturday night, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> drawing criticism from his rivals for changing positions on taxes and a range of other issues. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> asked for and got a televised apology from <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for a profane denunciation of himself and his staff made by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> earlier in the week. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> boarded a 1930s train for a whistle-stop tour through the Lakes Region of the state and drew hundreds at each stop despite 20-degree temperatures and gusty winds. `` I've stood with you. On Tuesday I want you to stand with me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said from aboard his `` Rainbow Express.''

 Minority demonstrators occupying a building to protest campus racism sent a sympathy card to the university's chancellor today after learning that his brother was ill, and the chancellor responded with a basket of fruit. <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group occupying <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, also said the group had revised the language of its demands to make them more acceptable to the administration. However, he said the thrust of the demands remains unchanged. He refused to say anything further and said he wanted to give UMass Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> a chance to review them. An estimated 125 demonstrators have held the four-story brick building on the UMass campus since Friday to protest an alleged beating of two black students by whites Feb. 7 and other recent racial incidents at the school. Their demands include the suspension of five white students allegedly involved in the beating. Protesters are to meet with <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said he was unable to meet with them today because he had to visit his hospitalized brother. No further information about the brother was available. The protesters this morning sent <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> a card expressing sympathy and wishing <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s brother a speedy recovery. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> responded by sending the protesters a fruit basket. `` I send affection and respect,'' a card attached to the basket read. With classes scheduled to resume Tuesday at the building, an Afro-American studies center, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> is trying to avoid a confrontation, said university spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>. The students say they wo n't leave until <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> meets their demands. `` We're being as patient as we possibly can,'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think you'll see any arrests. They are being very peaceful.'' The black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian students who took over the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday a church had pledged money and restaurants had donated hot meals for the protesters. `` We have n't even had to leave the building to buy food,'' said <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, 21, a junior from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Other demonstrators left briefly for showers and breakfast at home, Ms. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> said. The campus has been shut down since Saturday for the holiday weekend. She said the leaders of the group talked with black administrators Sunday in preparation for a meeting with the chancellor on their demands, which have been increased to include more financing for minority activities and increased hiring of minority faculty. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> acknowledged over the weekend that racism continues to be a problem at the school. `` I think we've got a continuing problem with harassment and abuse,'' although it is not just racial, he told reporters. Last year, the university disciplined six white students who pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a racial clash in which a black student was chased and beaten after the final 1986 World Series game between the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>. A report issued afterward by the <ORGANIZATION> Civility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a group of faculty and staff members that reviews campus confrontations, called for hiring more minority faculty and administrators and urged anti-racism education for administrators, among other recommendations. The report cited the investigation into the racial clash by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, the head of the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION>, who had criticized `` the administration's historical denial of racial problems'' on campus. According to the school, 41 of its 1,339 faculty members and 5 percent of the 20,000 undergraduates are black, mirroring a nationwide decline in the number of black applicants in the last several years.

<HEAD>Women Allowed as Scoutmasters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> officials voted to allow women in leadership positions because fighting continual court challenges had become too costly and damaged the organization's image, a spokesman said. For 12 years, the Boy Scouts fought challenges to its policy of providing only male leadership, spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Corti </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Corti </PERSON> cited the `` great cost to the organization, both in terms of money and in the perception of what we are'' as reasons for the reversal. `` I'm very happy that other women will have the opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> woman who was a troop committee chairman and who was one of several who filed suit over the old policy. <PERSON> Corti </PERSON> said the organization had `` won our court cases and probably would continue to do so.'' The organization's National Executive Board voted for the change during a Thursday meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts, which is based here. `` Our volunteer hierarchy felt boys of this age group should have the opportunity to be associated with male role models,'' he said. Women had been barred from becoming scoutmasters _ leading a Boy Scout troop _ as well as assistant scoutmasters, varsity or assistant coaches, or leaders of Webelos, a program for the age group between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. Some officials were critical of the reversal. `` Experts are saying men must spend more time nurturing and providing male role models for youth and Boy Scouting has provided this in <LOCATION> spades </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippo </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which includes eight counties in eastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and four in western <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Many positions were open to women, including the job of leading a Cub Scout troop, officials said. Of 1.1 million volunteers nationwide, about 500,000 are women, <PERSON> Bollas </PERSON> said. `` There was never a question of the ability of women. It was just that the Boy Scouts felt there ought to be male role models for boys,'' <PERSON> Phillippo </PERSON> said. `` The value in scouting's former policy has been that it provided boys with a nurturant male role model,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>, a consultant for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> councils and an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` With this change in policy, men must be serious about taking on the nurturant role in this and other organizations, or this will be one more instance of women alone developing that type of close relationship,'' <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Goleta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said she does n't believe there is any reason why a woman ca n't be in a scout leadership position. `` I have enjoyed working with the boys. I've been a good motivator of boys. I think it's very important for boys to be around men and women,'' she said. Her son, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, also saw no reason for women to be banned from leadership. `` Some of the older scoutmasters care but none of the kids care,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> today defied widespread calls to resign because of his wartime past and vowed not to retreat before `` slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations.'' His decision, announced in a prepared text for a nationally televised speech, seemed certain to deepen <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s growing political crisis. The 69-year-old president was addressing the fierce controversy that reached flashpoint last week when a historians' report questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral integrity and said he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during his World War II service in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. Today, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> declared, `` I can not but state that parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are built on presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions drawn can not be upheld.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> stressed that he will cling to his embattled presidency despite calls from across the political spectrum that he should step down. `` In the course of the renewed discussion, the question was also put about my premature departure from the office of federal president,'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said. `` I want to take a stand in all clarity: You, my dear Austrians, have elected me federal president with a convincing majority in a secret and direct election for six years. `` Thus it is no longer a matter of the man <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> ruled out resignation, saying: `` It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an election result can not be subsequently corrected.'' `` A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations,'' he said. Earlier today, <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, the foreign minister and chairman of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated his support for the president as some other conservatives appeared to back away from <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. On Sunday, Socialist Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> sharply criticized <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in a televised interview and made it clear the controversy was threatening the government coalition between Socialists and conservatives. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> runs the government in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, while the presidency is a largely ceremonial post. The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition government with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which backed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> when he won the presidency in 1986 <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said he himself would consider resigning if his leadership continued to be affected by the controversy over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The chancellor won rare praise from some conservatives for what the generally pro-Waldheim tabloid Kurier called `` a great moment of television.'' `` <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> has made a huge gamble,'' the tabloid added. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, a top conservative politician and economics minister, voiced impatience over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s failure to act. `` The president must take a decision which is very important for our country,'' <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> emphasized in an Austrian radio interview. <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, who represents influential conservative business interests, said he was concerned about <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s battered image abroad and had no idea how to get out of the crisis. The 202-page historians' document suggested there was no proof that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> took part in war crimes while with the German army, but said he had made every effort to conceal his wartime past until his <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> service was first disclosed in March 1986. The report, commissioned by the government at <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s request, also seriously questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral integrity as a lieutenant in the German army in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> About 1,500 Austrians, including the nation's most prominent intellectuals, signed a three-page advertisement in the news weekly <PERSON> Profil </PERSON> demanding <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation. About 5,000 <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> opponents staged a demonstration in downtown <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s ability to perform his duties, saying `` the federal president must be an integration figure, not a disintegration figure.'' On Friday, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> stirred outrage by claiming that members of the commission were <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s enemies because they were either socialists or Jews. Referring to <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said: `` The president must in the very next hour distance himself from such statements as <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>'s'' and not wait until the chancellor sends a public apology and other officials express their dismay. In an interview with the Kurier, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> belatedly described <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>'s comments as `` unacceptable,'' but he qualified his remarks by saying, `` <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> was a resistance fighter, I believe he did not want to express an evil sense.'' The commission of historians was appointed to investigate <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime record after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government put him on a list of undesirable aliens, which effectively bars him from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was a lieutenant in a German unit that sent thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps. The charges, originating with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, had first surfaced during <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s candidacy.

 A union official today called for the closing of a strikebound <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> mill as company officials said they were ready to resume operations following a chlorine gas leak that injured seven workers. Sunday's leak, the third poison gas leak at the mill since late January, lasted 10 to 15 minutes and was largely contained in a mill building, said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyford </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Two bleaching plants at the complex remained idle while officials from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> investigated and said they would remain indefinitely to monitor operations A chlorine dioxide leak on Feb. 5 forced thousands of residents to evacuate. The latest leak prompted a renewed call for a plant shutdown from more than 1,200 striking paperworkers, who say the accidents are being caused by inexperienced replacement workers. `` We're still demanding that the mill be closed down,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 14 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. IP spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> said operations at two bleaching plants closed by the leak would resume later today. `` I can just say that modifications are being made,'' said <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON>. `` I could n't give you specfics at this point.'' `` State environmental officials will remain at the mill to oversee repairs on the part of the bleaching operation that resulted in the leak,'' the governor said Sunday. `` And the officials will remain after repairs are completed and the plant resumes normal operation to evaluate whether those repairs are satisfactory.'' <PERSON> Lyford </PERSON> said the chlorine escaped when a valve failed to shut off automatically following a cutoff of electricity that halted the bleaching process. Another similar plant was closed while the damage was assessed. IP officials said there was no exposure outside the mill, and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> Town Manager <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said no evacuation was required. The Feb. 5 chlorine dioxide leak was caused when workers severing a pipe accidentally dropped a piece on a valve. No cause has been given for a Jan. 28 hydrogen sulfide leak that injured eight workers. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating the leaks, which the striking unions blame on inexperienced workers. <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> said the latest leak `` was n't a human error.'' Of five workers taken to <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, three were admitted for mild to moderate exposure to chlorine and were in stable condition, said spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said two people exposed to the gas were released Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> last week criticized legislators for doing too little to defuse what he sees as a volatile situation in a town already tense over a nine-month labor dispute at IP. More than 1,200 members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firemen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Oilers </ORGANIZATION> at the IP mill have been on strike since mid-June. IP has kept the mill in operation, staffing it with outside contractors, supervisory personnel and hundreds of replacement workers.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> condemned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today for its policies in occupied Arab territories, the 20th straight year the commission has leveled that criticism. The measure, sponsored by 26 Third World and communist countries, condemmed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for `` physical violence in occupied <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, breaking the bones of children, women and men and causing women to miscarry as a result of severe beatings.'' In another matter, the commission's special investigator issued a report expressing concern over the deadlock in talks between the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and guerilla organizations. It also said it was concerned about a resurgence of death squads. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission assailed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for `` killing, wounding, arresting and torturing thousands of Palestinians'' and for alleged `` attempts to kidnap Palestinian children ... and transfer them to unknown places.'' The vote was 31-8 with four abstentions. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> voted against the measure described by speakers as containing excessive language. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> abstained. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was alone in voting against a second measure condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for its refusal to apply the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Conventions to the civilian population and to Palestinian prisoners. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. A third resolution, declaring as void <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annexation of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, was approved by an identical vote, 31-1 with 11 abstentions. A separate vote was held on one paragraph singling out the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its `` pro-Israeli position'' that prevented `` appropriate'' Security Council measures against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It was adopted 19-15 with nine abstentions. The 30-page <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> report, compiled by the commission's special investigator, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridruejo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, said the dialogue between the government and leftist guerillas seemed constructive in its initial stage but that a recent deadlock was a source of concern The report also expresses concern at indications of a resurgence of the `` death squads'' despite efforts by the government to control such activities. It lists a decline in the number of politically motivated executions by members of the armed forces and civil defense forces while saying that guerilla organizations continue such practice on a widespread scale. It also said guerrillas have continued to `` to be responsible for maining and killing civilians coming into contact with mines they have planted.'' The Salvadorian regular army has tried to apply humanitarian standards, the report said, but this does n't `` prevent unjustifiable civilian fatalities from time to time.''

<NOTE>For release at 2:15 p.m. EST _ TIME SET BY SOURCE</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the full text of President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s speech on Austrian television Monday night, as translated from German by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Dear Austrians; For several days, you have all heard and read a renewed debate concerning the person of the federal president; that is, concerning my person. The discussion is not just being conducted in the media, but confronts us almost everywhere. Questions are being put about mutual trust, morality and understanding one another. I understand these questions _ especially from young people. The great majority of my fellow citizens did not live through the time in question. I also would n't wish it on anybody to have to live through this experience of war. Thank God, the living conditions that existed then can not be compared in any way with those of today, so that it's difficult for many people to identify with what I feel. Perhaps you are also tired of hearing this theme with all its accusations and contradictions. My dear fellow citizens, you have the right to hear from me myself where and how I stand in this debate. It is a personal concern of mine to speak with you about these questions because I want to be understood and because you have called me to the office of federal president in a secret, direct vote. Let's look back: Everything that is now being discussed again, began two years ago. Then, some weeks before the first ballot -LRB- in the 1986 presidential election -RRB- we were all suddenly confronted with severe charges against me. It was a question of my wartime service and people tried from the very beginning to prove that I had committed war crimes and covered up war crimes. My accusers came from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and abroad. They stopped at nothing, manipulations, lies and forgeries were used against me. My accusers called me a murderer, a war criminal and a liar. Without mercy I was interrogated day after day about events which took place 40 and more years ago. My countrymen, you will remember much from the election campaign and will perhaps have believed some of the charges. I tried to reconstruct my war service of 40 years before as well as I could. Much, too much, remained open. Often for the sake of truth I had to say that I can not remember something or that I do not know it. My accusers kept coming with more new charges and always promised proof. But the proof did not come. Finally, I could only counter the dirt of my enemies with one thing: I said it then: I have a clean conscience. My fellow citizens, you trusted me and at the end of these bitter weeks called me into the high office of the federal president of our republic. As I took up my office, I said that it was my concern to place what unites us above what divides us. I continue to seek reconciliation with those who were insulted but also with those who pursue me with hate. My opponents did not let go. It was not enough for them, that my respected predecessor Dr. -LRB- <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Kirchschlaeger </PERSON> took it upon himself to examine the validity of the material against me. He established then that there was no proof for the charges. Nonetheless, the attacks continued. For this reason I finally asked the federal government to appoint a commission of historians to establish whether there is any personal culpable conduct on my part during my wartime service. Some of my opponents, as a precaution, said then that the commission was only there to serve me. Now anyone who reads the report of this commission or who has seen the television interviews of some of the commission members will confirm that they in no way wanted to be of service to me. I can not but state that parts of the report do not correspond to the facts, but are built on presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions drawn can not be upheld. My fellow citizens, you can nonetheless look at this commission report from all sides and you will not find the proof that has been sought for two years of personal guilt and involvement in war crimes. This proof does not exist. The actions of the last two years have ended in the same way as those of the last few days -LRB- I mean -RRB- that telegram from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> which was presented against me as conclusive proof and which has now turned out to be an obvious fake. My fellow citizens, in this terrible Second World War, in this curse for my generation, I saw and experienced endless suffering, destruction and pain. I was then a young man of barely 20 years. In 1938, a few days before <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s march into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, I took part in desperate actions with which we fought against the annexation. Then came what I two years ago called _ in a phrase that was misunderstood _ `` fulfillment of duty:'' I was drafted into <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Wehrmacht. One must see this without illusions and in all truth: There were not many chances to escape military service. In the NS -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- dictatorship, hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, had no other option. I have great respect for the heroes and martyrs of that time, but they were, as always in history, only a few. MORE

 Surgeons transplanted a heart into a 3-week-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> boy today, while a week-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> boy began his first full day with a new heart. At Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> went into surgery around midnight and emerged at 10:15 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. He was in critical condition. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, the son of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> of Beaver Falls, was born Jan. 25. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a boy identified only as <PERSON> Christoffer </PERSON> received a new heart in a five-hour operation Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>. `` I have a Valentine's Day story for you,'' said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>.

Both boys were born with hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a lethal underdevelopment of the left side of the heart, the hospital officials said. The <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital's youngest transplant patient before <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> was a 24-day-old boy from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> who received a new liver in July 1986. The <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> hospital has done several transplants on babies, including 13 heart transplants on children under 4 months, counting <PERSON> Christoffer </PERSON>'s surgery. Ten of those 13 children are alive. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a pioneer in infant heart transplant surgery, stirred controversy in 1984 when he transplanted a baboon's heart into a child known as Baby Fae in an effort to save her life. The girl died 20 days after the transplant.

 Tourists are harassing the uniformed sentries at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, according to lawmakers who want the government to do something about it. `` I have quite often seen pretty girls putting their arms around soldiers on duty outside St. <PERSON> James </PERSON>' Palace, while their friends take teasing photographs of them,'' said legislator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenway </PERSON>. `` Sometimes they hug the soldiers round the neck and squeeze them. It requires the patience of Job for a young soldier not to react angrily _ or indeed in any other way,'' he said. At <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s official residence, sentries were moved in the 1960s from outside the gates to the courtyard, where the public can not enter, after one soldier got fed up with being pestered and banged the butt of his rifle on a woman's foot. But there's no courtyard at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION>' Palace, which houses court officials and is less famous, and tourists can touch the sentries there, if they dare.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader called today for his colleagues to scrap a plan to meet privately during the impeachment trial of Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The decision to allow for closed meetings had been criticized by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer and had touched off protests and editorials from news organizations. `` It has become evident after several days of comments regarding the adopted Court of Impeachment rules from both the public and the press that the intent of our actions has been misinterpreted,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> and Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. `` It appears to me that the benefits to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be significantly outweighed by the detriments to the process,'' he added. Usdane, like <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> a Republican, suggested that the rules be changed to require that all deliberations in public and to either ban secret meetings or require a majority vote before any closed meeting. <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> declined to say whether he would support the change. But several rank-and-file Republicans said they favored it and <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said he believed his caucus would go along with it. A two-thirds vote is needed to change the rules. <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> said deliberating in the open `` will erase any question as to the fairness and honesty of the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution of having broken laws by concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, lending $ 80,000 to his car dealership and obstructing justice. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who also faces a May 17 recall election and a criminal indictment over the $ 350,000 loan, has said repeatedly that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Rules approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> require a closed conference at the request of any single senator.

Indeed, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s on-the-record reaction to what <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers called the deliberate and dangerous Soviet bumping of American warships operating innocently in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> included comments that conveyed more exasperation than outrage. `` As Secretary of State <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said just a week ago, we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet behavior,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>. It is, after all, `` a competetive relationship,'' <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said. The statement reflected the administration policy, since the rise of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985, of keeping distasteful and bitter bilateral disputes from poisoning efforts to elicit from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a better human rights record, arms control compromises and a withdrawal of troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Over the past three years, whether the issue has been alleged Soviet spying, the jailing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON>, or attacks on American military observers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has complained _ taken retaliatory action in some cases _ and then gone back to the bargaining table. The most serious bilateral blow-up in recent years _ and the one that came closest to upsetting overall relations _ was the <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> case. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent was arrested in August 1986 on espionage charges and held in prison for several days, despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unwavering denials that <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> was a spy. <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> was arrested after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities jailed <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> employee, who the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said really was a spy. After long negotiations, the affair was settled by both men being sent home in a deal that paved the way for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to meet Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at a summit in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> a month later. Another major controversy erupted over charges that Soviet intelligence had compromised secrecy at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ first by planting bugging devices in a new chancery building and then by compromising Marine guards responsible for security at the existing embassy office. Concern about the two breaches of security reached their height in early 1987, after three former Marine guards at the embassy were arrested on suspicion of letting Soviet agents prowl through secure areas of the embassy. At the time, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were trying to achieve a breakthrough on a deal to limit intermediate range nuclear missiles. Although <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> considered calling off a planned conference with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to work on the arms pact because of the security problem, he went forward with the meeting. By all accounts of his sessions with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has raised the bilateral issues and complained about the alleged spying and bugging. He also has protested attacks by Soviet troops on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military observers operating in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> under post World War II peace agreements. Yet the complaints remain in a separate compartment from the other issues. As <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, has put it: `` There will always be set-backs in a relationship that is continuously evolving. We will always have our problems with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; that is inevitable. When they do things we do n't like we tell them; often very forcefully. `` The goal is to try to manage the relationship.''

<HEAD>Local School Boards Look To State Leadership On AIDS Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If there's anything local school boards usually do n't like, it's orders from above. But many are finding they need strong state leadership to overcome community obstacles to teaching children about AIDS. `` This is a unique situation,'' said <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, co-director of the AIDS education project at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` In a lot of instances, state requirements are resented and are counterproductive,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. `` But this is a case where many local boards are facing opposition in their communities and they're looking to the state for a requirement They want to go back to the community and say, ` Look, this is something we're required to do. Let's figure out how.''' Eighteen states require that schoolchildren be taught about the incurable disease, the school boards group found in a survey last December. Among those without specific AIDS education requirements are some states with high concentrations of AIDS cases, including <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> predicted a flurry of activity in many states in the next few months, not all of it constructive. `` There are states where legislators are putting bill after bill in front of the legislature, and some of them are not well considered,'' she said. `` The people putting them forward are not really familiar with the facts. There's a great deal of confusion about what ought to be done.'' One state, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, has a mandatory statewide AIDS curriculum. But most educators and health professionals, including the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, say the key to a successful program is broad community involvement. `` There's nothing wrong with saying there are the topics you have to cover. But getting into curriculum, that should be local,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. `` If parents and the community do n't support what the schools are teaching, the program wo n't work. Kids have to be getting the same education at home and at church as they are at school for it to work.'' <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> is a state with what some experts consider a model policy. The state board requires AIDS instruction and teacher training. The general goal is to promote sexual abstinence and fidelity. But what is taught, who teaches it and how it is taught are decisions made at the local level. `` Local school boards were not offering AIDS education because of local pressure opposing it,'' <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> state board member <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee last week. `` I do n't think that local districts would be teaching about AIDS now without strong state leadership on the issue.'' <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> said AIDS education ideally should be within the context of health instruction, because if students do n't understand germs and the immune system, they will not understand AIDS and how to avoid it. `` But if schools do n't already have a comprehensive health program, they ca n't afford to wait. Young people need information about AIDS now,'' said <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors of the state school boards group. Simply requiring AIDS instruction is not enough, <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> added. She said few states have provided funds for their education efforts; few have figured out how to reach youths at high risk of infection, many of whom are not in school; and few have systems to evaluate and monitor the success of AIDS education in local schools. <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> said public misconceptions, even among policymakers, are a formidable barrier to the development of successful AIDS education programs. For example, she said, a 1987 survey of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> school principals in 47 districts showed that most could not correctly answer more than seven of 14 factual questions about AIDS. The state school boards group and two other national education groups have received grants this year from the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> to help states develop or strengthen AIDS prevention policies. The grants are part of the $ 30 million <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> will spend this year on state prevention efforts targeted at school-age and college youth. Financial and technical help will be available to all state departments of education, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> official told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee last week. The center publishes a bibliography of AIDS teaching resources and last month published `` <ORGANIZATION> Guidelines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent the Spread of AIDS.'' The guidelines recommend broad community participation and prescribe instruction in preventive behavior ranging from abstinence to condom use. The guidelines also graphically describe what students should know at various age levels.

 Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s landslide victory in the presidential election was achieved through widespread fraud, according to opposition leaders and foreign observers. The 75-year-old president and his governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday won an eighth straight term, receiving 88.6 percent of the vote, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON> announced. <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON> is also party president. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, elected to a five-year-term, has governed the nation of 3.8 million people since taking power in an army coup in 1954. One opposition leader was detained during the voting. Opposition groups and foreign representatives invited to observe the voting said they witnessed irregularities that included: the absence of opposition ballots at polling stations, a lack of closed booths to ensure secret balloting, voting by underage voters and ballot box stuffing. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest governing head of state. Among current world leaders, only <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kim-Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, who came to power in 1948, has led a country longer. The unofficial final vote tally, announced by the party today, gave the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> 1,186,693, or 88.6 percent of the total cast. A total of 1,446,665 voters were registered. The <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose presidential candidate was Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 65, was a distant second with 96,231 votes, or 7.18 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> Ybarra </PERSON>, 54, was third with 42,056 votes, or 3.14 percent. Final returns were expected to be released later today. The government said voter turnout was high, but did not provide a figure. The opposition said turnout was lower than 50 percent in many urban areas. The victory, which <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON> called proof `` the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> holds an absolute majority in the countryside and the cities,'' also gave the party two-thirds of the 72 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and 36 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats. The remaining one-third will be split among the two other parties according to the proportion of votes the two losers received. The opposition candidates who participated Sunday represented two of the country's three officially recognized opposition groups. The third party, the <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has not participated in elections or government since 1973. Three unrecognized parties, the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, had urged voters to boycott the elections. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was detained most of Sunday at a government office in <LOCATION> Col. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION>, 80 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, and released when the polls had closed. He then held a news conference to denounce the elections. `` The fraud of Feb. 14 will not be like others,'' <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> said. `` It will be <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s burial ground.'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Greisgaber </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consultant to the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> entity, said she witnessed underage voters casting ballots in Col. <PERSON> Oviedo </PERSON>. `` We also were told that area cotton farmers had been told cotton prices would not be increased if they did not vote or that they would not be able to sell their crops,'' she said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer with the same institute, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, said a car in which he and opposition politicians were riding was stopped in <LOCATION> Ypacarai </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, by a group of men in plainclothes and police uniforms. `` We were mistreated without provocation and treated in a beastly fashion,'' said <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>. He said the car's driver, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Perreira </PERSON>, leader of a dissident faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was struck several times. Uruguayan lawmaker <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamas </PERSON> said he saw voters barred from casting ballots in secret as well as individuals casting `` up to 10 ballots.'' Most opposition rallies at <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> and a half-dozen other towns were peaceful. But in <LOCATION> Carapegua </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, police armed with clubs broke up a demonstration, and a rally at Col. <ORGANIZATION> Oviedo </ORGANIZATION> was suspended due to fear of violence. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government in its 1987 human rights report, which said `` <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> has not had a democratic government since its independence in 1811. In the victory speech, <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON> promised the government would promote investment of domestic and foreign capital, combat unemployment, eliminate slums and shantytowns and distribute land to poor farmers. `` We will continue to be anti-communist,'' he emphasized, `` and no one will surprise us flirting with Marxism wherever it may be.''

 From gypsy moths in the <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> to wild pigs in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smokies </LOCATION> to creeping kudzu in the West, an invasion of exotic animal and plant species is threating the nation's national parks. A draft summary of a major, just-completed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> assessment of the condition of natural and cultural resources lists `` encroachment by plants and animals not native to park environments'' ahead of any other `` major issues and threats'' to natural resources. Sometimes the invasion is part of the ebb and flow of nature, as with gypsy moths attacking trees in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Shenandoah National Park. Sometimes it is the end of a complex process kicked off by humans, as in the replacement of sawgrass with cat-tail plants in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as a result of fertilizer-laden water entering the swamp. That changes the whole food chain in the park. Sometimes it is n't easy to decide, as with the ravages of vegetation caused by wild pigs in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> or goats in Olympic National Park in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, or the invasion of kudzu or eucalyptus at several sites in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or West. Sometimes nothing can really be done as nature slowly replaces one species with another over the course of a century or so. In an interview, parks director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said: `` In the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> everglades we have the invasion of the Brazilian pepper; we have the invasion of the Australian pine. ... It may be there is no way on God's green earth that we can eliminate the pepper, for example. ... Over a period of time, it may be that will be the ecology of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, added, `` It seems to me one of the roles of the national parks is to illustrate that kind of process.'' There are few really new individual facts about exotic species in the study, just their appearance in different places. `` What the assessment points out is that exotic plants and animals are a problem in more places than we would have thought,'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. The study, launched by <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> when he took over the service two years ago, is the first of its kind since park managers were asked to list threats to their units in 1980. Results of the exercise, which will be repeated every three years, have been computerized for easy access throughout the park system. Funds from new and increased visitor fees will be directed at what park managers judge the most important problems uncovered in the assessment. This will mean an extra $ 52 million a year before collection expenses, with 10 percent of the net reserved for a special director's discretionary fund, to be spent on research and protection of resources or interpretation for visitors. Nearly 60 percent of park managers said their installations were threatened in one way or another, one-third of them by activities outside park boundaries. Most natural resources were judged in fair condition, with only 15 percent described as poor. But the managers said they needed to undertake 2,500 projects over the next three years at what the service estimated would be $ 250 million to $ 300 million, a sum it noted `` far exceeds the current <ORGANIZATION> NPS </ORGANIZATION> budget.'' For cultural resources _ roughly half the units in the system commemorate something _ managers said a quarter of the sites, a third of the buildings and a third of the collections were in good condition. Most sites and structures that are well-documented `` are relatively free of serious adverse impacts.'' `` But the status of many cultural resources is unknown because of an enormous backlog of historical research, documentation, inspections and cataloguing,'' the summary said in noting that only 12 percent of its museum collections had been catalogued. Major problem categories for natural resources _ many also listed in the 1980 report _ were described as scars from mining, grazing or farming; overuse; hunting or poaching; legal mineral exploitation; loss of water and air quality, as from acid rain; and development near park boundaries. Cultural resources were said to be threatened by weathering and erosion; vandalism and looting; deficient storage of artifacts; a paperwork backlog; lack of vegetation control and lack of specialized expertise.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime is in firm control as his fundamentalist Islamic revolution begins its 10th year, but a power struggle looms when the 87-year-old patriarch dies. His lieutenants appear to be preparing for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death, which will be a major test for the revolution at a time of war, economic hardship and increasing international isolation. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is reported in poor health and has sought recently, after years of reluctance, to eliminate obstacles to economic and social reform. He remains the revered Imam, symbol of an Islamic resurgence that toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> and brought <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> home in triumph Feb. 1, 1979, after 15 years in exile. The old man's messianic charisma and authority have held the revolution together through the long war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s other pressing international and domestic problems Jockeying for position in the misty world of Iranian politics has intensified because of elections for the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, scheduled for April 8. Chief among the rival camps are the revolutionary purists personified by Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and those called pragmatists, who are led by the parliament speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. No threat is evident to the regime itself despite political rivalries and domestic grumbling. Senior revolutionary leaders acknowledge public discontent but say economic hardship stems from the war, not the revolution. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border incidents. They also claim more public projects have been completed than under the shah and more has been done for the `` mostathafeen'' -LRB- deprived -RRB-, the millions of slum dwellers and peasants who formed the bedrock support for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. Streets are full of people searching for bargains in the well-stocked stores, which are prohibitively expensive, or standing in long lines outside shops that sell rationed goods at government-controlled prices. Everything is available on the black market _ or `` free market,'' as the Iranians call it _ at 10 times the official price. <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalkali </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor who ordered the execution of hundreds of opponents in the revolution's early days, had this to say about political disagreement during a recent Majlis debate: `` The brave troops at the front should not be worried by what may appear to be irreconcilable disagreements. Security remains tight, there is great distrust of foreigners, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still is the `` Great Satan.'' Revolutionary Guards, fanatical followers of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> who are present in every village and city neighborhood, appear to have stifled resistance. Islamic puritanism, pervasive in the early days after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s return, has been relaxed somewhat Many women still wear the black head-to-toe chador. A sign outside <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main bus terminal declares in English and <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>: `` Women not wearing Islamic garb will not be allowed to enter.'' Others appear in public wearing only headscarves, however, and many women use lipstick and makeup. Such `` Western decadence'' a few years ago would have meant arrest and humiliation by the <PERSON> Gashte </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahrah </PERSON>, the religious vigilantes who patrol the city in unmarked cars watching for moral turpitude. Gashte Zahrah patrols have not disappeared, but they are less active. Enforcement of the ban on alcoholic beverages also has eased. Whisky, vodka and other liquor are readily available on the black market. Crowds are large at movie theaters, where the fare generally is patriotic epics, sagas of ancient Persian glories, or feature films from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. State-run television's two channels are dominated by religious and political discussions, war footage and documentaries extolling Iranian victories. The government's efficient security network extends to village level. Cities, offices, schools and businesses are governed by Islamic councils, run by loyalists of the regime. By Western count two million Iranians, many of them middle class, have fled rather than put up with Islamic restrictions, economic privation and sending their sons to the war. An estimated 600,000 Iranians have been killed and 750,000 wounded, but foreign diplomats say the conflict has helped strengthen the revolution despite the cost. It has built patriotic fervor in the mass of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem population of about 50 million against the Iraqis, who are Arabs and ancient enemies `` There's dissatisfaction with the strict Islamic rules imposed on people and with the economic hardship, but at the same time most people are proud that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has resisted the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> invasion and so much pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' one Western diplomat said privately. `` People realize there's little they can do. They live in hope the war may end soon, either through victory or a settlement, so that at least their economic hardship will be alleviated.''

 The party spread throughout the French Quarter today as clear skies and 60-degree weather brought revelers into the streets for the last day of Carnival before <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>. Many people had the day off for Presidents' Day, and the French Quarter filled with hard-drinking crowds.

The child was reported in good condition today at a hospital. Krewe of Bacchus member <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> was booked with battery on a police officer and resisting arrest, police said. In addition, two bystanders were booked with interfering with a police officer.

 A businessman today publicly tied a key Haitian military official to drug trafficking, and said officials of that nation's government also were involved. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> told a news conference that he was going to the media because the federal government was stalling on promises to protect him. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, who said he ran a seafood operation here until he became involved with the smuggling effort in August 1986, has been testifying before a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> about the Haitian drug connection. He said he met with Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander-in-chief of the Dessalines battalion in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, in December 1986 and arranged for 100 kilograms of cocaine to be shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The battalian was blamed for repression of anti-government demonstrators last summer. `` We flew -LRB- the shipment -RRB- out of his own personal ranch in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>. The cocaine was flown through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he said. Asked if higher Haitian government officials were involved in the smuggling, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> said `` yes,'' but refused to identify them. He and said he would make the names public later. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said he was twice tracked by Haitian hit squads, with one following him the to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> where he was meeting with an agent. That group was arrested when they were spotted waiting outside the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office, he said, but were released a few days later. A second group later ran him off a highway. Those men were frightened away by a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer who happened by, said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> had been warned by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in January that he would not get into the federal witness protection program if he talked to the media about his case.

<TEXT>
 Opening of negotiations and relative quiet on the warfront have sparked a glimmer of hope that two decades of savage conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> can be solved through political compromise rather than more bloodshed. After an 8-year-long stalemate, two rounds of peace talks were recently held between key protagonists: <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of the pro-Hanoi regime in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978, now says that if an acceptable political solution is reached, it may withdraw its troops before an announced 1990 pull-out. And <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has indicated it wants to heal itself of two festering <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> sores: <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Although negotiations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last December and January did not produce a mutually acceptable blueprint for peace, both sides say they are working toward freedom from outside interference and an end to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s cycle of agony. Since 1970, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has suffered a devastating five-year war; a reign of terror by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>; the Vietnamese invasion; and a continuing guerrilla war. Millions have perished. Deep suspicions of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s motives remain, as do fears of a return to power of the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. And analysts are puzzled by the moves of the unpredictable prince, who on Jan. 30 resigned as head of a three-party resistance coalition and who regularly lashes out at his partners-in-war. The 65-year-old <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> _ onetime king, consummate survivor, enduringly popular leader _ headed a coalition of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and his own followers fighting the Vietnamese. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> arms the coalition. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> fuels <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s war machine. Stressing that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was eager to attract investment from the West, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> adviser <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> admitted recently the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was `` a very costly proposition. It has drained our resources.'' Besides the burden of keeping about 140,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the opportunity costs are great: most non-Soviet bloc nations continue to shun <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, insisting on a troop withdrawal before engaging in full trade and aid relations with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Also widely seen as helping the process of political settlement are the rise of seemingly more flexible leaders: <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s followers in Peking, and <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cites the Vietnamese grip on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as a key barrier to detente with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which appears to be seeking closer ties with Peking. Changes are also perceived in the military situation. `` I ca n't tell you who is winning the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> ... but presently both sides are turning to political means instead of fighting on the battlefield,'' says Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Sihadaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunnag </PERSON>, spokesman of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s military command Several Western analysts interviewed agree that in recent months fighting has decreased substantially, although reasons given for this are largely speculative. Rather than seeking combat, one theory says, the resistance guerrillas are concentrating on grass-roots organization and propaganda, trying to solidify support for their respective groups in event action shifts to the political arena. Militarily, the balance appears to be unchanged from recent years: the estimated 50,000-strong fighters of the coalition ca n't defeat the Vietnamese but would probably rout the weak, pro-Hanoi Cambodian army if <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> pulled out The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> remains the most powerful military force within the coalition. For many Western and Thai analysts a `` worst case scenario'' would be Vietnamese entrenchment in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>; continued warfare; the indefinite existence of 250,000 Cambodian refugees along the Thai-Cambodian border. Perhaps the most optimistic future envisioned by Western observers is a Vietnamese pull-out; a coalition government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as a major figure; and a withering away of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> through defections of younger conscripts and general hatred of a force robbed of its major appeal: fighting a foreign invader. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> himself outlines a `` quadripartite provisional government,'' including the three coalition members and the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> side. This foursome would work on organizing general elections under international supervision and be backed by a four-party national army. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> appears to be key to the question of peace or war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He still enjoys widespread domestic popularity and by far the greatest backing internationally among the coalition's leaders. His latest maneuvers may be designed to get the fractious coalition solidly behind his negotiation efforts. Since his resignation, the two coalition partners have come begging for his return. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although the staunchest backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, stressed its support. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as `` a great patriot and experienced politician.'' Should the coalition sides ever compete for power in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> would need Peking's help in curbing the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.

 Trial opens Tuesday for a former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer accused of 16 counts of manslaughter by locomotive in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s worst fatal crash, a January 1987 accident that killed 16 people and injured more than 170. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was operating three linked <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives that prosecutors say ran a stop signal in <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 4, 1987, and ended up in front of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train that was traveling about 120 mph. Federal investigators say <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 33, failed to notice the stop signals because of drug and possibly alcohol use. Gates has denied smoking marijuana while operating the train. Testimony likely will focus on drug use, warning whistles and lights in the cab, and a series of approach signals to the switch where four tracks converge to two at the <LOCATION> Gunpowder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> railroad bridge crossing. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gates </ORGANIZATION>' trial on 16 counts of manslaughter. Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 1,000 fine. A county grand jury's indictment accuses <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, of `` gross negligence'' in the operation of the locomotives. Gates' charges fall under the same law normally used against people accused of negligence in automobile accidents. Prosecutors have said this is the first time the manslaughter by locomotive statute has been used in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> for 14 years, has said signals indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol. Blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed both <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and brakeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> had traces of marijuana in their bodies, but a recent court ruling in a different case could hamper prosecutors. The men were tested under a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rule requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a serious accident, but the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional. The railroad administration has said it will appeal and the ruling's effect on the trial remains uncertain. It stands as official precedent only in the circuit court's area, but may affect judicial thinking elsewhere. Even if the evidence is allowed, prosecutors must prove <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was impaired by the drugs, not just that he was using them. The trial could have implications for government control over train operators and for more than $ 294 million in civil suits arising from the crash. The railroad administration has said the crash already has helped it in its battle for jurisdiction over licensing and training of engineers. The federal government had no authority to punish <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> or <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, both of whom resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> has been granted immunity and is expected to testify that he and <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> fabricated a story to cover up their marijuana smoking on the train. Defense attorneys, according to chief public defender <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, will try to discredit <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> by pointing out he ran from the scene while <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> stayed to `` help save lives.'' Gates' attorneys also say they will present evidence that the track signals often malfunction, contrary to official statements.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stumped through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Monday from fast food restaurants to a retirement home appealing to voters to help him turn back the challenge from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in Tuesday's primary. `` I'm going to win tomorrow,'' he told a cheering crowd at <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` Believe me.'' He said in a television interview that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was making the same mistake <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself made in 1980 when he thought that winning the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses would give him the momentum to carry <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> soundly defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here eight years ago after being upset in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` I want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to do what it did in 1980. ... `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on the CBS Morning News. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is talking momentum and I'm talking issues on taxes and holding the line on the oil import fee and on presidential leadership, and I think it's working, so I want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to correct <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s mistakes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once strong lead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> polls has evaporated and polls now show the race as a virtual dead heat between the vice president and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who finished third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s proposal for a budget freeze `` a cop-out because it avoids the tough decisions.'' Speaking to elderly residents at a nursing home, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s plan a `` straitjacket'' that would limit Social Security cost-of-living increases to two percent. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has said a two percent <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION> cap is one possibility, but he has also suggested exempting Social Security from a freeze. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his own `` leadership freeze'' would achieve a balanced budget by 1993 without touching Social Secutiy or raising taxes. At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s side were large posters sitting on tripods that outlined the two plans in big letters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s theme all day was that he was a leader with experience who had been loyal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the last eight years. Crowds were sparse on this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday holiday morning as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, informally dressed in a blue ski jacket, made three breakfast stops.

But you see, in our family, loyalty is a strength. It's not all weakness. On the CBS Morning News, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` You ca n't live by the polls.

<TEXT>
 The government of the <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> tribal homeland has `` unleashed a reign of terror'' since a coup attempt was crushed last week, a prominent clergyman said Monday. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said hundreds of people from the home area of the coup leaders had been harassed or detained by soldiers of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. South African troops put down the coup hours after rebel soldiers in the nominally independent black territory seized its president and several top officials Wednesday. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, police spokesman in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, said 374 people had been detained in a continuing police operation. He would not comment on reports that most belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Party leader <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Malebane-Metsing </PERSON> was installed briefly as president during the 15-hour coup and remains at large. The Star newspaper in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> quoted sources it did not identify as saying five members of the homeland parliament from the party were taken from their homes Thursday. The highest-ranking soldier in the rebellion, Warrant Officer <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Phiri </PERSON>, and other alleged army rebels were charged with treason, which carries the death penalty, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said later that <PERSON> Phiri </PERSON> was not among the first 33 accused soldiers, who appeared in magistrate's court Monday in <LOCATION> Mmabatho </LOCATION>, capital of the homeland. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said those detained included members and officials of Malebane-Metsing's party abd people thought to have voted for it last year. He said a crackdown could provoke `` massive resistance that may result in a violent confrontation between the South African-backed bantustan -LRB- homeland -RRB- forces and the people of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>.'' Anti-apartheid activists condemn the homeland system as an attempt by white authorities to divide and weaken the black majority. About half <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks live in the 10 tribal homelands. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, with a population of 1.7 million people in seven separate parcels of land, is one of four homelands <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has designated as independent.

 Hundreds of snowbound motorists spent the night in their cars, on farms and in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armories when a blizzard clogged major roads for nearly 24 hours in southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, authorities said Monday. `` We had numerous people, a hundred would not be stretching it, who spent the night away from home on farms, in addition to the people who got to town and stayed there,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Muck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>. Less than an inch of snow actually fell, but wind blowing up to 45 mph picked up more than a foot of snow cover from the ground Sunday afternoon. The blowing snow cut visibility to zero and piled up in drifts up to seven feet high, <PERSON> Muck </PERSON> said. The State Patrol closed about a 100-mile stretch of Interstate 90 from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> border to 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> on Sunday afternoon and did not reopen it until late Monday morning, <PERSON> Muck </PERSON> said. Several other highways and county roads also were closed during that period, he said. There were numerous multi-vehicle accidents with injuries, but no fatalities were reported, he said. Elsewhere, snow blown by wind gusting to 60 mph cut visibility and forced <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> police to close a 99-mile stretch of Interstate 80 between <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION> for about four hours Monday morning. More than 300 motorists sought shelter in <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armories in <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muck </PERSON> said. The Worthington armory had travelers from as far away as <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, said National Guard 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Balster </PERSON>. `` We got 200 furniture blankets from U-Haul,'' <PERSON> Balster </PERSON> said. `` We got paper towels from <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION>. And people have brought in all kinds of food. There are sandwiches, chicken. One person just brought in two gallons of milk.'' `` We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the door for one room,'' said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorn </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>. Many people spent the night in motel lobbies and meeting rooms. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Luverne </LOCATION> and their three children _ ages 11 months, 5 years and 8 years _ were among those stranded on I-90 for hours before reaching the armory in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said traffic came to a standstill in near zero visibility Sunday afternoon about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>. `` We were on empty -LRB- gas tank -RRB- and I was really nervous about that and I told my husband we had to get to another car,'' she said in a telephone interview from the armory Monday morning. A couple from <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> offered to let them get in their car, `` so the five of us sat in the back of their car for almost nine hours, just keeping warm,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` They had a full tank.'' Temperatures in the area were in the single digits Sunday afternoon and 0 to 10 below zero overnight with a wind chill of 20 to 40 below, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Finally, plows were able to clear the opposite side of the highway. `` Around 1 a.m., we saw cars going in the opposite direction and one of them stopped,'' she said. `` It was two guys from <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- ... and they said they'd take us to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. And, with our kids, we wanted to get out of the car and to the armory in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> where we had some space.'' The family got to the armory around 3 a.m. The low visibility and high drifts kept plows and rescue vehicles off many roads until early Monday, said <PERSON> Lorren </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, another patrol dispatcher in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>. `` Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process,'' he said. `` You ca n't use strong enough language on them. They'll go out anyway and then they think the public officials should come out and rescue them when you ca n't go up and down the road. They get real perturbed when someone does n't go out there.'' Muck said it appeared that all motorists who stayed in their cars overnight made it out safely when the roads were reopened Monday morning. `` We've gotten no calls that anybody is missing,'' he said. Strong wind also hit sections of northwestern and western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> on Sunday, forcing the patrol to close I-94 at <LOCATION> Fergus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 10 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> for a time. But outside of southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the wind died down overnight in most areas of the state.

 Army troops will guard polling places during next month's national elections to prevent a repeat of the violence that left at least 100 people dead in last week's local balloting, President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said Monday. Anti-government leaders and at least two former members of <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s cabinet are urging voters to boycott the March 3 voting, contending that <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> is incapable of holding free and fair elections. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said the army, local police and other security will be deployed nationwide to prevent similar clashes next month. `` They have a special role to play in ensuring free and smooth exercise of the right of franchise by the voters,'' he told a meeting of the village defense forces at <LOCATION> Shafipur </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of here. Political leaders have demanded the army be posted during the polling. Main opposition leaders, however, have urged citizens to stay away from the polls. The opposition's four-month campaign against the government is led by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The two women have led several protest marhces and strikes to demand <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, a former army general who seized power in 1982, has refused to resign and dissolved parliament in December in the face of the opposition campaign. Two former cabinet ministers in <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s government, who resigned last month in protest, also have called for scrapping the elections. `` The forthcoming elections will push the country on to the path of dangerous confrontation,'' said former Health Minister <PERSON> Salahuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quader </PERSON> <PERSON> Choudhury </PERSON> and Information Minister <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which held 212 of the 330 seats in parliament, and 73 minor parties are taking part in the elections. The main opposition contends elections held under <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> in 1986 were rigged. Fear seems to be a key factor in whether people would risk a trip to the polls. While the government says 100 people died in the violence Wednesday, <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> claims 500 people were killed and 15,000 injured. <PERSON> Giasuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, 40, who was seriously injured last week, said he would `` never go for the voting ever in my life.'' Recovering in the <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` Hooliganism, bombings and killings have destroyed elections as a means to change the government. I shall never be a party to such an exercise.'' A politicial commentator, <PERSON> Amanullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON>, said last week's violence showed the government did not have the resources to keep the peace at polling places Opposition leaders say the government may make mass arrests before the national elections. `` The government has two options: either postpone the polls or go for a direct crackdown on us,'' said <PERSON> Dilip </PERSON> <PERSON> Barua </PERSON>, a member of the eight-party alliance led by <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>. The election commission had to reschedule the local contests. The commission said balloting would be held at 4,414 voting centers on March 16.

 Fear of retribution pervades this Arab village, which the Israeli army sealed off after four Palestinian youths claimed soldiers buried them alive with a bulldozer. `` Seven men and four women dug up the kids,'' said <PERSON> Rasmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, a teacher who reported seeing everything from his home on Feb. 5. `` They used their bare hands. Two of them were completely buried and two had their heads sticking out, their mouths full of mud. `` Usually this is a very quiet village. A lot of people worked with the Israelis. But because they -LRB- the villagers -RRB- have talked to the press, there is a feeling that the authorities will take revenge.'' The army detained two soldiers Sunday and an official investigation began Monday. Roads into the community of 4,000 people are blocked with huge piles of dirt, and villagers said the only two telephones in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> have been cut off. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, military commander of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said: `` Even in my worst dreams, I would never imagine such a thing even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most awful things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens.'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said on army radio a sergeant-major from the military government and two or three other soldiers were involved and would be brought to trial. Military sources said the army did not learn of the alleged burial until a week after it happened. `` I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' said one of the four young men, 19-year-old <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON>, soon after a military investigator questioned him on Monday. `` I dream about it all the time.'' <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> was interrogated in a white police van parked on the muddy road just outside the village entrance. He and the others claim <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers seized them after a demonstration in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> that became violent, as have so many since riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He said the soldiers beat and kicked them and forced them to remove rocks from the main road. Finally, they say, they were ordered to lie on the ground and a bulldozer covered them with 12 to 16 inches of mud and dirt. <PERSON> Assam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON>, 20, from the same family as <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON>, said he spent eight days in the hospital after the burial recovering from cuts and bruises on both legs. On Monday, he was in bed at his home, surrounded by friends and family members. He said four soldiers had burst into the house and arrested him. `` They took me to the entrance of the village, beat me with clubs and kicked me,'' he said, and more soldiers brought the three other youths. `` They told us to take the stones from the road,'' he said. `` After they were removed, they told us to move them five meters farther.'' About 40 soldiers were at the scene under the command of an officer, <PERSON> Assam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> said. He said a Jewish settler also was present, and accused the settler of complicity. `` The officer took us one at a time and beat us,'' he said. All four say they were ordered to lie on the ground, face down, and the bulldozer covered them. `` I did n't know what was going to happen,'' <PERSON> Assam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> said. `` I thought they would arrest us. I thought they would arrest me and take me to jail.'' The soldiers left quickly and neighbors ran to the scene and began digging the young men out. After interrogation Monday, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> emerged from the police van helped by two villagers. Both his hands were bandaged to midforearm. <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON> said the Jewish settler had kicked him in the groin and incited the soldiers to bury the four Palestinians. He said another of the young men, 25-year-old <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelmajid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, speaks Hebrew and heard the settler tell the soldiers: `` Well done.'' Villagers claimed an official from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military government told the muktar, or village leader, the piles of dirt would be removed from the roads when the village apologized for the stone-throwing that started the trouble. Residents of <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON>, a nearby Jewish settlement, expressed shock. `` I heard about it last night and I said it can not be,'' said a settler who guards the gate and would identify himself only as <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- the army -RRB- will punish them.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Binun </PERSON>, another settler, said: `` We have a basic argument with our -LRB- Arab -RRB- cousins about whose place this is, but we do n't have to take the law into our own hands.

 We others in my generation went under in the machinery of war, in fear and in the effort to survive. In the dreadful run of a war, only one thing is certain: death knows no fronts. I say that because at the end of a war, there are always the wounds, the widows and the families without fathers. Above all, let us never forget that the systematic and perfected destruction of European Jews by the NS -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- regime was added to the horrors of this war. It must be a holy duty for us to do everything so that the crimes of this time are never repeated again. The war years were a bitter period of learning which I have not spoken much about and did not want to speak much about. Perhaps that was a mistake, but it was certainly not a strategy of covering up. We were all happy then, when the war was over, and tried together to build a better and more humane world. I drew one lesson from this time: I wanted to help assure that there would never be war again. I wanted to work for peace. I was able to do this as an ambassador and foreign minister of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and as secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years. My fellow citizens: You can measure, on the basis of my life since 1945, whether or not I have overcome the bitter apprenticeship of the war. You can judge for yourselves whether your president is the young lieutenant _ or even the distorted picture of this officer of the Wehrmacht _ or whether your president is a man who, for decades of his life, worked for justice, tolerance and peace. I ask you to form your own judgment. My Austrians: In the course of the new discussion the question was also put about my premature departure from this office of federal president. I want to take a stand in all clarity: You, my dear Austrians, have elected me federal president with a convincing majority in a secret and direct election for six years. Thus it is no longer a matter of the man <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. In view of the slanders, I have often asked myself in the last two years, whether I should carry on all that. It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an election result can not be subsequently corrected. It is, however, also a question of justice and fairness toward the person, as well as the respect for the highest office in the state. A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations. We certainly do n't want such methods to be used against other democratic institutions in other situations. Let us not endager the self-respect and self-consciousness of our state. It is a question of belief in our fatherland. I see my duty as president in ensuring the functioning of the basic principles and the institutions of our republic. It can not serve this duty if the president retreats in the face of outside pressure and so puts into question the meaning of democratic decisions. Such a step could become the beginning of a development which would bring new and much more serious difficulties. Since the beginning of my term in office, I bound myself to the thought of reconciliation and cooperation and continue to profess these principles very deeply _ despite all the intolerance of my opponents. At the same time, I would like to make clear that I will decisively confront things I can not be expected to bear. There must be no doubt about one thing, only if the polemics stop in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> itself, can we expect the debate abroad to calm down. Therefore I appeal to all Austrians, in particular to all politically responsible -LRB- leaders -RRB- in our homeland not to pour oil onto the fire and to put the interests of the state before party political interests. The consciousness of the state must always be stronger than that which may divide us. My dear countrymen, you can trust me as you trusted two years ago when you elected me as federal president. Those people who spread intolerance and discord can not be allowed to prevail, but rather the great majority of those for whom it is a question of our homeland, of our common <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. If we want this, we will do it together and can form the future with new strength.

<TEXT>
 A leftist guerrilla group that has launched the biggest rebel offensive in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has claimed responsibility for the weekend kidnap of eight mayors and three reporters, police said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION>, said the abductions are linked with nationwide March 13 mayoral elections, according to Gov. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON> of northern Norte de Santander state, who spoke in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. The radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>'s station in northeast <LOCATION> Cucuta </LOCATION> city reported that a person claiming to be with the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> said in an anonymous telephone call Saturday that the kidnapped people would be used to carry messages to the government. The kidnap victims would be released soon, the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> reportedly told <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. The rebel group was commemorating the 22nd anniversary Monday of the death of its founder, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was killed in a battle with army troops. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was an admirer of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. The insurgent group still looks toward <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> for ideological leadership. All eight mayors and three reporters were kidnapped in northeast <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> between Friday night and Sunday afternoon, the police statement said. The last three mayors to be kidnapped on Saturday night and early Sunday, were <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Chitaga </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carcasi </LOCATION>, towns in <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION> state. Kidnapped earlier Saturday were the mayors of two more Norte de Santander towns, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of Convencion and <PERSON> Ricaute </PERSON> <PERSON> Paez </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ocana </PERSON>. Also kidnapped early Saturday was <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morales </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION> state. He was released hours later. Kidnapped Friday were <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Solano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Aguachica </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Cesar </LOCATION> state, and <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Numa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Teorama </LOCATION> in Norte de Santander. A mayoral candidate in the Norte de Santander town of <LOCATION> Gambita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, disappeared and his family fears he, too, was kidnapped by the guerrillas, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Cucuta </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped two <LOCATION> Cucuta </LOCATION> radio reporters and a correspondent for the daily <ORGANIZATION> Vanguardia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucaramanga </ORGANIZATION>, the police said. Police in <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION> raided an <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> hideout Sunday night and arrested six people, Col. <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, the chief of national police in that northeast city, said in an interview with RCN. The police found 776 pounds of dynamite and a car bomb that was being assembled, the colonel said. The <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> began an offensive last month, setting off bombs, attacking towns and ambushing army patrols. The drive keyed on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s main oil pipeline that carries 215,000 barrels of crude a day from the <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limon </ORGANIZATION> field in northeast <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION> state. The field, along the Venezuelan border, is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> company of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The 500-mile pipeline goes to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. The <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> blew up the pipeline 12 times in the last two weeks. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> had to suspend its oil exports of 180,000 barrles a day for three weeks because of the bomb damage. The <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> also set off a car bomb Feb. 5 in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, damaging <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s Colombian offices and injuring two guards.

 Tens of thousands of documents were stolen from a U.S.-run Nazi records center, prosecutors said Monday, but there was no evidence to back a report they were used to blackmail former members of the Nazi party. <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said investigators suspect the deputy director of the Nazi archives was involved in the theft of Nazi-era documents from the American-run <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Document Center. `` Our investigation so far indicates that the documents were stolen for profit,'' he said. `` There is no evidence to indicate suggestions that they were used for blackmail.'' <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON> said investigators suspect tens of thousands of documents were removed from the center, a former telephone tapping center for the Gestapo, or Nazi secret police. The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgenpost </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, in its Tuesday editions, said West German authorities have been told for years of suspicions that documents were being taken from the center. An unidentified dealer offered British historian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, an expert on the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era, documents that allegedly came from the center nearly a decade ago, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> told West German authorities of the incident, the paper said; the officials launched an investigation, but the probe was later dropped due to a lack of evidence. The newspaper cited no sources for its report, which was given in advance to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON> acknowledged an investigation into missing documents at the center was begun in 1983 but dropped for lack of progress in 1986. He said that inquiry was resumed last summer after an anonymous tip to authorities. The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgenpost </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that 80,000 files were missing from the center and former <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> paid millions to keep their pasts secret and the documents from being made public. It said many documents contained `` secret information about leading figures in the Third Reich.'' In its Tuesday report, the newspaper said those blackmailed included lawyers, doctors and artists who belonged to Nazi-approved professional organizations during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON> said prosecutors believe the missing documents may have been sold to dealers and collectors around the world for considerable sums. `` There is evidence that some of these documents were sold for sums of up to 5,000 marks -LRB- $ 2,900 -RRB- apiece,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON> said several West German dealers are targets of the investigation. He said authorities recovered about 1,500 documents, including a letter from <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s doctor and correspondence from high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leaders. He did not say where the documents were found, but <ORGANIZATION> Morgenpost </ORGANIZATION> said some documents were seized during a police raid on a <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> dealer. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Homan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, could not be reached for comment on Monday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holiday. On Sunday, he confirmed a criminal investigation into missing documents was under way and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were cooperating with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prosecutors.

<HEAD>Sends Shudder Through Buildings In Las Vegas, 105 Miles Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first announced nuclear weapon test of 1988 rocked the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert Monday and sent a shudder through some high-rise buildings in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, 105 miles from ground zero. The device produced an explosive punch up to 11 times as powerful as the atomic bomb that devastated <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. The test was conducted three weeks after a team of Soviet nuclear scientists visited the top secret <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site _ a visit that could lead to the monitoring of each other's tests and a possible test ban. And it came the same day the second round of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on nuclear testing began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with the Soviets calling for agreement by June on anti-cheating provisions. That would permit ratification of two superpower treaties limiting the yield of test blasts. The test, code named <LOCATION> Kernville </LOCATION>, was delayed two hours because of unfavorable wind conditions, then another 10 minutes because of technical problems, according to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON>. The experiment was buried 1,800 feet below the surface of <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, about 105 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Managers of tall buildings in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> were warned in advance not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of the blast, a standard warning when tests are close to the upper test limit of 150 kilotons of explosive force. Motion was recorded on DOE seismographs at the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the Regency Towers Apartments here, and <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON>'s Castle in <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, southwest of the test site. A telephone operator at the high-rise <ORGANIZATION> Fitzgerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in downtown Las Vegas said hanging plants swayed in the seconds after the 10:10 a.m. PST detonation. But a controller at McCarran International Airport control tower reported feeling no motion. Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said she felt no ground motion at the control point, 41 miles from ground zero. The blast measured 5.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Everything was fully contained. That makes it a successful test,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said the test was `` weapons-related'' and sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It brought to 675 the total number of announced blasts at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site since testing began there in 1951. It was the 470th test announced by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the limited test ban treaty of August 1963, she said. The most recent previous test was Mission Cyber, fired on Dec. 2, 1987. There were 15 announced tests last year and 12 announced tests in 1986. Not all tests are announced for security reasons, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> says.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech Shuts Down Nuke Reactor Amid Safety Concerns,
Controvery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> shut down its controversy-plagued nuclear reactor Monday and the school's president said it would remain idle at least until safety concerns are resolved and might never be restarted. Tech President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON> said the school was voluntarily suspending all reactor operations not already halted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, pending full <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approval of the school's reactor operations The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> already has suspended irradiation experiments at the 24-year-old reactor on <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>'s intown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> campus, following a mishap resulting in some apparent contamination in the reactor building last summer. `` This move does not in any way reflect concern on my part with the safety of the reactor operations now or in the immediate past,'' <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It does reflect my belief that normal, safe and efficient operations of this research facility are becoming increasingly difficult with the publicity ...'' <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON>, who characterized the reactor's troubles as `` basically internal staff problems,'' said the reactor will not resume operations until its staff is upgraded and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> lifts the irradiation experiment ban and favorably reviews safety procedures. He said a permanent shutdown of the troubled reactor operation is `` certainly a possibility.'' `` Continuing operation of the reactor is dependent on the operating and political costs incurred by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON> also defended last Thursday's firing of two reactor staff physicists who had complained about safety problems. Tech had already decided to `` upgrade the professional quality'' of the reactor staff, he said, and the two technicians were dismissed as part of that effort. The two workers were among three members of the health physics staff directly responsible for reactor safety, <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON> said. The third, a manager, has been transferred. The irradiation experiments which the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> ordered halted constituted about 20 percent of the work done at the reactor. Much of the reactor's other operations are conducted for `` non-Georgia Tech interests,'' such as other universities and for medical researchers, <PERSON> Crecine </PERSON> said. Shutdown of the reactor `` will have an impact'' at <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, where about 100 undergraduate students participate in nuclear engineering classes utilizing the facility, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> last week blasted <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, saying safety conditions at the reactor had not improved significantly since last May, when the school said it would correct numerous problems at the facility. `` Lack of adequate management'' at the reactor apparently jeopardized the safety of workers and the public, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said in a report.

 Heat and hot water have returned after long absence to the rundown <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> apartment building where the landlord is serving a 15-day sentence of house arrest, tenants said Monday. But no other repairs are apparent, tenants said. Landlord <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, 76, entered the building Friday to serve his sentence for failing to correct housing violations. He also was ordered to apply $ 137,900 in fines to repairs of more than 400 violations that include roach and mice infestation, lack of heat, flooding and crumbling ceilings. `` The first night -LRB- of his stay -RRB- heat was on all night. I had to get up and open my windows,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a fourth-floor resident in the building. But `` nothing is being done to my apartment,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who cited numerous problems within her apartment. She also said she has n't seen any repairs being done to the building itself or in the hallway. But apartment 5C was replastered and painted before Gross moved in with two bodyguards. Angry tenants and a banner reading `` Welcome Reptile'' greeted Gross when he arrived. An ankle bracelet Gross is wearing lets authorities know he is staying in the apartment because it sends an electronic signal to a transmitter if he wanders more than 100 feet from it. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, tenant association president, said residents had been unable to talk to Gross about problems in the building and feared the heat will disappear once he does. Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> had charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on only 10 to 12 apartments. `` When you subtract that from 113 apartments, you'll see the real McCoy.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet generals said Monday the experience of the Afghan war will not keep the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from supporting other pro-Kremlin governments around the world. The generals appeared at a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to mark the 70th anniversary of the Soviet armed forces. They refused to say how many Soviet soldiers have been killed in Afghan fighting since December 1979, but Western observers have estimated Soviet dead may number about 10,000. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a week ago <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants to start withdrawing its soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by May 15 if U.N.-sponsored talks can reach a final agreement this spring. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers could be out of the country in 10 months. Army Gen. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanovsky </PERSON> said Monday the experiences of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would provide tactical lessons for the Soviet military. He said most Soviet casualties in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> came not in traditional combat, but from `` mines in the roads, shots from around the corner and surprise attacks.'' Col. Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON>, deputy head of political administration of the armed forces, said the Soviet military is drawing lessons from the stalemate with Afghan guerrillas. But he added, `` This does not put in doubt our readiness to provide moral, diplomatic, political and other forms of help to a friendly regime.'' Asked if sending Soviet soldiers to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a mistake, he said: `` It was an act of assistance based on a request of a legitimate government. Therefore it was not a mistake. It was the fulfillment of our duty.'' Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, oversaw the replacement of one pro-Soviet government with another, and since then have been engaged in fighting the anti-Marxist, Islamic guerrillas. The guerrillas are backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, among others. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have said the Soviet soldiers can not be withdrawn until military aid to the insurgents is cut off. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviets would make no demands about the composition of a future government, putting the role of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s pro-Soviet government in doubt. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s minister of state for foreign affairs, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, left his country for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Monday for talks with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on reaching an accord on the Afghan issue. He said the recent shuttle by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement on Soviet troop withdrawal plans and a visit to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> had brought the Afghan issue forward. It was not clear if <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>'s departure for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was prompted by a sharpening of differences between the stands taken by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the mujahedeen guerrillas. The Pakistanis, who represent the guerrillas in the U.N.-sponsored <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, have agreed that some Communist figures could participate in a future interim government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have refused such a compromise and have insisted on an all-mujahedeen-run government.

 Most of the presidential candidates in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary were struggling not just to win, but to avoid losing so badly that it could virtually eliminate them from the race. Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who finished a dismal fifth in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, managed a joke about the precarious existence of his campaign. `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> frankly did not start out as a household name, and some would say he'll end this race as not a household name,'' the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor said at one stop Sunday night. But for most of his rivals and for those at the back of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pack, the prospect that the nation's first primary could also be their last was no joking matter.

But a primary defeat here would evoke the memory of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s loss in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary four years ago _ an outcome that ensured a long, brutal struggle to the convention and a nomination that proved worthless. Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> campaigned knowing they had a ticket to Super Tuesday, the next major campaign three weeks hence across the South.

But there's no such assurance for Democrats <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who need badly to beat somebody. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, a winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, seemed to need a second place finish here to sustain a candidacy badly in debt _ and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> needed the same. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, needed not only to win, but by a respectable margin. Republicans <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> needed to beat each other. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> told a crowd at a Jewish temple in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> Sunday night, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> this Tuesday has within its grasp the power of life and death over my candidacy. `` There are people who tell you my candidacy is over. They're the same people who tell you your vote does n't matter,'' said <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who fielded questions for more than an hour and even then seemed reluctant to go `` I'm willing to stay here till the sunrise, whether it comes at the usual time or <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> makes it a little earlier,'' he joked. What kind of finish would it take to allow <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> to stay in the race? `` We're looking for a reason to hang on,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said over the weekend. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s campaign has put up some of its computers for sale back home in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Campaign spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said they were surplus now that the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses are finished, and did not signify an impending campaign shutdown. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> went into <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses saying all he needed to do was to beat <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to establish himself as the conservatives' alternative He failed to do that, so how could he withstand failing to beat <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> here too? `` I'm going South in any case,'' du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> insisted. In <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> on Monday, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> dismissed the pundits' prognostications `` Oh, you remember pundits. They're the ones who told us President <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> would soon be taking the oath of office, that President <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> had this nomination under control, that <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was facing the biggest election victory'' here four years ago, he said. `` I dont know where all those poitical pundits are today but they ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run for cover tomorrow,'' said du Pont.

<HEAD>Sheriffs Embarrassed By Arrests, Convictions Among Colleagues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A six-year series of criminal trials has left the public with an image of the county sheriff as an uneducated redneck in reflector sunglasses who does n't mind bending and even breaking the law, officials say. `` The sheriffs do n't talk about it much publicly, but I think it's embarrassing to them when these other sheriffs get in trouble with the law,'' said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` They talk privately about how dang stupid it is,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said last week after <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges he sexually abused inmates in his jail in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The string of arrests has left other officials wondering how to prevent further tarnishing of their `` Walking Tall'' image. The 1973 movie about <PERSON> McNairy </PERSON> County Sheriff <PERSON> Buford </PERSON> <PERSON> Pusser </PERSON>'s fight against crime depicted the Southern sheriff as a courageous, tough individual who risked his life for law and order <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> is among 12 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> sheriffs or ex-sheriffs indicted on criminal charges since 1982. Most of the cases stemmed from charges they sold confiscated drugs or received bribes to protect drug runners. Officials say the arrests point to the need for changes in the way voters choose their county's top law enforcement leader. The sheriff's association _ anxious to boost its image and performance in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> _ voted in 1986 to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to set stricter standards for anyone seeking the office. But the bill was rejected 50-42 by the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, the only requirements to be a sheriff in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is to be at least 18 years old, live in the county you run for office in _ and be alive,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The bill would have required sheriffs to hold at least a high school diploma and to have lived in the county for 18 months preceding an election or appointment. It also would have set training standards and require that a candidate for sheriff not have a felony record. State Rep. <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wix </PERSON>, a former sheriff and sponsor of the legislation, contends such standards are needed because of the delicate balance of duties entrusted to sheriffs. In the more populated counties, the sheriff is considered mainly an administrator. But in smaller ones, they must be administrator, investigator and jailer, among other things. `` It was the hardest job I ever had,'' <PERSON> Wix </PERSON> said of his six years as Sumner County Sheriff. He says the public should remember that the days of the `` good ol' boy sheriff'' _ when the county's top law enforcement officer was elected on the basis of popularity than qualifications _ are slowly dying as populations increase and voters demand more. `` It's changing little by little,'' he said. `` The bad sheriffs are getting weeded out, and the good sheriffs are running on their record and getting re-elected.'' Despite support for the bill from all but two of the state's 95 sheriffs, <PERSON> Wix </PERSON> says he has no plans to reintroduce it immediately. Lawmakers were hesitant to tamper with the system, <PERSON> Wix </PERSON> said. `` They felt that anybody should be able to run for public office _ regardless of their education,'' he said. `` Even the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't have to have a high school degree.''

 Heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said Monday he will donate $ 50,000 for the college education of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who says she was the victim of a racially motivated attack near her <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> also announced plans for a foundation to aid young crime victims. The foundation would be supported by an annual fundraiser, possibly including a boxing exhibition by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said details would be worked out by boxing promoter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who joined <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> at a news conference and promised to match the champion's pledge of $ 50,000. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, his wife and King visited <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> at her home for several hours Saturday. She told the boxer, `` I always wanted to go out with you,'' and gave him a handwritten note of thanks, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. The foundation `` starts with her, but it's open to any kids that are abused,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. `` They need the necessities to make it in this world. That means education.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, a 16-year-old high school student in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, says she was assaulted, raped, and smeared with racial epithets in December by six white men, one of whom allegedly flashed a police badge. She was found stuffed in a garbage bag with `` nigger'' and `` KKK'' etched in charcoal across her breasts. She had refused to cooperate with investigators on the advice of her lawyers, black activists <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. But after a meeting with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> last week, they said they were willing to let her cooperate with an investigation headed by state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. They are scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> did not comment Monday on the criminal investigation, but commented, `` it looks as if no one's going to get caught'' because residents of such a small town might be reluctant to talk with authorities. Last week comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Essence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> announced a $ 25,000 reward for information about her case. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> denied a published report that he had volunteered to act as Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s personal escort. But the boxer said she asked him, `` Are you gon na beat people up for me?'' `` I'll do whatever you want me to,'' he said he responded.

 Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> may be fifth in line for the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> throne, but he did n't risk being late Monday on his first day at work as a theater production assistant. He arrived 10 minutes early at his new job, which appropriately is at the Palace Theater. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, who abandoned a career in the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marines </LOCATION> last year, arrived with a confident grin on his face, a royal bodyguard at his side and, most importantly, a box of teabags tucked under his arm. Production assistant is the most junior job, and the 23-year-old prince will be expected to perform the most humdrum of backstage errands, including making tea for his new co-workers at composer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s Really Useful Theater Co. Asked if he was looking forward to his first day on the job, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> said only: `` Of course I am.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, the youngest son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is the first member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family to choose the theater as a career, according to Buckingham Palace. Most of the monarch's male relatives select a military career. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, served in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in World War II and his other sons followed him: <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> throne, has commanded a mine sweeper and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was a helicopter pilot in the 1982 <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> arrived in a limousine at the Palace Theater in the heart of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, casually dressed in a blue sweater and tweed jacket. Police with sniffer dogs had earlier searched the theater. The Palace, which houses the offices of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s company, is currently showing `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' the hit musical based of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s novel. The Really Useful Theater Company is behind a string of hit musicals, including `` Cats'' and `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' <PERSON> LLoyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> a job after the prince resigned from the Royal Marines in January 1987, four months into a year-long course to become a commando officer. Fellow marines said he was ranked in the top 10 of his class, but <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news reports at the time called him a wimp and said his father was furious. <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, the company's executive director, said when <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>'s hiring was announced last month: `` The prince wo n't be treated as a member of the royal family but as an employee. `` He has said he wants to be treated as a worker, that is his understanding of the job. He has a lot to learn and we have plenty of work for him.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>'s salary has not been disclosed. The bachelor prince lives with his parents at Buckingham Palace and receives about $ 34,900 a year from the government. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> studied history for three years at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and took part in amateur theater productions. He is patron of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and the 1988 Festival of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 A three-week-old boy underwent more than 10 hours of heart transplant surgery in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Monday and a week-old infant was upgraded from critical to serious condition, 24 hours after he was given a new heart in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Both infants were born with hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a lethal underdevelopment of the heart. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>, born Jan. 25, entered the operating room at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> around midnight and emerged at 10:15 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. He was the youngest heart transplant patient at that hospital. At <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Christoffer </PERSON>, son of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> family, received a new heart in a 5-hour operation performed Sunday by Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, the surgeon who transplanted a baboon heart into the infant girl known as Baby Fae in 1984. `` <PERSON> Christoffer </PERSON>'s condition was upgraded this morning from critical to serious,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the hospital 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The boy had been in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>'s neo-natal intensive care unit for six days, three of them on life support, before the transplant surgery. In both cases, the identity of the donor was not released. And <PERSON> Christoffer </PERSON>'s family asked that no more information be released, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. Doctors in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> could not immediately assess the chances that <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>'s operation would succeed, said Miss <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was in critical condition, which is normal immediately after transplant surgery, she said. `` The operation was a very delicate procedure to perform,'' said Miss <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. `` Right now the major concern is with overall function of the organ.

<TEXT>
 Composer <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> was fondly remembered by friends Monday as a sentimental and caring man whose classic tunes from the musicals `` Gigi'' and `` My Fair Lady'' will be immortal. <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON>, whose partnership with lyricist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> produced such romantic standards as `` I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,'' `` If Ever I Would Leave You'' and `` On the Street Where You Live,'' died Sunday at <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> here of a heart attack. He was 86. `` His music will be immortal,'' said comedian <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, his friend of 45 years. `` The world will always hear him speak, feel his emotions, for he has only put on a shroud that makes him invisible. He broke hearts on Valentine's Day. But perhaps, at last, he found his Camelot.'' <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> will deliver the eulogy this week during a memorial service here. The comedian said <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> was much loved by members of this exclusive desert community, and was also friends with area residents <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>. `` I'm very sad. He was an adorable person under his very rough manner,'' said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> actress <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, who starred in `` <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>.'' `` I was quite fond of him. He looked a bit like <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> playing a gangster ... When I first met him he put me off. Then I realized he was a softy.'' `` He was a very sentimental and gentle man. He was always happy and never gloomy,'' <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> added. The Lerner-Loewe team enchanted audiences with tunes from such classic musicals as `` <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>,'' `` Camelot,'' `` My Fair Lady'' and `` Brigadoon.'' Some of the other songs the team produced were `` Almost Like Being in Love,'' `` I Could Have Danced All Night,'' and `` Get Me to the Church on Time.'' Actor-dancer <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who starred in the film version of `` Brigadoon,'' praised <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> as `` a fine musician who did great things.'' `` I was lucky to do ` Brigadoon,' because it was a singer's picture,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> recalled `` But <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> helped make it a dancer's picture with my small Irish tenor called upon to sing all those wonderful songs. He was a fantastic man, an eccentric and an adventurer.'' <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON>, died Sunday at 1:51 p.m. at <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he had been admitted Wednesday for chest pains. <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> had strong ties to the hospital, donating most of the funds to build the <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loewe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavilion </ORGANIZATION> in 1971, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcklay </PERSON>, the hospital's acting chief executive officer. <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> also donated royalties from some of his songs to the pediatric unit, which are used each year to buy Christmas gifts and toys for sick children there, he added. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> died in 1986. His widow, actress <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, on Monday performing in a revival of `` My Fair Lady.' ` `` He was just a wonderful generous man who wrote the most extraordinary, beautiful music. I'm pleased to be performing ` My Fair Lady' on stage in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> so that I can celebrate his life by singing his music tonight,'' she said. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON>'s partnership began with a one-night flop in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in 1942. They parted bitterly after `` Camelot,'' their last Broadway hit, in 1960. After a 1973 reunion for the Broadway production of `` <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>,'' originally written in 1958 as a movie, they remained friends. <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> was born June 10, 1901, to a distinguished musical family in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. He began piano lessons as a boy and at 13 was the youngest pianist to appear as soloist with the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Symphony. <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> was 15 when he published `` Katrina,'' a song that sold 2 million copies on sheet music in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1924 and later wandered the country prospecting for gold, herding cattle, delivering mail on horseback and teaching riding at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> resort. As a bantamweight boxer in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, he won eight of nine professional bouts. In 1931, <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> married <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerline </PERSON>, whom he divorced after 26 years together with no children. He has no survivors. He began his collaboration with <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> after accepting an offer from a stock company in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to adapt a farce, `` The Patsy.'' <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>'s fascination with the Scottish writer Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> led to the team's first hit show, `` Brigadoon,'' and their first hit song, `` Almost Like Being in Love,'' in 1947. <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> went their separate ways for a time, but reunited in 1951 to produce `` Paint Your Wagon.'' Next came `` My Fair Lady'' in 1956, a musical adaptation of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s `` Pygmalion.'' The cast included <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and ran for 2,717 performances. It won <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> the first of two Tony Awards and the 1964 film adaptation won several Academy Awards, including best picture. The team also produced a film musical, `` <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>,'' based on a novella by <PERSON> Colette </PERSON>, in 1958. It was the first film to win nine Academy Awards, including an Oscar to <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> as co-writer of the title song. The next project was `` Camelot.'' Critics were hard on the musical when it arrived in 1960 but it was greatly loved by President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whose short-lived administration was later dubbed Camelot by admirers.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Monday that the Republican presidential race will come down to him and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, whose campaign he derided as one of `` pain, sacrifice and bitter medicine.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said one-time <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign is losing ground, based in part on his performance in Sunday night's Republican debate `` I'm saving second -LRB- place -RRB- for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said at a news conference on the banks of the rushing <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. `` I would n't be surprised if we surprised a lot of people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and surprised a lot of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, generally believed to be in a tight race for first place, as well as <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has been gaining ground since his surprising finish ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he believes the Republican race ultimately will come down to a contest between himself and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ `` a pain, sacrifice and bitter medicine <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign versus a growth, hope, opportunity, progressive, populist, conservative <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> campaign. We're going to win the nomination of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> television ads accusing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of having a history of raising taxes should be pulled off the air. `` It is consumer fraud for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has gone along with every major tax increase of the 1980s, to accuse <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of being a tax increaser,'' he said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> never saw a tax they did n't hike.'' During a Sunday night debate, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> assailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for saying `` give peace a chance'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` That was the rallying cry of the liberal Democrats -LRB- in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to kill aid for freedom fighters'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. He said peace alone should not be the goal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy. `` There's peace in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, peace in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and peace in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but there is no democracy,'' he said. `` That facist regime in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> needs to be replaced with democracy and freedom, and I was embarrassed that the vice president would make that type of statement that sells short the cause of democracy and freedom in this hemisphere.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, shifting his focus to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said Monday he was gaining on the leader and looked for `` a real surprise'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s leadoff presidential primary. Dropping his attacks on <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, with whom he was dueling for second place, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> sought to cut into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support and contended he could win outright. Polls have shown the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor holding a two-to-one margin over <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` I think increasingly the race is between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and me,'' the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator said. `` What is clear now is we have moved into second place in contention with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> stood on a snowy roadside at the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border and pleaded for voters to `` assert their independence'' and not back <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> merely because he is a neighboring governor. `` There is a difference between me and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ a difference in experience, a difference in commitment,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> a week ago after finishing a close second behind <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. With his campaign in debt, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> went on the attack with television commercials that accused <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of flip-flopping on a range of positions. He dropped those ads on Sunday and replaced them with commercials that portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a colorless bureaucrat lacking in vision. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> stuck to his theme of being an unrepentant liberal as he tried to chip away at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s lead on the final day of the campaign. He cited education, jobs, long-term care for the elderly and infirm, arms control and foreign policy. `` Where is the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> program for long-term care?'' he asked. `` We need more than talk of a miracle,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in a deliberate reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim to have engineered a `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' economic turnaround. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is widely believed to need to finish second in order to continue a viable campaign. He acknowledged his vulnerability even while predicting a good showing. `` I think it is tightening,'' he said. `` I think there is a possibility of a real surprise come tomorrow.'' Does that mean you could win, he was asked. `` That is correct,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. But he added later: `` We have to do well in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and I am going to do well. If we were to do poorly, we would have to re-evaluate.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, campaigning hours before Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary, pledged Monday to pass national legislation to curb acid rain and take the issue to an international summit. `` The time for research has passed,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said at a rally at the Statehouse. `` The time for procrastination is over. It's time for action now.'' The former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor told reporters after the rally he anticipates doing better than expected in the state's leadoff primary. Asked what he would consider a strong showing, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who has been consistently in the single digits in polls, said, `` I honestly do n't know. It depends in some measure on what the prognosticators and commentators have to say.'' `` I'm anticipating a strong showing and a surprise, but I ca n't put a number on it,'' he said <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> was the only candidate to show up at the rally sponsored in part by the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, who last week gave <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> the highest marks among the candidates for his efforts to clean up the environment. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said that when he thinks of acid rain he remembers the `` immortal words of a president called <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who once stood up in a public place and proclaimed that it's trees that cause pollution.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, once was greeted by a sign on a pine tree on a college campus that said: `` Chop me down before I kill again.'' The `` silent tragedy'' of dying forests and lakes is not confined to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> described his own fight as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor to demand that two copper-smelting plants that were causing acid rain obey environmental laws. When they refused, he went to the legislature and eventually shut them down, he said. But afterwards, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` I looked over my shoulder and 60 miles across the border in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> they were building a copper smelter which, the day it opened, would erase all the gains we had made in 10 years of fighting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.'' When he sought help form the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to stop the plant, he claimed, `` They said that's none of our business.'' Environmental problems `` are our problems but they're also the planet's problems,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. He pledged that as president he will put environmental issues such as acid rain on the agenda of an international summit.

<HEAD>Soviet Verification Procedures Insufficient for Arms Talks, U.S.
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has told the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that verification procedures worked out for medium-range missiles will not suffice for the strategic arms talks that begin again this week, senior arms control adviser <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said Monday. `` We are calling for tough measures which will assure that we can verify Soviet compliance,'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The text of the speech was released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Soviets, he said, can expedite progress on strategic arms reductions by abandoning their effort to link the reductions to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pursuit of Star Wars technology. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> accused the Soviets of delaying tactics, which he said are jeopardizing reaching an agreement on strategic arms in time for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in late spring or early summer. `` They appear to believe delaying tactics will reward them with a START treaty imbalanced in their favor,'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said. `` I hope they will recognize that their intransigence is only dimming hopes for an agreement before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting.'' Even with the tough verification procedures approved two months ago as part of the treaty banning medium-range missile, <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said, `` it would be misleading to suggest we are on a roll toward a START agreement.'' `` We are concerned that the Soviets' heavy reliance on very large ICBMs may give them a sense of confidence that they could gain a critical advantage by striking first,'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said. By seeking a limit that permanently reduces both the number and the proportion of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the Soviet armory, he said, `` we are asking the Soviets in effect to renounce any motion that nuclear war is winnable, even if initiated pre-emptively.''

 Supporters of a presidential primary for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state said Monday they fear the measure has been killed by pressure from the two political parties and will die without coming to a vote. The bill, which would allow voters to decide whether to scrap the complicated caucus system, remained bottled up in the House Rules Committee on Monday. The two main backers of a primary, Republican Secretary of State <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> and Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> charged that House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a Democrat, was holding up the bill at the behest of Democratic state officials. Both <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said reports that former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> may win <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Republican caucuses on March 8 show how easily the caucus system can be manipulated. Said Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, `` If <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wins, you can bet we'll have a presidential primary -LRB- created -RRB- next year.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s caucus turnout is usually no more than 3 percent of the registered voters, but that a primary would easily attract 50 percent. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said more people attend a <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seahawks </ORGANIZATION> game than their precinct caucuses.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, defending his stance on women's issues, says women hold top posts in his campaign and he expects to appoint women to a <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in a Republican presidential debate Sunday night in <LOCATION> Goffstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, rejected criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, but said that if working women are given tax deductions for child care then homemakers deserve tax breaks, too. The former television evangelist called NOW `` a very militant, rather left-wing organization'' and said he would not trust `` one word that they said'' about his positions on women's issues. NOW vice president <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> responded Monday, `` I'd have more cause for concern if he said something complimentary about us.'' She said that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has made clear in his writings, speeches and sermons over the years that, as a NOW summary of the candidates' positions put it, he `` advocates old-fashioned ` family values' and the return of women to the ` traditional' roles.'' `` What that means is he believes women are to be submissive to men in the home, in the workplace, in anyplace,'' said <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>. `` He tries to use Biblical references to support that position.'' The fifth chapter of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s letter to the <LOCATION> Ephesians </LOCATION> says wives must be submissive to their husbands. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has cited the verse in writings and on the religious television show he used to host, `` The 700 Club,'' according to <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>. `` If the top campaign person on his staff is a woman, I congratulate him. Maybe he's making some progress on his point of view,'' said <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was asked by moderator <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> about a NOW political summary that concluded he favored a return of women to their `` traditional'' role. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied: `` I have more women in my campaign right now than any other presidential candidate sitting here or any of the Democrats. The highest paid staff member I have is a woman.'' His campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he was referring to <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON>, his national director of communications. Asked if <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON> earned more than <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign director and chief political strategist, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a campaign press aide, said <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> `` is a consultant He is not actually on our staff, so she is the highest paid person on the staff.'' She said the campaign would not disclose <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON>'s salary or <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>'s compensation. She added that women hold 160 of the 300 paid positions in the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s national office and field staff. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also said his advertising was run by a woman, and that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> runs his national voter identification drive. All of the candidates except <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have men in charge of their campaigns. Harvard law professor <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would appoint women to his Cabinet, and added, `` as a matter of fact, there's one of those Doles would make a fantastic vice president.'' When the moderator pressed him, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` I would say that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Woman with all due deference is a very militant, rather left-wing organization. I do n't know that I would trust one word that they said.'' `` I do not feel that radical feminism is necessary for us today. And what I think we should have in this society, if a woman wants to work, I want absolutely to maek sure that she gets the same pay as a man. But if she wants to stay home, for example, and look after children, I am advocating that if we can give tax deductions for child-care support for working women, we can also give tax deductions to women who want to stay home and look after their children.''

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> calls the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an `` embarrassment'' to the Republican party. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> asks whether Democrats can trust a man who has supported nuclear power and the B-1 bomber. Candidates are on the attack as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary campaign rushes to its climax Tuesday. For several of the dozen candidates bidding for support in the first presidential primary of this election year, Wednesday looms as a day for unpacking and putting their White House dreams in storage. That prospect lends an air of desperation to their tactics and heightens the temptation to lash out at the opposition, especially those leading in the polls. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> professor, said negative ads are appearing earlier than in past presidential contests. While candidates may get some short-term benefit from savaging their opponents, she warned, `` anyone who goes on the attack risks looking non-presidential.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> chipped away at Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once formidable lead in national polls by suggesting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was more bystander than participant in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration councils. That tactic worked well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, looking more like an underdog, has adopted it in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and is portraying <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader who has failed to produce the votes to sustain <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes or to get <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the attacks stay within a limit that enables the attacker to claim he's using comparative, not negative advertising. The most egregious example of an attack that went beyond normal bounds was material distributed by supporters of former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> that suggested a member of Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s family had an abortion. The material, distributed to fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> voters, asked, `` Does he deny that his own family was involved in an abortion?'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON> said the allegation was `` a lie. There's absolutely no truth in it whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> spokeswoman, said there was a possibility a campaign worker in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was involved in distributing the anti-Kemp material. During Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> debate, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> acted outraged when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Give peace a chance,'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` That is a embarrassment,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, `` a Republican talking about give peace a chance.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> elaborated on his wrath. `` ` Give peace a chance' was the rallying cry of the Gephardt-Simon-Jim Wright-wing of the Democratic party that cut off all aid to the freedom fighters in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said `` It was an embarrassment to our party to have our vice president talking like <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also has attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with literature claiming both would raise taxes and cut Social Security benefits. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said the rule is that front-runners do n't attack. She cited an ad run by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a classic front-runner appeal. `` I'm for more trade,'' says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the leader in all polls of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> comes across as taking a positive position that quietly reminds voters that another candidate _ Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> _ has a trade policy his opponents have called protectionist. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> came out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> a winner and quickly was attacked in ads run by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Those ads cited <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> votes in favor of nuclear power and the B-1 and said they were inconsistent with the congressman's current positions. During the Democrats' debate Saturday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> complained to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>: `` When you say in a TV ad, ` Who do you trust?' you're really bringing into play motives, motivation and whether or not somebody is reliable and I think that goes over the line. We can disagree on issues.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called the complaints about attacks `` campaign fatigue, this tit for tat on how bruised I am.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said there was a legitimate distinction. `` I do n't like distinction between positive and negative,'' she said. `` You have fair and unfair. Anything that distorts one's own or an opponent's record is unfair.'' Once <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> became the big winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and erased <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s big lead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> polls, he became the target of attacks. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, on the brink of extinction if he does n't score a breakthrough Tuesday, contends <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would raise taxes. That's about the worst thing a Republican can say about another Republican in this campaign. To prove his point here in notoriously anti-tax <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, du Pont thrust a no-tax pledge at <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> during Sunday's debate and said, `` Sign it.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> refused. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has taken up the tax cry against <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, though he left it to surrogates. At a news conference, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backer, described <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as `` a waitin', walkin', talkin' tax increase about to happen.''

 A coroner's official Monday termed suspicious the death of a newlywed whose husband said she was blown overboard into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> while jogging during their honeymoon cruise. An autopsy was performed Sunday on <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, but the cause of death probably wo n't be released until Tuesday, said Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner's office. `` Right now, it's pending,'' <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON> said. `` However, we can tell you the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.'' The woman's husband of one week, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 36, a chiropractor who moved from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> in June, was held Monday by federal officials in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> following his arrest for investigation of murder. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> was taken into custody Saturday when the cruise ship Star Dancer docked in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. He was held without bail at the Terminal Island federal prison. `` They were very much in love. He really adored her. I ca n't imagine that he would want to hurt her, let alone kill her,'' <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s roommate told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> She asked that her name not be used. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declined to release details of what led to <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s arrest. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> was expected to appear in federal court later this week. The couple were married Feb. 6 before embarking on a honeymoon cruise of the Mexican coast with 731 other passengers. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> told authorities that high winds blew his wife off the deck near the ship's jogging track about 2 a.m. Saturday, but `` the winds were not that strong,'' Star Dancer Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildung </PERSON> said. Also, Chief Purser <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlers </PERSON> said the track closed at 9 p.m. and he never heard the couple running, even though the track is over his room.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its air force attacked Iranian troops along the front Monday, while <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> claimed its warplanes blasted a petrochemical complex and military installations in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also claimed its forces shot down two Iranian drones. Reports by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which have been at war since September 1980, can not be independently verified because they rarely allow access to combat zones. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military communique as saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets flew 60 combat missions along the war front, `` inflicting substantial losses in men, weaponry and equipment, then returned safely to base.'' It said Iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed Iranian military posts in 39 sorties, destroying `` many of the enemy's troop buildups and positions. It gave no details. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported that Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners shot down two Iranian drones at different times Sunday night. One fell inside Iranian territory and another crashed in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, according to the communique. It did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not comment on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims. A communique issued in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said the Iranian air force `` effectively carried out reconnaissance flights over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the Sea of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> Sunday to provide air cover for the navy and reconnoiter positions of foreign vessels in the waterway.'' The Iranian communique, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Iranian warplanes `` heavily bombarded <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> positions and fortifications'' along the southern front east of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> farther south. Iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in one of five raids carried out by early afternoon Monday, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` All the attacking fighters returned safely to bases after inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy,'' the agency quoted a communique as saying. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air force is outnumbered 8-to-1 by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s fleet of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> - and French-made aircraft But in recent weeks, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used its U.S.-made planes in several raids, suggesting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> may have bought spare parts on the black market. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 60-70 operational warplanes, according to Western military analysts. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has previously reported shooting down other Iranian drones. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recently reported successful tests of domestically built drones, but it is not known whether it is producing its own pilotless aircraft yet. It also has reported its war factories are preparing to manufacture fighter planes. The Iranians apparently stepped up efforts to manufacture their own weapons after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proposed an international arms embargo against the Islamic nation to force its rulers to agree to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council cease-fire resolution. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has accepted <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which passed on July 20. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it wants <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> condemned as the aggressor before any settlement can be reached.

 A concrete contractor looked uncomfortable Monday amid cameras, microphones and crowds of people waiting for him to accept an oversize copy of a $ 6,814,823 check for hitting the world's largest slot jackpot. `` I do n't know what to say,'' <PERSON> Cammie </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Cal-Neva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. `` I know I have the money now. It feels pretty good.'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, 61, usually feels at home at the small casino where he became an instant multimillionaire on Sunday by lining up four `` 7s'' on one of four Megabucks progressive slot machines. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>, have been regular visitors at the Cal-Neva since they moved to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> in May 1962, a month after the club opened. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said he comes to the Cal-Neva nearly every Sunday morning to eat the club's 99-cent breakfast and to play the slots. Since 1987, he's been playing the Megabucks machines, more than 200 progressive slots linking 54 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos. `` I figure if I'm going to play, I may as well play for the big dollars,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said of Megabucks, billed as <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos' answer to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state lottery On Sunday he ate his 99-cent breakfast with his 81-year-old father-in-law, then played about $ 20 before he hit the four 7s. After the third reel showed a 7, he pointed a finger at the fourth reel and remembers saying `` Come on, let's hit the other one.'' `` I think I bumped the change girl waving my arms around when that fourth seven fell into place,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> will receive his winnings in annual $ 680,000 payments over the next 10 years. He said he is going back to work on Tuesday, but plans to semi-retire and spend his money on his 11 grandchildren from his three children. `` Our grandkids are going to have a ball,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>'s 59-year-old wife said. `` I just could n't believe it. When they called me yesterday, I just started shaking and crying then called a taxi to get down there.'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> wants to look at some motor homes before investing his money. Hitting the jackpot might have made up for forgetting to buy his wife a Valentine's Day card for the first time in their 25-year marriage. `` This did kind of settle her down,'' he said. `` He can do anything he wants now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> added. Sunday's Megabucks payoff surpassed the record jackpot of $ 4.9 million won by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at <ORGANIZATION> Harrah </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> on Feb. 1, 1987

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> used an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> example Monday in contending all secret services are `` insidious'' and the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> could have fabricated evidence that his client commited war crimes. During closing arguments at <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s trial, lawyer <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> cited a judicial commission report published in October that showed agents of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION> agency routinely perjured themselves in court for 16 years in order to convict Palestinians and conceal violent interrogation methods. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> had more sophisticated ways of fabricating evidence against <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. Defense lawyers claim a key piece of prosecution evidence, an alleged Nazi identity card for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, was forged by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Six prosecution experts have authenticated the card, which says <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was trained as a death camp guard at <LOCATION> Trawniki </LOCATION> in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Secret service agencies everywhere are insidious and resort to fabrication and treachery,'' <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> during a recess. `` I wanted to show that intelligence services can and have in the past fooled courts in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 67, is accused of being a Ukrainian guard called `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible'' who brutalized prisoners and operated gas chambers at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942-43. The defendant, born in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after World War II and was a retired auto worker living in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> extradited him for trial. He says the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> framed him because he fought in an anti-Soviet unit at the end of the war. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said the identity card was suspect because it came from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> archives closed to the West. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the presiding judge, said the card was assumed to be authentic because it was an archival document, and the defense must prove forgery. To that, <PERSON> Sheften </PERSON> replied: `` In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> they use deceit, even in archives. This document does not come from well-organized Western archives.''

<TEXT>
 Hard-drinking crowds poured into the French Quarter on Monday to herald the coming of <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> _ Fat Tuesday _ as the pre-Lenten Carnival season that began Jan. 6 headed for its raucous, often raunchy end. Revelers started wandering into <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s bar between Bourbon and Royal streets at about 10 a.m., said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Polgar </PERSON>, a bookkeeper at the famous watering hole. By midafternoon, the line outside the door of the popular tourist spot stretched for half a block. `` We've got a good crowd,'' said <PERSON> Polgar </PERSON>, who was in an office just off the establishment's open patio bar. `` I can hear them. When I can hear them I know we've got a pretty good crowd.'' Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds made it difficult to walk down Bourbon or Royal. Out-of-town revelers started trickling into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last week and they came in droves during the weekend, undaunted by cold, windy weather or Sunday thunderstorms. On Monday, sometimes dubbed `` Lundi Gras'' or Fat Monday, the thunderstorms gave way to sunshine and mild temperatures. Police spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> said Tuesday's crowds could surpass the estimated 1 million people that jammed the metropolitan area streets last year. `` We do anticipate the crowds to possibly be record crowds as the weather forecast looks great,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. Crowds on Fat Tuesday usually stretch from the stately uptown area, where families gather before sunrise to stake out picnic areas on the parade routes, to the central business district, where business virtually shuts down, and on to the French Quarter, scene of <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>'s raunchiest goings-on. In the Quarter, women on wrought-iron balconies bare their breasts, and gay bars play host to male cross-dressers barely clad in various combinations of women's underwear, hosiery, high heels, feathered headresses and beaded gowns. `` There's a high degree of tolerance by the police on <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> day,'' <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> explained. `` Sometimes the costumes can be outlandish. `` But if there are lewd or obscene gestures made, then the police have to take action.'' Parades this past weekend featured the usual mix of staid, 19th century tradition and 1980s bawdiness. The mostly female Krewe of <LOCATION> Iris </LOCATION> _ formed in 1917 _ featured fairy-tale themes and its masked riders tossed the traditional plastic beads, cups and other trinkets to the thousands who lined city streets. By contrast, the 20-year-old Krewe of Tucks featured a king and queen aboard huge golden toilets. Its maskers threw underwear. As usual, the Krewe of <PERSON> Bacchus </PERSON> made the biggest splash in its Sunday night parade. Along with its huge animated floats and celebrity king, actor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON>, it featured a huge moving aquarium filled with water and a dozen young women in scanty mermaid attire.

 A <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman who has accused top Haitian government officials of involvment in cocaine trafficking said Monday he was going public with details on the charges because of two attempts on his life. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 35, said at a news conference that he personally arranged a cocaine shipment with Haitian army Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the powerful commander of the key batallion in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, the nation's capital. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said he knew of involvement by higher Haitian officials, including those in the ruling government council, but refused to give any names. His attorney, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said he was trying to arrange for <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> to testify before the same <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating alleged drug smuggling by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, who operated a seafood company before becoming involved with drugs, has testified before a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> investigating Haitian drug connections, including <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s role. Sources in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office have told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymnity that a grand jury here is investigating Haitian officials allegedly involved in drug trafficking. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> has identified <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as a target of the investigation. The colonel `` was the one who supplied us with the landing field, the equipment, the whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>. He said he met with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to arrange a 100-kilogram cocaine shipment in December 1986. `` We flew -LRB- the shipment -RRB- out of his own personal ranch in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>. The cocaine was flown from the ranch, 90 miles outside of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> was eventually turned in to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> by the owner of a plane he hired, he said, and then agreed to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. After testifying in a trial here last month, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> told reporters he had once seen 9,000 kilograms, or 19,800 pounds, of cocaine in duffel bags in the palace of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s then-president-for-life, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, before he was deposed in early 1986 <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said Monday he was twice tracked by apparent Haitian hit squads, including one that followed him to the DEA office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. That group was arrested when they were spotted waiting outside the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office, he said, but were released a few days later. Two months later, a second group ran him off a highway. Those men were frightened away by a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer who happened by, said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> was warned by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in January that he would not get into the federal Witness Protection Program if he talked to the media about the case. But since then, no protection has been arranged for him or his family, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` We've given the federal government four weeks in which to do something for Mr. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. `` They have not done so.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, who head's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s major drug traffickers prosecution section, confirmed Monday that <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> `` has been a source of information and is a potential witness'' but refused to say if the investigation involved <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office was not in a position to promise protection for <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> because that program is handled by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's Service. Messages seeking comment from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> DEA office were not answered by midafternoon Monday. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> blamed the lack of action for his client on a division in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on whether to proceed against Haitian officials and possibly destabilize a friendly government. `` It does no good to expose narcotics coming from, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, unless you also shut off the <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> connection,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> testified here last month for the defense in the trial of self-styled Haitian-American freedom fighter <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeb </PERSON>, who was on trial on weapons violations charges in a plot to overthrow the Haitian government.

<HEAD>Elementary School Opens with High Hopes after Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> opened its doors Monday to 335 youngsters from a rainbow of racial and economic backgrounds, following two years of controversy over the makeup of its student body. `` There are no more <ORGANIZATION> Hilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> children and <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> children. They are all South Loop children,'' <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fron </PERSON> declared. The $ 5.5 million inner-city school features special fine arts and science facilities and a staff of teachers that parents helped choose. But there are problems. Some low-income youngsters ca n't attend until third grade, which parents fear will put them at a disadvantage. And there may be problems maintaining the required racial balance among the student body without overcrowding. But <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON>, the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, is optimistic. `` They wo n't allow that school to fail. ... It's being set up to succeed instantly _ in fact, I think it's already succeeded,'' he said. Parents from <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and Printers Row, growing middle-class bastions reclaiming an inner-city wasteland, had fought two years for a new school, saying it had been promised when redevelopment changed the neighborhood. Meanwhile, their children attended classes in a modified townhouse and other schools. But residents of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s low-income <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> Homes project angrily reminded the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> they had been awaiting a new school for more than 20 years. In the end, the board devised a plan that allows children from both areas to attend the school. It calls for a student body of 540 _ 30 percent white and 70 percent minorities. Class size is to remain at an average 30 students. Classes began Monday with about 85 youngsters from <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> <PERSON> Homes </PERSON>, 70 from the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area, 45 from two middle-income high-rises and about 135 others, including 15 Hispanic children, from around the city. The school serves pupils from kindergarten through sixth grade, and eventually will be expanded through the eighth grade. `` As long as integration is maintained and there's no overcrowding, we're satisfied,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoch </PERSON>, leader of Friends of <ORGANIZATION> Dearborn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. But the board's plan gives preference to youngsters from adjoining neighborhoods. That means <ORGANIZATION> Hilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> children will attend nearby <ORGANIZATION> Haines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> until third grade, when they can transfer to South Loop. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> parents say this will put their youngsters at a disadvantage. `` We do n't think we can be sure to get the same education until we go to the same school from kindergarten through eighth grade,'' parent <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' resumption of chemical weapons production sabotaged talks on banning the arms, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> charged Monday. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> the West will not settle for a Soviet advantage in mobile nuclear missiles or conventional or chemical arms. The West wants to see more evidence of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` new thinking'' in foreign policy, said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who arrived Sunday for a brief visit. He is to meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday. `` We in the West will be happier with -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- when we can point to concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an easier neighbor,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said at a luncheon <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> held in his honor on Monday. A text of his remarks was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet foreign minister urged a ban on chemical weapons, saying they are `` the only weapon of mass destruction which is most probably intended for use in the area from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals.'' Last December the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began producing binary chemical weapons, which produce a toxin by combining two relatively harmless agents, following an 18-year moratorium on production of chemical weapons. Talks on a worldwide ban on chemical weapons were close to concluding with an agreement before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to begin producing binary weapons, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` The binary sabotage, and it can not be described in any other way, may push us ... to a new spiral of the chemical arms race,'' said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` Binary weapons, in our judgment, precisely mark the boundary line between the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its European allies. Not an imaginary boundary, but the one inherent in the capabilities of these weapons and their delivery vehicles,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. In his speech, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said Western Europeans are deeply concerned about their security now that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons. `` They see Soviet pressure for a nuclear-free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which in reality means a nuclear-free <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with our Eastern neighbors still in possession of a large mobile nuclear arsenal, in addition to your preponderance in conventional and chemical weapons,'' the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary said. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> dismissed what he called `` any artificial linkage'' between a U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut strategic weapons and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Star Wars'' program. Disputes over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan for a space-based shield against nuclear attack still stand in the way of an agreement to cut both sides' arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles by 50 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will be discussing that issue with Soviet leaders after he arrives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> ruled out any negotiation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over British and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear forces, urged <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> support for sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to end the Iran-Iraq war and welcomed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement last week of a timetable for removing Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed an agreement Monday committing their countries to working together to fight drug abuse and trafficking. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> last met Dec. 7 at <LOCATION> Brize </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stopped off on his way to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an agreement to eliminate their intermediate-range nuclear weapons.

 Last-minute polls released Monday indicated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> were locked in a very close battle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Republican primary. One poll suggested <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had edged ahead, but another said the battle in the nation's first primary Tuesday had tightened. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are struggling for runner-up honors behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The latest <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> tracking poll from Friday through Sunday gave <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> a slim lead, but the day-to-day numbers in the survey suggested the race had tightened since Friday. The interviews with 572 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary voters gave <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 34 percent, to 27 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Given the poll's 5-percentage-point margin of error, that is a small <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> margin The poll put Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 14 percent, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> at 10 percent, and former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> also at 10 percent.

The Sunday night results from the ABC-Post survey suggested a tightening race. Those one-night numbers gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 32 percent each among the 319 voters interviewed. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s analysis said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> surged last week, but that the race closed up Saturday and Sunday. The latest <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll of 588 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in the state gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 32 percent and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 31 percent. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> were tied with 9 precent each. Ten percent of those interviewed Saturday and Sunday were undecided, even after the leaning undecided voters were subtracted. The sampling error margin was 4 percentage points. A poll conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> had results similar to the one-day numbers. This survey, conducted Thursday through Sunday, had <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at 32 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at 31 percent. In less than a week since <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has closed a gap that stood at 32 percent to 23 percent in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favor Far behind were <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> at 9 percent, and du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> tied at 8 percent of the survey of 500 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters. A Gallup Poll conducted Friday and Saturday put <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at 36 percent, his largest margin to date over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was the choice of 28 percent of the 589 likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters surveyed. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> each had 12 percent in the Gallup poll, while du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had 7 percent and 6 percent remained undecided ahead of Tuesday's primary. The Gallup organization reported a 5 percent margin of error among the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters. Among Democrats, all the polls put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> far ahead as always. The ABC-Post survey of 591 likely Democratic voters gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 40 percent. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 17 percent and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 15 percent. Then came Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> with 8 percent; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 6 percent; former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, 6 percent; former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 4 percent; others, 2 percent; and undecided, 2 percent. The margin of error was 5 percentage points.

 Opposition leaders on Monday challenged the lopsided vote totals that gave Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> his eighth straight term as president. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s final, unofficial tally released Monday showed that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> won 88.6 percent of the vote. The party's count also showed a 7.4 percent absentee rate, but opposition leaders contended that up to 40 percent of the 1,446,665 eligible voters boycotted Sunday's balloting. Opposition leaders had urged voters to abstain and accused the ruling party of stuffing ballot boxes, not providing opposition ballots, failing to guarantee voting secrecy and allowing ineligible voters to cast ballots. The 75-year-old <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the longest-serving head of state in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, has led <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since a 1954 military coup. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also won two-thirds of the 72 house seats and 36 senate seats. The remaining one-third will be split proportionally between two participating opposition parties. The <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> received 96,231 votes, or about 7.2 percent, the ruling party said. The Liberal Party got 42,056, or 3.1 percent. The party tally listed 8,838 spoiled votes and 5,627 blank ballots and said 107,220 people did not vote. Voting is obligatory for all citizens between 18 and 60 years old. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguir </PERSON>, a vice president of the unrecognized <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, charged that `` voting booths were lacking in the majority of voting places and the vote was public and not secret, polling officials handed out sealed envelopes with the official candidate list already inside and opposition parties had few or no observed overseers at the polls.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrada </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogues </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, also an unrecognized party, told the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> broadcast station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> that the majority of polling places lacked opposition observers and in some cases no opposition ballots were provided. `` As a result, this is a de facto government,'' he added. `` Yesterday's elections were a joke and the <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> parties allowed themselves to be used in a farce.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> on Sunday described the unrecognized opposition as `` liars.'' Justice Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON> referred to them as `` insurrectionists and subversives.'' <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON>, interior minister and party president, said that the government plans to combat unemployment, eliminate slums and shantytowns and promote domestic and foreign investment. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket led by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> garnered 1,186,693 votes, or 88.6 percent of the total, the party said. In 1983, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> won slightly more than 90 percent. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, said final official vote totals probably would be available Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, whose version of life in exclusive <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hit The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> bestseller list this week, says she feels no bitterness toward her ex-husband five years after their tawdry, well-publicized divorce. `` This is my Valentine's Day present,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> said of reaching No. 10 Sunday on the national non-fiction bestseller list with `` The Prize Pulitzer: The Scandal That Rocked <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> _ The Real Story.'' The book, which on its first page calls <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> a `` Buffet Society Babylon,'' is full of gossip about the rich and famous, from <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON> to Barbra Streisand. There are also descriptions of her cocaine use and sexual fantasies and realities. She says that the first time she slept with publishing heir <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, she fantasized about making love to O.J. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, the former star running back for the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION> football team. Ms. <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, 36, is surprisingly favorable to <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, who has remarried and says he has not read his ex-wife's book. `` I married him because he was the sexiest, smartest, funniest, strongest, most intriguing and interesting man I had ever known,'' she says in the book. They met when her first marriage, to an upstate New Yorker with a home in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, broke up. In an interview, she said she and <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, 56, no longer have any personal conversations. She says she once loved him and does not bear him any bitterness. `` Sadder but wiser, I've learned that the rules are different in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, just as the rich are different. Both are more ruthless. My story is about that difference and my failure to appreciate it, whether out of foolishness, love, passion or all three,'' she says in the book. At the 1982 divorce trial, Pulitzer and other witnesses testified about her cocaine use, affairs, occult experimentation and in general, `` gross moral misconduct,'' in the words of Circuit Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> awarded custody of their twin sons to her husband. Ms. <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, who has visitation rights, got to keep her Porsche, jewelry and some other items, and received $ 2,000 a month alimony for two years. Stunned by the ruling and outraged by the portrayal of her as, she recalls in her book, `` a sex-crazed, cocaine-addicted disciple of witchcraft,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> refused all interviews and book offers. Her money gone, she posed nude in `` Playboy'' in 1985, received more calls from publishers and changed her mind. `` A lot of it had to do with the headlines of 1982, which left a negative taste in everybody's mouth. It just gnawed at me constantly that that was a negative situation I had n't taken care of,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Cassadaga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Kleenex heir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, whose former wife <PERSON> Jacquie </PERSON> plays a prominent role in the book as the third person in an alleged menage a trois with the Pulitzers, says the book is `` garbage.'' `` Do you eat garbage? It's utter garbage, as far I'm concerned,'' <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> `` I have no comment on that,'' <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> said of his ex-wife's literary success when contacted Monday at his estate in <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> `` I have two young boys to bring up. That's a full-time job.'' Before hanging up, he added that he has n't read the book. Other prominent Palm Beachers have said the book is just another in a string of attacks on the high-society enclave that prides itself on exclusivity, including `` Doonesbury'' cartoons by <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> comparing ID requirements to South African laws that enforce apartheid. Ms. <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> said she has written `` an upbeat book that's not revenge-oriented'' for Villard Books with help from <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxa </PERSON>. She also says she wanted to provide a set-the-record-straight account for her sons Mac and <PERSON> Zac </PERSON>, now 10, and to present her arguments for joint custody in divorces, although she admitted few people are buying the book for her opinions on divorce law. She saves her venom for <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Although she lives in an apartment here, across a shipping channel from her old stomping grounds, she still shops and gets her hair done in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, she says. The reactions she receives vary from insults to congratulations for her courage, she says. `` Palm Beachers as a whole have always thought of me as an intruder, that I married into a lifestyle I did n't deserve, that I did n't go to the right boarding schools,'' she said. `` In <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> you have to be Episcopalian; you ca n't be Catholic, you ca n't be Jewish, you ca n't be black. I find that all to be very wrong,'' she said.

 Indian troops screened 30,000 men in a search for Tamil rebels and detained 131, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s chief diplomat in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> said Monday. Ambassador <PERSON> Jyotindra </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> also said nine people believed to be rebels died in the operation. He said some rebels likely evaded Indian forces during the sweep that began Thursday in the <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> district, about 140 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. `` Investigations are continuing and we believe that some Tamil rebels have escaped <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> and moved north and west of the town,'' he said. He said similiar searches were under way in the <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> district in the north and the <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> district in the northeast. Meanwhile, a curfew imposed by Indian troops in and around <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> was lifted for 12 hours Monday. Shops and businesses were crowded as people emerged after a weekend restricted to their homes. Tamil rebels are fighting for a separate nation in the northern and eastern portions of the island. Tamils, who are predominantly <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, say they are face discrimination from the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who are mostly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of Indian troops have been sent to the island to disarm the rebels and enforce a July pact aimed at ending the four-year Tamil separatist war. Tamil rebels have rejected the accord, which was signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The pact grants limited autonomy to Tamil-dominated areas in the north and east. On Friday, Indian troops herded hundreds of men into a football stadium and conducted house-to-house searches in the eastern region. The operation is aimed at finding members of the largest Tamil militia, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> said no Tiger rebel had surrendered or been captured by the Indian troops. <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> would n't elaborate on the detentions, but said up to 31 of the 131 held were `` hard-core'' members of the Tiger group. An Indian helicopter sunk a boat in the <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> lagoon during the operation and about nine people died, he said. `` We believe they were <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>. Our helicopters fired warning shots but the boat did not stop and we had to sink it,'' he said. <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> said that between 45,000 and 48,000 Indian troops were in eastern and northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. He denied media reports that nearly 100,000 troops were deployed. He said less than 2,000 troops were involved in the searches in the east. Sri Lankan officials say nearly 15,000 Indian troops were involved. `` It is in no way a major military offensive as the media both here and in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has made out,'' <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> said. More than 360 Indian soldiers have died since Indian forces began battling the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> in October, according to official figures. Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.

 Hundreds of law enforcement officers from throughout <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and surrounding states formed a procession Monday to pay last respects to an officer killed in a dramatic, nationally televised police chase. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, 51, a 21-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was killed Feb. 9 when he was struck by a vehicle driven by an armed man fleeing from a robbery. He was hit when he got out of the unmarked police car that he had used to try to block the escape. The robber, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, 24, later was shot to death by officers after he took an elderly man hostage. The incident was captured on videotape by the crew of a television news helicopter, who helped foil the escape by landing their craft on the ground in <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>'s path. Funeral services were held Monday morning at the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, then streets were closed to traffic along a five-mile stretch of city streets as the funeral procession moved to Crown Hill Cemetery in Wheat Ridge. About 1,200 of the estimated 1,500 people at the funeral were police officers, said <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> died doing what he did best, serving and protecting,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, police chaplain who officiated at the funeral Mass. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> was a good friend, a fair man in judgment, a person who also made you feel better.'' Following the service, the hour-long procession to the grave site included hundreds of police cars and about 700 police officers, most in uniform. At one point, the procession was four miles long.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give government inspectors the power to close unsafe workplaces and make it easier to file criminal complaints for violations resulting in death or injury. Holding its annual winter meeting here this week, the labor federation's 36-member executive council said the 17-year-old Occupational Health and Safety Act is `` badly out of date'' with other job and community safety laws. `` Reforms are needed to expand protections to workers not currently covered, to expedite standard setting and to require working training and education,'' the council said. Although the details of the requested legislation have yet to be worked out, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s occupational safety and health department, said it will include a provision broadening coverage to several groups of workers now exempted Among them are workers in the nuclear industry, some 3 million transportation workers and more than 14 million employees of state and local governments. The 14.3-million-member labor federation said it also wants to give inspectors for the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> the same authority that a sister agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, has to shut down a plant or other workplace when there is a significant hazard posing an immediate threat to workers. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors can do that in some limited cases now, but they first have to obtain a court order. Some companies also have refused to allow <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors to even enter their plants without such an order. By contesting an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> citation for a violation, companies effectively can postpone abating or correcting an unsafe condition until all appeals are exhausted, Ms. <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> measure also would require safety and health committees with union or other worker representation at each job site. The committees would be given the right to conduct inspections, review an employer's hazard control measures and direct a shutdown of a dangerous job. Business groups also want the law changed, but in a different way. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has called for legislation that would mandate cost-benefit analyses, now being practiced as policy under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration, before <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> can issue new or toughen existing health and safety regulations. The chamber also wants to prohibit <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> from `` interference'' in issues that it says more appropriately belong under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In the past year, unions have succeeded in getting <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to levy fines up to more than $ 2.5 million against companies such as <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest meatpacker, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, during strikes and other labor disputes.

<TEXT>
 The government said Monday an American television journalist and his associates were expelled for `` twisting the facts'' and having an `` openly partial'' stand. `` The government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and its people reiterate their position of open doors to all news media of the world ... within the legal, ethical and moral concepts that govern the area in our country,'' said a statement from the Justice and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. d <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> The correspondent said an agent came to his hotel room Saturday night and told him to pack his bags, and he was put on the first available flight to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He was the second CNN correspondent expelled from the country since last summer. He and the network denied <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s charges. Reporters for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> have been refused entry to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in recent weeks. According to the government statement, `` From the first moment of his arrival in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lamotte </PERSON> worked diligently to misinform the audience of that network about the political developments of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, twisting the facts, placing a morbid sensationalism on his reports and projecting a negative image of the country and its daily events.'' It said the reports were `` openly partial to elements that seek instability and chaos in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement at the network headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> saying: `` The reporting by correspondent <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamotte </PERSON> was fair and accurate. The real problem is that <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> is widely watched in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news service carried by satellite in that country and the government objects to any unfavorable reports. `` Last week <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> carried extensive live testimony by former members of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government who appeared before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating the flow of drugs and money through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lamotte </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>: `` I was objective, fair and balanced. I went down to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with the intention of covering a news story _ not with a chip on my shoulder or anything _ and that's exactly what I accomplished in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But objective, balanced reporting is not what the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> wants.'' In another development, a pro-government newspaper said Monday an official request would be made soon for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> to leave its base in the former Canal Zone. The Southern Command runs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. El Matutino, citing <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources, said the demand awaits only the approval of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Under the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, the canal is to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been exerting pressure on Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, military commander and the power behind <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s government, to step down Public demonstrations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> began last June after the colonel who retired as second in command accused him of illicit activities ranging from corruption and narcotics trafficking to the assassination of political opponents. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> earlier this month for drug-related activities.

 <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, was buried Monday with the honors of a national heroine and a martyr of the leftist Sandinista revolution. Mrs. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, who died of cancer Sunday at age 39, gained fame during the revolution by luring a general into her bedroom, where he was killed by rebels. She gained more publicity in 1984, when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rejected her as ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a eulogy at the the Government House Hall of Heroes and Martyrs, where the body lay in state Monday, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said: `` We have to accept her death, filling the void she left with her example. At the time she fought, victory and triumph were only hopes, but she was there, watching as he companions were killed our wounded, but she always went ahead in combat. `` That was her conduct always, committed to the cause of the poor and the workers and the freedom of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. She was outstanding as an examplary militant on the political front, among the masses and the Sandinista women's organizations, and in action as a commando.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> recalled the `` commando'' action of 1978, at the height of the Sandinista revolution, when she lured Gen. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, into her bedroom and rebels cut his throat. Mrs. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, who was married twice and had four children, later explained the original plan was to kidnap <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> and release him in exchange for 59 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> prisoners. She said the rebels tried to subdue him, but <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> resisted and they had to kill him. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Monday: `` That was <PERSON> Nora </PERSON>, always firm, always advancing, always assuming the post the revolution assigned her during the times of struggle against the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dictatorship and afterwards, when it triumphed.'' She was buried at the General Cemetery in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s old quarter. Mrs. <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> was a lawyer and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> assembly </ORGANIZATION>, a consultative body. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> appointed her ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in February 1986.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pulling out all the stops in his bid to block <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> from a second straight victory, campaigned Monday on the eve of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s primary with conservative hero <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. `` I believe in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He's the man to continue the conservative revolution we started 24 years ago,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the party's 1964 nominee, said in a campaign ad. `` He's the best-qualified candidate for president in my lifetime, other than me, <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' In a furious day of campaigning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has turned the tide that began running against him with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s victory last week in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. `` I'm going to win tomorrow. Believe me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told one campus rally, discounting polls that gave <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> a small lead. In the five-minute commercial with <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the vice president added, `` I sense a rising tide ... With your help, it will carry me to the White House.'' In the election-eve ad taped and broadcast Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is too much a creature of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> carry on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution. `` This election is really a question: Who can you most trust to continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution? Who can you rely on to build on what we have done?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the ad. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slammed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for backing an oil import fee and suggested <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would raise taxes in other ways if elected. `` My closest opponent, Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, says he believes in our revolution ... Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is a popular and respected figure in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But that's where the pressure is most intense to repudiate Reaganism with a tax hike,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, 79, the retired senator, flew six hours from his home in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to be at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s side on the final day of the primary campaign. `` I served with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for many, many years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, who walked with a cane. `` I think he's done a very good job. But running the political affairs of 47 people -LRB- in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is not like running the lives or helping in running the lives of 250 million-odd people.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> shrugged off the <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> endorsement, saying: `` He ca n't vote in this state. <ORGANIZATION> Legendary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> slugger <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the Hall of Fame outfielder, also posed at a news conference with the vice president. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state chairman, said Sunday's night debate turned the tide. He said the polls `` show great movement since the debate. The polls are catching up with reality. We're ahead. We're going to win.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday morning in a television interview that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was making the same mistake <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself made in 1980 when he thought that winning the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses would give him the momentum to carry <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> soundly defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here eight years ago after being upset in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` I want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to do what it did in 1980. ... `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on the CBS Morning News. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is talking momentum and I'm talking issues on taxes and holding the line on the oil import fee and on presidential leadership, and I think it's working, so I want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to correct <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s mistakes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once strong lead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> polls has evaporated and polls now show the race as a virtual dead heat between the vice president and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who finished third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s proposal for a budget freeze `` a cop-out because it avoids the tough decisions.'' Speaking to elderly residents at a nursing home, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s plan a `` straitjacket'' that would limit Social Security cost-of-living increases to two percent. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has said a two percent <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION> cap is one possibility, but he has also suggested exempting Social Security from a freeze. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his own `` leadership freeze'' would achieve a balanced budget by 1993 without touching Social Security or raising taxes. Crowds were sparse on this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday holiday morning as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, informally dressed in a blue ski jacket, made three breakfast stops. He joined two families on a ski trip at a <LOCATION> Bickford </LOCATION>'s Family Restaurant for pancakes and bacon, sipped coffee with the customers at a <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION>' Donuts, and s while chatting with an army sergeant.

 A turbine blade from an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet shattered on takeoff Monday and sparked a brush fire just outside the airport, but the plane returned safely and no one was injured, authorities said. Flight 8 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was taking off from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 11 a.m. when the incident occurred, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, regional spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right after takeoff the pilot had a problem with the No. 2 engine and shut it off,'' said <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. `` Parts of the turbine blade came out and landed on airport property, and some of them landed in a parking lot.'' The jet, a twin-engine European-built widebody A-300 Airbus, can fly safely on one engine, and the pilot returned to the airport 10 minutes later without incident, said <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. The plane carried 249 passengers and 10 crew members. Some passengers said they feared for their lives when the turbine disintegrated. `` It sounded like it hit something,'' one unidentified woman passenger told <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s WPLG-TV. `` There was a loud crash and it just dropped for a few seconds, and then everybody just clutched each other.'' Meanwhile, the hot pieces of the engine had ignited a small fire in a wooded area outside the airport, but no buildings were threatened and no one was injured. The fragments ignited rubbish and tires in the lot, and four fire engines were still fighting the blaze four hours later, said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disptacher <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said the cause of the turbine failure is under investigation, and said there have been only rare problems with A-300 engines previously. `` It could be something sucked into the tube or it could be a turbine failure,'' he said.

 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was upbeat Monday on the eve of the nation's first primary, but he refused to predict flatly that he would notch a second straight win in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> balloting. `` It feels good, like it did in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last Monday,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, his last stop during a day of last-minute campaigning. Flanked by Olympic gymnast <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidmar </PERSON>, former baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> and his chief <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> backer, Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator dodged repeated questions about the outcome Tuesday. `` I do n't know how we're going to do ... That's up to you,'' he said. Speaking to several hundred people in the town hall, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> used the analogy that Monday as primary eve was akin to Christmas Eve. `` It's one hour before the stores close. You might as well take me. I'm the last one who came along today,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> trailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here in the polls by a substantial margin before <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses last Monday. Since then, he has surged in the polls, some of which gave him a small lead. But others suggested his surge had abated, leaving the race too close to call. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said that no matter what the outcome, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a loser in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't have a campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility,'' he said. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bid to salvage <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> already was looking beyond. As for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's claim to have a `` fire wall of support'' in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next month, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said, `` It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.'' Returning to the theme that has dominated his effort, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he stands behind his 27-years of public service and nearly 12,000 congressional votes _ a record <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said does not mean <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has the ability to lead a country. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for blaming <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s deficit ailments. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bashes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> all week and then brings up 35 congressmen to help him out'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, referring the people who came to the state Sunday to help spread <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message. `` I'm not someone who's been on the sidelines, I'm someone who's been in the arena,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, autographed copies of their book `` The Doles _ Unlimited Partners'' while at the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newington </LOCATION>.

 One diehard puffer threw a kicking and hitting tantrum on the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, but otherwise, no-smoking rules took effect Monday with grumbling acceptance by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commuter rail riders. The violent reaction came on the 6:10 a.m. train from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Babylon </LOCATION> when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackney </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> was asked to put out his cigarette, according to <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` He became abusive, and then allegedly kicked the assistant conductor, and the conductor then became involved, and the man kicked the conductor, and then the passenger allegedly struck the assistant conductor in the face,'' <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said. Railroad police took <PERSON> Mackney </PERSON> off at <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, and charged with one count each of harassment and criminal possession of a controlled substance, <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said. The possession charge was filed when <PERSON> Mackney </PERSON> could not provide a prescription or other documentation for seven Valium pills in his possession, the spokesman said. Other protests were verbal. `` I think we're more discriminated against than anyone else around,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who lit up while waiting for a <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> train at the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> station. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Macklowe </PERSON>, who sells computers, pulled strongly on a cigarette as she waited to board her <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> train in <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>. `` I have one, maybe two, before I board,'' she said. `` I light up as soon as I get off.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the railroads, voted last month to outlaw smoking under threat of losing federal mass transit funds. Among those welcoming the ban was <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>, a salesman and onetime pack-a-day smoker from <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>. `` I literally quit smoking because of the putrid smoking cars,'' said <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>. `` We were caged in that smoking car and could n't breathe I had to quit to survive.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> said the law would be enforced in a `` gentlemanly manner,'' and that smokers would be get summonses only if they refuse to put out their cigarettes when asked. There were no plans to put smokers off trains, he said. Violators face fines of up to $ 100. A hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 25 in a suit against the ban filed in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Ten more people have been killed in black facitional violence in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, including an elderly couple who were stabbed to death, police reported Monday. Six of the deaths reported overnight occurred in black townships near <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>. Among them were a 70-year-old man and his wife, 60, and 61-year-old woman, all stabbed. More than 400 people have been killed in the <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> area since early 1987 in a power struggle between two black organizations. Four blacks were killed in <LOCATION> KwaDengezi </LOCATION>, a township near the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, the police reported Monday. They said attackers hurled a firebomb at a house, then fired at occupants who fled. Most of the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> violence stems from a feud between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest anti-apartheid coalition, and <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, the more conservative organization of Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, chief minister of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> black homeland, opposes apartheid but condemns the coalition's advocacy of boycotts and other militant strategies. Front leaders consider <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> too cooperative with white authorities. On Sunday, <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> released the text of a letter to <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON>, co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. In it, he proposed peace talks and blamed both sides for letting the violence continue. `` Men, women and children are being butchered,'' he wrote. `` Apartheid continues to kick us in the guts. And yet we are pathetically shouting at each other from public platforms. It shames me, it shames us both. `` Do you and the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> want a measure of sanity to prevail? You and I know that for this to happen, we will have to reach some sort of accord.''

 On the eve of the first-in-the-nation <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ignored polls showing him far ahead and said the Democratic race is tightening. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he believes the attacks of his chief rivals _ <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> _ may have cut into his support. `` I have n't been watching a lot of television lately, but I'm told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` I assume that's going to take its toll.'' At a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lashed back at some criticism he has been taking from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in recent days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bristled at the charge by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> that he is a technocrat who does n't care about people `` Ask the people who know me best,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` if there is another state in the country that is seriously proposing universal health care. I do n't think you'll find that in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` obviously does not know what he's talking about.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criss-crossed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in a whirlwind final day of campaigning. He said he would not speculate whether he will achieve the 10 percentage point margin that some observers have said is the dividing line between a convincing and a disappointing victory margin for the governor. `` In the closing days of a campaign, things always tighten,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The governor repeatedly exhorted his charges to take nothing for granted Tuesday and to work until the polls close to get out the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vote. Looking ahead to primaries in the southern states _ including Super Tuesday, March 8, when nearly all the Southern states hold primaries _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he will write off no region or state. `` I want to be a candidate who demonstrates that he can do well in all parts of the country,'' he said. In a speech in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, to about 2,000 students from several school districts, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> abandoned a prepared text in which he planned to take direct aim at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>.

It is a policy from which we can not and must not turn aside.'' Instead, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> free-wheeled, giving a brief, standard campaign summary and then taking questions.

<TEXT>
 The government traded one new cordoba Monday for 1,000 old ones and raised paychecks to five times their former level in an attempt to control inflation, which reached at least 1,500 percent last year. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced the currency reform in a broadcast address Sunday, declaring that 10 new cordobas will buy one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. He said the plan was `` the best-kept secret of the people ... so that it would not be discovered by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' Other measures in the leftist Sandinista government's economic package made salaries five times December levels and increased prices of several staples. Gasoline, for example, rose from three new cordobas a gallon to 15. Pay rates had not been adjusted to balance last year's rampant inflation. Because of inflation, the government had been collecting 50-cordoba notes and converting them to 50,000 by stamping on three more zeroes. Until Monday, a dollar cost 70 cordobas in the official market used to import machinery, petroleum and other essential goods, 21,000 cordobas in the parallel market and up to 60,000 in the black market. For the currency changeover, the government opened more than 2,000 booths. Thousands of people lined up, bringing sacks stuffed with the old notes. New currency is offered in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 cordobas. The government retired the old cordoba denominations of 500, 1,000 and 5,000, and the stamped 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 notes. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said a Nicaraguan could exchange up to 10 million old cordobas, equal to 10,000 new ones, and bank deposits would be adjusted automatically. Three days are allowed for the exchange, during which only newspapers, fuel, medicine and medical services can be purchased with the old bills. The government established a temporary radio service to provide information on the currency exchange. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, a helicopter crashed in central Chontales province Sunday because of `` mechanical failure,'' killing five soldiers, a government official and a local representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said the helicopter was carrying new currency. Rides on public transport are free during the exchange period. The national telephone company suspended cordoba payment of international calls until a new rate schedule could be prepared. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has blamed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic problems on the 6-year-old war with U.S.-supported Contra rebels and the American trade embargo. According to government figures, the two factors have cost <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> $ 3.8 billion in lost income. <PERSON> Dinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marenco </PERSON>, the budget and planning secretary, said Monday currency reform `` puts the country in a better position to administer the economic situation.'' On Sunday, vice president <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> of the central bank said the new economic measures would `` benefit production, the fiscal situation and the external trade of the country.'' An opposing view came from <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted `` more inflation in the costs of agricultural production'' and `` unprecedented'' price increases for consumer basics.

<TEXT>
 The government said Monday short-range <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> missiles should not be upgraded now, underscoring differences with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> prepares to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> also said the chancellor will call for an <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> treaty banning chemical weapons, another point of dispute between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In recent weeks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have urged the implementation of a 1983 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision to upgrade the short-range nuclear weapons in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials say short-range missiles gained added importance with the superpower agreement to scrap intermediate-range rockets. The West German government says <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must develop overall arms control strategies first and it insists on reductions in superior Soviet conventional arms before it upgrades the short-range missiles. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> sees no need for an isolated decision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at this point,'' <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said Monday. `` Such decisions should be taken only after new overall -LRB- disarmament -RRB- concepts are worked out.'' The short-range and battlefield nuclear weapons in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have a range of less than 300 miles and thus primarily reach targets on West German and East German territory. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who travels to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, has urged repeatedly that higher priority be given to reducing the overall number of short-range weapons rather than upgrading particular systems. <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> also said: `` During his talks in the American capital, the chancellor will once again press for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said in recent months that it would be difficult to verify such a ban, but West German officials contend problems can be worked out. `` Verification is certainly a difficult question which needs to be solved, but it should not lead us to question the basic feasibility of a chemical weapons agreement,'' <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said Monday.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday defended his country's policies in the occupied territories and blamed Arab countries for `` horrendous'' conditions in Palestinian refugee camps, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, that he does not consider an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference a good idea but is interested in the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative, an Italian official said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Monday for a two-day visit, his first trip outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the start of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrations in the Israeli-occupied territories Dec. 8. His schedule includes talks with Italian political leaders but not with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The prime minister met at a hotel with about 60 leaders of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Jewish community, which numbers about 40,000. The meeting was closed to the media. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Granot </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> described the situation in Palestinian refugee camps in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as `` horrendous'' and blamed `` the Arab countries that have not only refused to solve the problem of refugees but continue to do everything possible to prevent an amelioration of the situation.'' `` We are constantly working for new initiatives for peace,'' <PERSON> Granot </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying. `` We have very clear ideas and proposals that will be presented at the negotiations once they are convened,'' the spokesman quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying. `` We will never give in to the demands of our enemies who are trying to destroy us ... with war and terror.'' <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON> <PERSON> Finzi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION>'s Jewish community, handed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> a letter signed by 500 Jews which expressed concern over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` repressive'' measures in the territories and the `` paralysis'' of the coalition government. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was scheduled to meet Tuesday with Premier <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Goria </PERSON> and leaders of various political parties. During a 30-minute meeting with <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> at Quirinal Palace, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he did not consider an international conference `` the best formula'' for solving the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, said an Italian official at the talks, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. However, the official quoted the Israeli president as saying he found `` useful elements and ideas'' in the latest American initiative. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, the plan calls for an international conference to launch Arab-Israeli talks by April. Negotiations would first focus on a temporary plan to give self-rule to 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. By December, talks on the final status of the territories would begin even if autonomy was not implemented. <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> two months ago. Anti-Israeli protests in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are now in their 10th week.

<HEAD>Talks on Nuclear Testing Resume With Anti-Cheating Measures On
Agenda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators on Monday discussed ways to test anti-cheating measures as they began a second round of talks on limiting nuclear test explosions. Agreement on verification measures would permit ratification of two superpower treaties limiting the yield of test blasts. The talks are due to last six to eight weeks. The chief Soviet delegate, <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON>, said on arrival Saturday that the two sides are expected to agree on the dates and details of joint nuclear test explosions, one in each country, to be held by June. Each side will demonstrate its detection technology in the experiments. <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said the tests will help the two sides agree `` preferably in the first half of 1988'' on verification measures for the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both pacts limit test explosions to 150 kilotons. A kiloton equals the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> never ratified the pacts because of concerns they were unenforceable. <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said he hoped the two sides would agree on a combination of anti-cheating measures that would include both on-site detection, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> favors, and the remote monitoring system <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has not set a deadline for agreement. During the session, preparations for the experiments will continue at the main Soviet test range at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> site in the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert, <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said. The round opened with a meeting at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation is headed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. At the first round in November, the two sides agreed in principle to the joint tests. Both sides agree the negotiations should eventually focus on reducing and ultimately banning nuclear tests.

 The Panchen Lama, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s No. 2 religious leader and generally a supporter of Chinese policy, says <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s `` leftist ideology'' helped spark last fall's violent anti-Chinese riots in the province The 49-year-old high priest, speaking to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s legislature last month, also contradicted Chinese statements that no Tibetans were shot by police in a riot on Oct. 1. Western journalists reported as many as 14 Tibetans and ethnic Chinese were killed. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said most police followed orders not to fire on crowds in central <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the Tibetan capital, but that warning shots ricocheted, injuring or killing people. One person died after being hit directly by a bullet, he said. The demonstrations called for an end to Chinese domination over the remote mountain area. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an integral part of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> territory for seven centuries, gained firm control after its army entered <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1950. The Panchen Lama's Jan. 19 speech was carried by Radio <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and seen Monday in a report by a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring service. He returned to his home in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> this week after a monthlong inspection tour. `` When we arrived in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, we found that comrades of the Han nationality were angry, as were comrades of the Tibetan nationality,'' he said. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> are ethnic Chinese. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> agreed with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials that `` the incidents were mainly caused by ` splittists' inside and outside <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> who colluded with each other.'' But he added that `` over a period of more than 20 years under the guidance of erroneous leftist ideology, we did many wrong things that we should not have done and we should correct these mistakes. We left wounds in the minds of many people and need to cure such wounds.'' <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> was devastated in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, during which Red Guards destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples, persecuted people for their religious beliefs and tried to suppress the customs and language of the remote mountain area. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> was critical of Chinese reports on the disturbances, saying there were many misinterpretations because few <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> journalists spoke Tibetan. Reporters `` wrote their reports in Chinese according to these inaccurate interpretations, and the editors or editors-in-chief revised the reports according to the requirements of such reports,'' he said. The official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> media, in a campaign to emphasize the government position on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, has carried hundreds of reports about Tibetans who condemn the rioters, monks who regret their actions in the riots and social and economic progress in the area. The reports have increased this week with the approach of a two-week religious festival that attracts thousands of Tibetan pilgrims to <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The Panchen Lama confirmed that officials considered canceling the festival because of concerns of possible violence. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> is a loyal supporter of Chinese policy, in contrast to the man considered <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s religious leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1959 and lives in exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The Chinese government says his anti-Chinese statements and calls for Tibetan independence were the main cause of the riots, which were led by monks. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> spent nine years under house arrest for refusing to denounce the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, and was not permitted to visit <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> again until 1982.

 No one knows how large the underground economy is, but it functions in countries throughout the world at considerable direct and indirect costs, according to a new study. `` Under the table and off the books, millions of persons worldwide are engaged in jobs that evade the relevant tax and labor laws _ frequently with an official scowl, but a tacit wink, from their governments,'' says the report released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Titled `` The Informal Economy: Studies in Advanced and Less Developed Countries,'' it includes essays by 19 authors from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One author estimates the size of the underground economy at 4.4 percent, another 10 percent, another 33 percent of total production. The size also varies by place and industry. `` Negative consequences of the -LRB- underground -RRB- process are endured not only by workers _ who must cope with low wages, insecure jobs and lack of occupational safeguards _ but also by entire industries,'' they say. Bolivian cocaine processors, Soviet vodka distillers and thousands of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> unregistered cabdrivers are all considered part of a growing underground world economy that the says skews statistics as well as producing huge unreported and untaxed profits. Whatever the amount, the underground activity rarely if ever shows up on the official statistics used by nations and world organizations in making crucial economic policy decisions. A decade ago the size of the underground economy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> alone was estimated at more than $ 16 billion. <PERSON> Saskia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassen-Koob </PERSON>, director of the urban planning program at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architecture </ORGANIZATION> and Planning, says a survey in 1981 of four blocks in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> found 90 percent of all interior construction being done without permits. She estimates that there are 21,000 `` gypsy'' taxicabs not licensed by the city, twice the number of legal cabs. A study based on a survey of 1,000 recent Soviet immigrants to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> estimates that in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities of the late 1970s, 40 percent of the households received more than a quarter of their income from `` informal'' activities. These ranged from distilling vodka to market gardening, and from bootleg medical services to repairing private cars with parts stolen from government garages, according to former residents. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about 40 percent of the workforce is believed to be `` informally'' employed, the editors say.

 A dentist facing charges stemming from the discovery of a man's mummified body eight years after his death asked a circuit court judge Monday to withdraw a guilty plea, his lawyer said. `` When he pleaded guilty, he did n't have a lawyer and was n't familiar with court procedings,'' attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepmeyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> had pleaded guilty Feb. 1 on a misdemeanor charge of failing to report a death. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, 56, a former <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> dentist, was charged in the case of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, whose body was found last month at his Knoxville-area home. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, 42, also pleaded guilty to charges of failing to report the death. The charge carries a maximum of one year in prison and $ 1,000 fine. The pair were awaiting sentencing. Both also are charged with forging <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' name on legal and bank documents. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> also is charged with cruelty to the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' teen-age son and daughter who also lived in the house with the corpse, authorities said <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who had been in custody since Jan. 29, was released from <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday after posting 10 percent of his $ 55,000 bond.

 Police agreed Monday to beef up security at a sprawling shopping mall after fights broke out among some teen-agers. `` I ca n't give you any numbers, but we are going to have some more officers out there this weekend,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Marxen </PERSON> said Monday after meeting with officials of <LOCATION> Southpark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>. `` We are confident there wo n't be any more problems out there,'' he said. But police said early accounts of the incident were exaggerated; though an estimated 100 teens were on hand, they were not all involved, police said. `` All 100 kids were not fighting. A scuffle broke out here and there among the group,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanger </PERSON> said. `` They found one barbecue fork and one piece of wood _ very few weapons,'' he said. Three 15-year-olds from nearby <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> were arrested on disorderly conduct charges Saturday after teen-agers started fighting near a drug store at the mall, police said. Those arrested were released later that day. `` People were scared in here,'' said one merchant, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON>. `` I had people crowding around this booth and asking me if they could get inside because they were scared.'' Disturbances have been escalating for weeks at the 135-store mall, merchants said, with some saying it involved high school rivalries and others saying it was a deliberate diversion to provide cover for shoplifters. `` Two or three people were fighting and some other gang members came down and got involved in it,'' mall employee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreiter </PERSON> said. `` It's been building every weekend and every time a few more people get mad. It just built up until ... everything let loose.'' Mall officials hired police officers to work Saturday because they were expecting problems after minor fights had broken out the weekend before, <PERSON> Marxen </PERSON> said. `` We were n't expecting such a large number of kids,'' Police Sgt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmelzer </PERSON> said. `` We had two officers in the area but they were n't able to contain the crowd, not only the people who were fighting but the people who gathered.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> rejected the `` slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations'' of those who want him to resign, and urged the nation Monday to unite behind him. His televised speech appeared certain to deepen divisions caused by the report of an international panel of historians last week. It questioned the president's moral integrity and said he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing to stop them. On Monday, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> claimed without giving specifics that `` parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are built on presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions drawn can not be upheld.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, used highly emotional language in appeals both to World War II compatriots and those too young to know `` the horrors of this war.'' He said he might have erred in not discussing his wartime past but said he never tried to conceal it. `` I have a clear conscience,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general told <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s 7.5 million citizens. In their 202-page report, the historians concluded that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> tried to cover up his service as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. The government appointed the panel at <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s request in September, after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put him on a `` watch list'' of undesirable aliens. In an interview broadcast Monday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s World News Tonight, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> appealed to the American public for understanding. `` If I have misled my friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because I did n't say anything as far as my military career is concerned, I am sorry. ... It was not done purposely. Believe me. And I hope this will be understood because I have so many friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And I hope they will believe me that I have n't done anything wrong.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> also said that resigning would be against the wishes of those who elected him. `` Do you really think that a clear decision by the Austrian people on the presidency _ who should be president _ should be corrected? Accusations which are completely wrong, which have no foundation. Why should then the president resign, leaving the country in disaster?,'' he said. Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said in a televised interview Sunday, which was praised even by conservative critics, that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` did not deal exactly with the truth'' and must restore his credibility. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said he would consider resigning if the conflict over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> continued occupying time the government should devote to other matters. The Socialist chancellor leads a coalition with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which supported <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> for election in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said after the 14-minute speech Monday it was `` a great disappointment'' and means <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` will continue to be an unbelievable burden for our country.'' A petition drive for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation has obtained more than 2,000 signatures, including those of most leading intellectuals, according to an employee of the news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Profil </ORGANIZATION>. It printed the first 1,496 signatures on three pages Monday. About 5,000 opponents of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> demonstrated in downtown <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Sunday, and about half marched to his office in the <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> palace </LOCATION>, calling for his resignation. The president has consistently denied wrongdoing since Austrian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media first disclosed his <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> service in March 1986, during the presidential election campaign. As the controversy continued, he has refused all demands that he resign. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> reiterated his stand on Monday, arguing that resignation would undo a decision fundamental to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s democracy `` In the course of the renewed discussion, the question was also put about my premature departure from the office of federal president,'' he said. `` I want to take a stand in all clarity: You, my dear Austrians, have elected me federal president with a convincing majority in a secret and direct election for six years. `` Thus it is no longer a matter of the man <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>,'' he said. `` In view of the slanders, I have often asked myself in the last two years whether I should carry on. `` It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an election result can not be subsequently corrected,'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said. `` A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations.'' In a runoff election in June 1986, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> won with 53.6 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON>, the Swiss chairman of the historians' commission, said in a magazine interview published Monday he thinks <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> would do <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> a service by resigning <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, deputy chancellor of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and head of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated his support for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> but Economics Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, another leading conservative, expressed impatience. <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` must take a decision which is very important for our country.'' In a radio interview several hours before the president spoke, <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> said he was concerned about <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s tainted image and praised the comments <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> made Sunday. Conservative commentators who once stood solidly behind the president also were complimentary about the chancellor. In an apparent reference to <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> asked political leaders Monday `` not to pour oil on the fire'' of debate. He said the debate abroad would abate if `` the polemics stop inside <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> itself.'' To `` my dear countrymen'' he said: `` You can trust me as you trusted me two years ago when you elected me. ... Those people who spread intolerance and discord can not be allowed to prevail, but rather the great majority of those for whom it is a question of our homeland, of our common <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` If we want this, we will do it together and can form the future with new strength.''

 A court sentenced seven men to labor camps Monday for running a crime ring that used African diplomats to smuggle paintings, icons and jewelry out of the country, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The official news agency said the sentences ranged from four to eight years. `` During the arrest and search more than 200 paintings of the 15th-20th centuries, 800 icons framed in pearls, jewelry -LRB- including works of Faberge -RRB- and 2.5 million rubles -LRB- about $ 4 million -RRB- worth of diamonds were confiscated,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the total value of the stolen goods was 4.2 million rubles, or about $ 6.7 million at the official exchange rate. The agency did not say when the men were convicted, but sentencing often occurs at the time a verdict is read. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Fand </PERSON>, a painter and former policeman, led the ring. He and his gang had contacts among Soviet emigres who operated antique shops in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The news agency said the group was aided by a number of diplomats from about 10 African countries who acted as couriers. `` Some of them were accredited and others are still accredited in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Using their diplomatic privileges, they carried valuables across the border and smuggled to the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> money and sometimes consignments of watches and other goods,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Among those sentenced was <PERSON> Fassinou </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Totin </PERSON>, a citizen of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> who had been a graduate student at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> university. <PERSON> Fand </PERSON> was sentenced eight years in a labor camp and <PERSON> Totin </PERSON> to five. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andronnikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yegeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> received six-year terms, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Khavilov </PERSON> was sentenced to a five and <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON> got four.

 Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who made a crusade out of wooing business to the state, is now threatening to sue <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for breaking what <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> says was a promise to keep an auto plant open. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> promised it would build Omni-Horizon cars for five years at a <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant it took over when it bought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and that a suit will be filed if the state ca n't get a satisfactory settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials have denied the plant closing would break a legal commitment. `` We did not lie to anybody,'' company chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> told reporters when asked about the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> decision last week. Late last month <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced it would halt production at the 86-year-old plant. The move will result in the layoff of about 5,500 workers by late summer. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> maintained the company made the five-year pledge in exchange for a state promise of money to help retrain workers. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s business image, as well as the image of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, could be affected if the case goes to court, some legislators and business leaders say. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaulay </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> would have an `` iffy'' lawsuit, but good arguments by the state could lead to an out-of-court settlement. `` The audience the state is trying for now is <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> lawyers,'' said <PERSON> Macaulay </PERSON>, who has taught contract law for 30 years. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is preparing to go to trial with a similar lawsuit filed last fall after an <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hocking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> glass factory closed in <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION> and put 940 people out of work. He insists the lawsuit can be won, even though there is no signed contract calling for autos to be produced in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for five years. `` There is no reason for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> not to live up to its agreement,'' he said. But `` we are going to explore every possibility to settling this as quickly as possible,'' he added. Members of the business community, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the legal profession express doubts about the wisdom of filing a suit. `` We're working very hard to project <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> as a business-friendly state,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, a 3,000-member association. <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> said a state's reputation in the business community can be `` set back real fast if you are n't careful.'' `` This will undo all the governor has sought to do to improve the business climate'' in his first 13 months in office, said Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Feingold </PERSON>. `` We're going to get a black eye in the business community across the nation,'' said <PERSON> Feingold </PERSON>, a frequent foe of the Republican governor. But <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said failure to enforce the verbal agreement would send the wrong message. `` They broke their word. There is no other way to describe it,'' he said. State Attorney General <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> has advised <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> that despite the lack of a written contract, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has a `` clearly enforceable'' agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said company officials were sorry the plant had to be closed. `` I guess you could say <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was overly optimistic'' when it told workers and government officials it believed it could build the <LOCATION> Omni-Horizon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for up to five years, he said. <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> said the state could sue for breach of contract and demand <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> keep the factory open or pay damages for unemployment benefits and other social costs of the mass layoff. Damages could approach $ 100 million, he said.

 Police fought Palestinians in the holy city Monday and hospital officials said an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was wounded by gunfire. It was the first bloodshed reported in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since riots in the occupied lands began Dec. 8 In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, military investigators questioned four young <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> who say <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers using a bulldozer buried them alive after a protest Feb. 5. `` I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON>, 19, said soon after he was questioned in a white police van. `` I dream about it all the time.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, military commander in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said a sergeant-major from the military government and two or three other soldiers were involved and would be tried. He told army radio: `` Even in my worst dreams, I would never imagine such a thing even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most awful things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens.'' In another case, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> said three soldiers of the elite Golani brigade were given jail terms of at least 21 days each for violating orders against excessive use of force. The army said it had no information on the matter. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 54 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since protests began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Most of the dead were shot by soldiers, and hundreds have been wounded. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media, meanwhile, said leaflets have surfaced in the occupied territories calling on residents to stage a `` day of wrath'' Tuesday by stepping up protests, attacking Jewish settlements, holding commercial strikes and staying home from their jobs. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, members of the Gush Emunim settlement movement said they were printing flyers to be distributed in Arab areas. The leaflets contain threats that if the protests continue, Arabs might be ousted from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 21 arrests were made Monday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has annexed, bringing to 437 the number of Arabs detained in the city since trouble began in December. It said the latest arrests include four activists who been leaders in organizing protests. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said arrests were made in the <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION> refugee camp and <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> village, both inside the city limits. He said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse stone-throwing protesters in <LOCATION> Anata </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said there were no reports of shooting, but a border police officer at the scene told photographers rubber bullets and live ammunition were used. Officials at <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> hospital said a 23-year-old Arab from <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION> was brought in with a gunshot wound in the abdomen. The Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said he was shot during a clash in <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION>.

Increasing signs of friction appeared between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over new <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposals for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations based trading territory for peace. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> he disagreed with a statement by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, made in a speech last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that negotiations must involve such a trade. `` That's not the principle that guides me,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, whose right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes the return of land <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Later in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> defended his country's policies in the occupied territories and blamed Arab countries for `` horrendous'' conditions in Palestinian refugee camps, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> the call for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference was not `` the best formula'' but said he is interested in the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative, an Italian official said.

 A ferry being readied to carry Palestinian deportees on a PLO-sponsored protest voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was damaged by an explosion Monday that was believed set off by a limpet mine. A man claiming to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said the U.S.-based extremist group was responsible for blasting the 6,151-ton Sol Phryne at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, its home port on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' southern coast. A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official interviewed in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said: `` It was an underwater blast caused by a mine that was stuck, probably by frogmen, onto the vessel. It was attached to a time fuse.'' Asked what the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> planned to do now, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` We are waiting for a decision by the command. We have to see if there is an alternative ship for the voyage.'' `` The JDL is responsible for the bombing at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>,'' said an anonymous caller. `` This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it.'' He telephoned his statement to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. He said `` no comment'' when asked if the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> also was behind the Sunday car-bombing that killed three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. The three _ <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Marwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kayyali </LOCATION> _ were involved in negotiations to charter the vessel for the voyage, <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> security sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> advocates use of violence in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. It was founded in the early 1960s by New York-born <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, now a member of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and head of extremist, anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. There was no way to verify the caller's identity. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>: `` Whoever did this righteous action, we do n't know him or her personally ... It's a great honor they gave us the credit, but it belongs to people much more courageous than the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.'' A group that belonged to the original <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement issued Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` The JDO claims no direct involvement in this righteous attack, but supports it 100 percent.'' In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman who has been overseeing preparations for the much-delayed voyage, insisted the `` Ship of Return'' will sail. `` We are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite of Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, noble ideas,'' he said. <PERSON> Fouad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Bittar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> diplomatic representative in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, said `` the damage -LRB- to the 40-year-old ferryboat -RRB- is not very severe.'' He said a hole 21 -LCB- inches wide was ripped in the hull. In <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, a senior aide to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the organization will get another craft for the voyage. <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, also said `` Zionist terrorism'' disabled the Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had tried to launch the voyage from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, but it was repeatedly delayed, reportedly under Israeli pressure. The 130 deportees plus hundreds of international supporters and journalists were taken in buses to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport Monday and were told they would be flown to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to board the boat. After news of the blast reached <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, most returned to their hotels. Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>'s captain, <PERSON> Cleanthis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlahopoulos </PERSON>, said his vessel `` would not be fit to sail for several months.'' The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The trip is designed to focus condemnation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of deporting Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. The deportees included taxi drivers, laborers, a university professo, an Anglican bishop, several mayors and city council members. The voyage was supposed to end in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters. <ORGANIZATION> Limassol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghighis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` There will be ... an underwater survey to find out exactly what happened, how big a hole there is and what repairs may be necessary.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted political sources in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> itself set off the explosion because it realized it could not succeed in its mission to reach <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> shores.

 A new superconductor that operates at higher temperatures and may be easier to adapt to practical applications has been discovered by a research team in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, scientists said Monday. The superconductor is not merely a refinement of either of the two known high-temperature superconductors, but an entirely new compound that in some respects may exceed the performance of the others, said a panel of scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The new material _ a mixture of bismuth, strontium, calcium, copper and oxygen _ raises the temperature at which superconductivity occurs to about 243 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, a jump of more than 50 degrees above levels attained with previous superconductors.

 This is where they teach elephants to do tricks. In six months to a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kambas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elephant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> can teach an elephant to salute, sit on concrete bench, lift things, pull cars, climb steps, kick a ball, step over a prostrated person _ and play soccer. This year 25 of the school's best soccer players were selected from a group of 42 to play Feb. 8 at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampung </PERSON> as a highlight at a national Koran-reading contest. The Koran is the Moslems' holy book. The players received three months' intensive training on how to play good, clean soccer, because even in elephant soccer, which has become popular in some areas of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, a player can be penalized. After graduating from the school, the elephants are auctioned off, with a knockdown price of $ 5,992, to perform in circuses or other events. Most of the elephants enrolled in the school come from the thick tropical jungles here on the island of <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION>. They are rounded up with the help of experienced trainers from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> called `` Mahout.'' The Mahouts have brought several `` seasoned'' elephants from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> called `` kunce'' to help lure prospective students to a secluded spot, where they are narcotized with dart-guns. Then the sedated elephants are loaded onto trucks and brought to the school at <LOCATION> Lampung </LOCATION>. The idea of teaching wild elephants to do tricks arose after the government decided against trying to decrease <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION>'s elephant population to keep them from damaging farm crops. Thus, with the help of the government of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the school was established in the <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kambas </LOCATION> district of south <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> in August 1985. The school covers an area of 1,235 acres and has a staff of 10, including five Thai Mahouts. An increasing human population on <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> and uncontrolled slash-and-burn farming methods have resulted in a scarcity of food for wild elephants, leaving them to forage on farms. The province of <LOCATION> Lampung </LOCATION> alone has about 500 wild elephants, whose number grows at a rate of about 20 a year. The <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> government has launched several campaigns to move the elephants to conservation areas. The biggest conservation campaign, started in 1982, has succeeded in moving 230 wild elephants into a conservation area in central <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Chatru </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has given up praying to the `` rain gods.'' He is tired of waiting for the misery of drought to end. He's thinking about leaving his farm and moving to a city like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. His fields lie barren, his cows and buffaloes are emaciated for lack of fodder, and he has barely enough food for his family. Four consecutive years of drought here in the state of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> have reduced his farm and hundreds of thousands of others to expanses of dust. The drought has brought severe shortages of drinking water and fodder, spiraling prices and fears of even worse times ahead if the rains fail again this year. The lack of water and feed even has afflicted the state's hundreds of thousands of camels, the main mode of transportation for villagers scattered about the desert area Instead of growing lentils and wheat on his five-acre farm, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 46, now builds roads under a government relief program. He considers that demeaning work, but it provides him with 70 cents a day to feed his wife and three children. `` First the monsoons failed so our summer crop was destroyed, and then we could n't sow the winter crop because there was no moisture in the earth,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said during a pause in his work on the road. Even so, he said, he sowed some seeds, but the birds ate them. The <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state government is engaged in a massive relief program, selling wheat at subsidized prices, hiring people for construction work, running camps for abandoned cattle and deepening wells. But officials say that if it does n't rain this summer, the state can not continue the program. <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>, which forms a part of the vast Thar desert extending from western <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, traditionally is drought-prone. The normal rainfall in the state, known for its forts and palaces, varies between 2 inches to 10 inches but last year the rains failed completely. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was gripped by the century's worst drought last year and 16 of its 25 states were affected. Those states asked the federal government in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> for $ 4.6 billion in assistance but got only $ 1.54 billion to divide up among them. `` We will have a law and order problem this summer if it still does n't rain,'' said R.N. <PERSON> Meena </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Ajmer </LOCATION> district's top administrator. `` Many animals will die. No one can save them. Only the rains can.'' The district has an estimated 650,000 cattle and they need fodder, <PERSON> Meena </PERSON> said. `` We bring in about 80 to 90 trucks from other states while the requirement is 400 trucks.'' Water in <LOCATION> Ajmer </LOCATION>, a city of 450,000 people, comes once every three days, and people store it in every available receptacle. Housewives save bathwater to use for their laundry. <PERSON> Anasagar </PERSON>, a huge artifical lake that provided drinking water to <LOCATION> Ajmer </LOCATION>, is completely dry for the first time since it was created in the 12th century by the damming of the <LOCATION> Luni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Residents say it is a curious sight to see people walk on the lake bed. `` There is hardly any ground water here because the area is rocky,'' said <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Prashad </PERSON> <PERSON> Choudhary </PERSON>, spokesman for the district. He added that only very big farmers can afford the high cost of digging irrigation wells. It costs about $ 7,692 to dig a well because the drilling has to go down 700 feet to reach ground water, <PERSON> Choudhary </PERSON> said. Many poor people, whose main occupation was raising cows and selling milk, have abandoned the animals or sold them to butchers from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> at throwaway prices. A count in 1983 came up with 49 million head of cattle in all of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s second-largest state with 39 million people. Nobody knows how many are left. In normal conditions, each animal requires about 45 pounds of food a day. The people of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> often face the dilemma of feeding themselves or their cattle. <PERSON> Zakeera </PERSON> <PERSON> Banu </PERSON>, a Moslem woman working on a state project to deepen a pond near <LOCATION> Ajmer </LOCATION>, said, `` I earn 9 rupees -LRB- 70 cents -RRB- a day. I can either buy enough fodder for my two goats or vegetables for ourselves.''

 The government estimates that 10,000 to 20,000 homeless children roam the streets of the Ermita red-light district in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, falling into lives of prostitution, petty crime and drug addiction. Volunteers and social workers have mobilized in an effort to save them. `` We have street children, we have all types of exploited children. They are victims,'' said <PERSON> Nenuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a volunteer with the government's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the children drifted into <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> from impoverished rural provinces. But with few skills and no education, both parents and children survive by begging and by selling cigarettes and smuggled watches. Many of the children go on to prostitution, pickpocketing, shoplifting, extortion and drug trafficking. But the government and private agencies are now intensifying efforts to find and rehabilitate such children and break the cycle of crime and poverty. `` We go to them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` We talk to them. We sit on the sidewalks with them, invite them to a hotdog sandwich or something.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the children are easiest to persuade on rainy days when `` business is bad'' or when they are apprehended by police. Once they have been found, children 6 to 13 years old are taken to the welfare department's `` tent schools'' where they receive counseling and the rudiments of reading and writing. Those who have suffered serious beatings, drug addiction or sexual abuse are taken to a half-way house in <LOCATION> Alabang </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb where they receive psychiatric help. Teen-agers go to state-run juvenile institutions. Officials say child prostitution has been a problem for years and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has promised to crack down on child prostitution and give greater priority to child welfare programs. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s welfare department director, said the city's two tent schools have successfully reintegrated some 100 children since the program began last year. The department plans to build a third school in <LOCATION> Ermita </LOCATION>, the red-light district of seedy bars, brothels and cheap hotels near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said about 800 children have been graduated over the past two years from the Alabang center. But she added that about 800 others escaped and returned to the streets. `` That's because they are not helped,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> said. `` It's not because they really want to but there is no other way for them to survive Unless a helping hand comes along and helps them recover, that is what will happen to them.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said criminal syndicates work actively against welfare workers to prevent children from seeking help. `` I've seen some of these transactions, but we can not intervene,'' she said. `` There is a Mafia. They are surrounded by pimps. They have become hardened. We can not reform their personalities.'' In the best of circumstances, she added, saving a child who may never have had a home can be a long, painful process. `` A -LRB- street -RRB- child does not open up to you until maybe six months,'' she said. `` You have to gain their trust first. You do n't force them to open up because they will all answer lies They've learned this from the streets But if you leave them at their own pace, little by little they will tell you their stories. They know they have a friend.'' For 18-year-old <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, a former drug addict, the breakthrough came when he asked social workers to give him a birthday party. Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said that during the party, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> began to cry and admitted it was not his birthday. `` I told him never mind, that's for all the birthdays you never had,'' she said. `` He was touched. From then on he said, ` I want to go to school, I will stop my drugs,' and he did stop.'' The youth is now in the fourth grade and serves as `` older brother'' to newcomers at the Alabang center. `` We are building up for the future,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A disparaging word about <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government seldom is heard in the homes on the range of rugged <LOCATION> Patagonian </LOCATION> More than 1,300 miles removed from the political machinations of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, inhabitants say they prefer progress to protest. And many are quick to credit President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the right-wing army general, with bringing the 20th century to the isolated southern region, where even the relatively young recall when hitching posts lined the streets. `` He is a great man,'' proclaimed <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chible </PERSON>, standing in the sunlit living room of her roadside home and restaurant about 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Coyhaique </LOCATION>, the region's capital. On the wall hangs a color photograph of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, broadly smiling from behind his presidential desk. It is hand-signed, `` Affectionately yours.'' Support for the army commander who seized power in a 1973 coup is considered stronger in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s rural provinces than in the big cities, where the political opposition is most active. But nowhere is it stronger than in Chilean <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION>. The reason lies outside Mrs. <PERSON> Chible </PERSON>'s door: an unpaved but well-tended road that the government calls the Great Southern Highway. The two-lane road winds along the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> for some 350 miles, through mountains, forests and sheep ranches. Still under construction, it was started by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s administration. He considers it one of his most important public works and each year proudly comes to officially open a new stretch. `` People cried with joy when the road came through,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chible </PERSON>, who is about 50, told a visitor. `` Before, life was terrible. Now the wool gets out, and life is rich.'' <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Avedano </PERSON>, a horsecart operator, agreed, calling the road `` one of the great works'' of the president. `` You've go to give him that.'' Cut off from the rest of the country by deep fiords, towering mountains and glaciers, <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION> remained virtually uninhabited for a long time after <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> achieved independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1810. It was notorious for blustery weather year-round, with winter temperatures dipping to 20 below zero. Settlers began trickling in when, in the early 1900s, the government handed out tracts of land to sheep ranchers. Coyhaique was founded just 50 years ago, and until recently was little more than a place where ranch hands came to get drunk on pay day. `` The people were fairly rough-edged,'' recalls <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, an art historian who was born in <LOCATION> Coyhaique </LOCATION> in 1951. He recalls, as a child, seeing a cowboy ride his horse down the narrow hallway of the local hotel, firing a six-shooter into the ceiling. `` The guests, who were sleeping just above, were terrified,'' <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> said. `` It was quite a scandal.'' Then came the highway, and with it new settlers, supermarkets, department stores. Jeeps, pick-up trucks and even taxis have replaced horsecarts on the downtown streets. At the airport, where an aging cargo plane used to land just once a week, modern passenger jetliners arrive daily with businessmen and tourists. `` We went from the hitching post to video clubs, practically overnight,'' <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> said. Employed by the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>'s division of culture, <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> is anxious to preserve some of the settlers' traditions, such as working with leather and wool `` It's rapidly becoming contaminated by the contact with outside, with <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>.'' Many of the traditions came from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, through the mountain passes that once were the only way in and out of Chilean <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION>. Political relations between the neighboring countries often have been tense, and a territorial dispute brought them to the brink of war in 1978. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s efforts to develop and populate the region are seen, at least in part, as an effort to protect it from invasion. Recent waves of nationalism have diluted the area's Argentine flavor. Chilean cowboy songs and dances replaced those of the Argentine gaucho, and the Argentine habit of drinking tea from a hollow gourd became less popular. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, an anthropologist who works with <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, said that in outlying villages and farms many of the old customs are preserved. `` People spin their own wool, weave their own ponchos and make their own riding tack from leather they themselves have tanned,'' he said. But many have left <LOCATION> Patagonia </LOCATION> to sign on for ranch work in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Some come back when their three-year contracts are up. Others, having developed a taste for American living, do n't.

 The South Korean press is enjoying a broad degree of freedom after years of tough official control, but opposition quarters maintain it still is manipulated by the government's `` hidden hands.'' Nevertheless, the nation's newspapers are reporting and commenting more vigorously on politics and other subjects that for years had been limited or banned by the government. President-elect <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who takes office Feb. 25, promises to ensure full press freedom and made it a key point in his election campaign. The government began easing press restrictions last summer under pressure from <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. `` We have done much and there should be nothing to complain about,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-bai </PERSON>, the assistant culture-information minister. Journalists agree the government has abandoned most controls on the domestic press, such as regular visits to newspapers by security agents and the issuance of `` press guidelines'' that dictated what could be reported and in what way. Government reguirements on registration of journalists have been dropped and new legislation will end limits on newspapers having news bureaus outside their headquarters locations. There also will be no limits on the number of pages a newspaper can publish. `` The ball is in the court of the news media. It's up to them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Min-sup </PERSON>, a ranking member of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition politicians and dissidents contend, however, that much of the press still remains under government control through `` hidden hands.'' Rep. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-ryong </PERSON>, spokesman for the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` No basic changes have been made and the press still is no more than a public relations tool of the government.'' The opposition claims the government exerts behind-the-scenes influence and control, ranging from intimidation to patronage and bribery. They also contend the media is packed with government supporters. Rep. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-sun </PERSON>, spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, claimed journalists are practicing self-censorship. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-hong </PERSON>, secretary-general of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Essentially, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is the same as his dictatorial predecessor. He would not give in easily. We must continue to fight for press freedom.'' Several editors and reporters rejected the opposition charges of self-censorship, but said they want to help ensure `` sound political development'' without endangering social stability. One senior editor, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said many journalists are cautious because `` they suspect the true intention of the government.'' The opposition claims the country's two networks, which are state-owned, project only a government viewpoint and that opposing points of view receive little attention or are distorted. A Korea Broadcasting System -LRB- KBS -RRB- spokesman, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung-shik </PERSON>, rejected the opposition's charges. `` Our news and other programs are fair by any standard,'' he said. <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> has recently started some new programs, including talk shows to which opposition figures are regularly invited. Government officials say the criticism the networks may end after a neutral broadcasting committee is set up in June, as required by a new law, to nominate the heads of the two networks. Some opposition lawmakers will be appointed to serve on the committee to ensure fairness. The government is also preparing to inaugurate in March a new press law that would drop a requirement for government approval to start new newspapers or periodicals. Seven newspapers have so far applied to start publishing under the new law. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> now has 20 national daily newspapers with an estimated combined circulation of 12 million. The first beneficiary of the new law would be a newspaper that some 200 dissident journalists plan to publish this spring with support from 3,300 sponsors, including 1,000 college professors, 100 lawyers, 200 religious leaders and 200 literary figures. Song Kun-ho, president of the newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Hankyoreh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinmun </ORGANIZATION>, said the project will be started with 5 billion won -LRB- $ 6.8 million -RRB- to be raised through public shares. Song said 15,000 people have so far responded, contributing about half of the needed money. Song and the other journalists, dismissed from their previous jobs on grounds of anti-government activity, said their newspaper would emphasize human rights and spearhead press freedom. The influential <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> also has announced it will start a newspaper in April and set up a nationwide radio network in September. Critics of the government contend the new press law is restrictive because it stipulates that new newspapers must use certain kinds of presses that cost millions of dollars. They contend this would keep control of the press in the hands of establishment groups.

<HEAD>Danish Air Force May Take on Women as Fighter Pilots</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Katrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hvitved </PERSON>, a 16-year-old high school student, wrote an irate letter to a newspaper complaining that <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> air force discriminates against women and keeps her from fulfilling her dream of flying an F-16 jetfighter. But the air force has told her, maybe not. `` I would like to be a pilot, but ca n't be one in the military,'' she wrote to the newspaper <LOCATION> Jyllands-Posten </LOCATION>. `` It's unjust! Two weeks later, Defense Minister <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Collet </PERSON> replied to <PERSON> Katrine </PERSON> in a letter to the same newspaper saying an air force policy of keeping women from piloting military planes is under review and likely to change. Women are accepted in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s armed forces but they can not fly planes. <PERSON> Katrine </PERSON>, who specializes in science and mathematics at school, said by telephone from her home in the port city of <LOCATION> Aalborg </LOCATION> she was delighted with <PERSON> Collet </PERSON>'s response. `` I've been crazy about jet planes for years and enjoy visiting air force bases.'' But she added that she still has a problem. `` My parents would rather I stayed on the ground.'' Nevertheless, she's decided to join a parachutist's club. Last year the military began a study women pilots. Based mainly on the experiences of other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, the report is expected to be submitted to a parliamentary committee for action later this year. `` The military chiefs seem to be very positive towards the proposal,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the air force, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who deals with personnel. A decision to allow women into flight training would be in keeping with military policy laid down in 1980 of equal rights in all branches of the armed forces, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> added. Experiments since 1980 placing women in combat units have proven successful, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` The military has n't noticed any weakening of fighting strength in combat units with women in them.'' A total of 844 women, including 58 officers, were serving in all armed forces branches as of June last year, the date of the latest available statistics. They were in field units in the infantry, the tank corps, surface-to-air missile squadrons and base patrol duties. The navy has five women officers and 99 sailors. They serve on inspection vessels, corvettes and torpedo boats. But they are n't on submarines, where quarters are too close. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said he sees no problems for women as helicopter or transport plane pilots. But experts are still concerned about how women would stand up to the extreme gravitational forces experienced by pilots of supersonic jets. G-stress and speed and precision of reaction were problems for male fighter pilots, too, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, aspiring combat pilots go to a two-year civilian flight school supervised by the military before being sent to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for advanced training. `` Female pilot trainees will face the same physical and psychological demands that men do, and there will be no lowering of standards to get women in,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Nor would a woman's maritial status or the fact she had children be taken into account, he added. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> pointed out that in neighboring <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, where women already train as military pilots, only two out of 300 candidates have earned wings. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also have trained women pilots for their air forces.

<HEAD>Shortages of Cooking Oil and Sugar Rile Egyptians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts to bring peace to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, Egyptians are talking these days about shortages of cooking oil and sugar. It's angry talk. Cooking oil and sugar are important items on the Egyptian menu, used extensively by peasants who make up half the nation's 51 million people. Cooking oil is added to beans, which are eaten at breakfast and dinner, and used to fry vegetables, especially eggplant and potatoes, the usual peasant lunch. As for sugar, Egyptians consume so much in tea, pastries and candy that the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has begun a television campaign in an effort to persuade people that more than six lumps a day is harmful. The shortages have been assailed in the news media and heatedly discussed in coffee shops. The subject has come up in the <ORGANIZATION> Shura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a government body of experts in various fields who give advice to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and to the People's Assembly, the national legislature. And in the People's Assembly itself, Prime Minister <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> was taken to task because of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers had denied that the shortages exist. <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> admitted they were not being entirely candid, but he assured the assembly that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> once again will get by. Food shortages are nothing new to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The country must import 60 percent of what it eats and it does n't have the money to pay for all it needs. In addition, it increasingly has more mouths than it can feed, as the population explodes at a rate of 1 million every nine months. That coupled with stagnant food production has transformed the country from the food exporter it was three decades ago to the importer it is today. The nation, facing a foreign debt of $ 44 billion, does n't have the money to pay for it all. Nobody has a ready solution. Increasing food production is n't easy because only about 4 percent of the country's land area, the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, is fertile, and little money is available to reclaim and cultivate the desert <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is among the world's biggest producers of cotton, which is the source of most cooking oil used in the country, but it must import more than 80 percent of its needs _ at a cost of $ 250 million a year. `` We import 500,000 tons of cooking oil, at the cost of $ 500 a ton,'' said <PERSON> Rifaat </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadawy </PERSON>, an official in charge of oil imports at the <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` So the cooking oil crisis is connected with the foreign exchange crisis, and any shortage in foreign currency means a shortage of providing cooking oil for local consumption.'' Similarily, despite expanses of sugar cane in central <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the country's farmers produce only about half the nation's needs, forcing imports of 700,000 tons for almost $ 158 million last year. A further complication is that many stable foods are distributed through expensive subsidy and ration systems. Under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and at the urging of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the government has been trying to reduce the subsidy systems' burden on the national <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. For the past two years, it has tapered off the number of subsidized items available at government stores or purchased with ration cards from private markets. But the items taken off the list cost much more. Despite the cutbacks, the government spent $ 2.2 billion in the 1986-87 fiscal year on subsidies for food and other items. That's only $ 675 million less than the subsidy bill in 1983-84 and remains much higher than levels <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> want The government does not want to eliminate or sharply reduce subsidies because it fears a recurrence of food riots in which more than 70 people were killed in 1977. For peasants like <PERSON> Nawal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamedein </PERSON>, who lives at el-Faronia, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, the system is not working. `` The official price of a one-kilogram -LRB- 2.2-pound -RRB- bottle of oil was 80 piasters -LRB- 36 cents, -RRB- but now it is not available in the shops,'' she said. `` I buy it off the black market for 3.5 pounds -LRB- $ 1.60 -RRB- a bottle. It has limited our food to next to nothing.'' She said she now has to serve bread and cheese for the midday meal in place of the usual eggplant and potatoes.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ When presidential aspirant <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> was caught in rhetorical plumage borrowed from a British politician, an uproar ensued. But how many candidates or other movers and shakers write their own speeches and quip their own quips? Their eloquence is manufactured by self-effacing, anonymous ghosts, who work overtime in an election year.

 `` No one,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON> said, `` can write an authentic speech for another man. It is as impossible as writing his love letters for him or saying his prayers for him. `` When he speaks to the people, he and not someone else must speak. For it is much more important that he is genuine ... than that he be bright, clever, ingenious, entertaining, eloquent or even grammatical.'' No specialized talent is required, <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON> said. `` Anyone who knows what he is doing can say what he is doing, and anyone who knows what he thinks can say what he thinks.'' <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON> was an important columnist whose judgments were closely attended by presidents, tycoons and other pillars of power. But on the matter of speech writing, no oracle was ever more widely ignored, then or now. Especially now, an election year, when the full monsoon is upon us. Never were more people cleaving the air with more speeches written by other people. In the stupefying war of words, 12 of the 13 original candidates for president used at least one mercenary each, as do most senators, representatives, governors, mayors, bank presidents, tycoons and assistant tycoons. Humble <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> has no speech writer. The Super Bowl, of course, is the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has five full-time writers, four researchers and assorted free-lance specialists to help him with a portentous speech on the crisis in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or Wall Street, with a one-liner for reporters, a tidbit for a tete-a-tete with visting royalty in the Rose Garden, an inspiring sermon on the State of the Union, taped birthday greetings for <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a proclamation summoning the attention of his countrymen to Dairy Goat Awareness Week. For three days of summitry with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the boys in the back room provided the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Communicator </LOCATION> with warm words of welcome and farewell, one treaty signing statement, one evening broadcast, two dinner toasts and nine Russian proverbs for targets of opportunity. -LRB- He used seven. -RRB- Cooling or thawing, the Cold War is fought with the menace of vast armadas of planes, aircraft carriers, submarines, guided missiles, nuclear bombs and speech writers. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> wrote for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> wrote for <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. They met for the first time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two years ago. `` In effect, we have met before,'' said <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>. `` We have corresponded.'' `` Really?'' `` You helped write President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s messages during the missile crisis. I helped write Chairman <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s answers.'' Eyeball to eyeball, typewriter to typewriter, the twain met. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Safire </PERSON> wrote for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornienko </PERSON> wrote for <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. In 1972, in the Great Hall of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, after the signing of the first treaty limiting strategic weapons, the writers sat side by side basking in the warm glow of the toasts they had written for the two world leaders. <PERSON> Kornienko </PERSON>, particularly, basked during <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s delivery of his toast. `` Can you not hear the steps of history going by us?'' he whispered to <PERSON> Safire </PERSON>, ghost to ghost. The example may be Russian rococo but it is history, they say, that lures perspiring writers to aspiring presidents. The chance that one day their words may soar out of the Oval Office or a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the fuel propelling most of the practitioners now pounding typewriters in planes, trains, buses, cars, motel rooms, bathrooms and the dank wings of theaters. The hope of marble sustains them in their frantic anonymity. Ever after their words become history, a curious honor code prevails among presidential speech writers. Even at this late date, neither <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> will tell you which golden phrases he crafted for <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. It was years before we learned that honest <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> got help on his farewell address from three ghosts named <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Safire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> reveal nothing about the language they supplied <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> or <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but on a vice presidential level they have confessed their connection with the `` pusillanimous pussyfooters'' and `` nattering nabobs of negativism'' immortalized by <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>. Among <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s writers, the vow of silence was particularly easy to observe after his speech before a distinguished audience in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. None was tempted to rush forward to claim authorship of his jocular remarks about jogging in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because of `` Montezuma's revenge.'' Besides his humor, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s writers worried about twists of his tongue. To their horror, in a major speech, they heard him identify a huge block of voters as `` eyetalians'' and one of the party's saints as `` <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornblower </PERSON>'' -LRB- nee <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s writers tried to keep him away from `` judgment,'' which he insisted on making `` judg-a-ment.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s writers luxuriate in his masterful delivery of their lines but their ulcers stir when he strays from the text. At such times, he has been known to come up with a statistic or item unchecked by White House researchers which later requires correction. This president literally saves his own supply of speech goodies in a shoe box. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s staff worries most about his wit, which seems clearly the best among the candidates _ but unreined lunges for the jugular. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two writers tense up when he ad-libs something folksy. Trying to explain why he did poorly in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> straw poll, the vice president said his supporters were probably busy that day with other things, like a daughter's coming out party. This in a state gloomy with farm foreclosures.

 `` We're paid for our anonymity,'' said <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Parvis </PERSON>, one of the busiest ghostwriters around. `` It's almost like a doctor-patient relationship.'' Never was that confidentiality more strictly obeyed than in the presidential demise of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. His writers said nothing. Asking them was like asking a team of surgeons which one killed the patient. `` I made some mistakes,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said without further explanation of the mysterious osmosis by which the same words, images and family memories traveled incognito from <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, who wanted to be prime minister of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who wanted to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Safire </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> columnist and reigning scholar on speechmanship, thinks <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> may have suffered self-hynosis in the wearying blur of the campaign and began to believe that <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s thoughts were his thoughts <PERSON> Safire </PERSON> points out that he and other presidential writers over the years have borrowed speech patterns and rhythms from each other without attribution. He does concede that <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s loan was a case of `` heavy lifting.'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> asked what difference does it make, anyway? Most candidates and many politicians use speech writers. Is it more moral to buy a speech and claim it as your own than to steal it? In the flurry of charge and counter-charge, only <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> appeared safely immune among the candidates. Who would think to accuse him of literary theft, this square-jawed warrior who fires his crossbow at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for `` Cheshire-catting,'' who rises fearlessly against `` bureaucratic amoking'' and is ready to `` caveat that'' or `` context this''? <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, the president who delivered the greatest speeches, wrote his own. Of the two best orators of their time, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> used a phalanx of ghosts and envied <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> for being able to write his own. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s three helpers went on to become presidents themselves. No presidential writer since has done quite as well, although <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welliver </PERSON> now enjoys something of a revival more than 60 years after his time. There is now a <ORGANIZATION> Judson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welliver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of former White House writers. Who, you may well ask, was <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welliver </PERSON>? He's the fellow who went to work for <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> as a `` literary clerk'' and became the first full-time presidential ghost in history. He also wrote for <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>. To no avail. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Longworth </PERSON> still thought of <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> as someone `` weaned on a pickle.'' Speech writers are torn by a conflict of code and ego. They readily tell you that as a result of getting to know their man, his ideas, tastes and speech patterns, the text they finally give him is basically `` his.'' This is their answer to <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON>. The words may be theirs; the thinking is the client's. Also, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrum </PERSON>, who writes for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would scarcely approve of their busy president consuming three days to write a speech. But the hired hands also yearn for a statute of limitations on the law of silence so that students of history will know who wrote what. A writer and his words are not soon parted. At <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s first inaugural, <PERSON> Safire </PERSON> found himself wandering around the edge of the crowd silently mouthing his lines as the president spoke them. Embarrassed, he moved on and there was <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> mouthing his lines. All agree it would be difficult to write for someone they disliked. In this respect, the busiest is the most ecumenical; <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Parvin </PERSON> writes for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, corporate heads, other Republicans AND some Democrats who suit his ideology but would n't care to have that public. Last year, <PERSON> Parvin </PERSON>'s work for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ran the gamut from the solemnity of major speeches on Iran-Contra and AIDS to scores of one-liners on the order of: `` It's true hard work never killed anybody, but I figure why take the chance.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a city that consumes humor almost as fast as taxes. Candidates, officeholders, lobbyists and rising bureaucrats hunger for it. The <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON> have been known to call a comic off the floor of a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> nightclub for a quick fix for the Gridiron and other local festivals. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, columnist and occasional supplier, notes changes in the humor market: `` We're not nearly as ethnic. There are no <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> or <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> stories being told. The one group you can make fun of is the WASPS. You can do ` Quiche is their idea of soul food' or ` They tailgated during the war of 1812.' There is no Episcopalian Anti-Defamation League.'' There is a legend among speech writers which they doubt is true but they tell it with a relish that suggests their own <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitty </PERSON> dreams. It concerns an intense president who could be sweetly benign or thunderously abusive. After two years of that, one writer snapped. And so: The president was rushing out to the Rose Garden for a routine appearance. He scooped up the speech cards handed him by the writer and without reading them first the Leader of the Western World sallied forth: `` There are those who say we ca n't fulfill the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> program and fight the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at the same time. They're wrong and I'm going to tell you why There are those who say we ca n't feed the hungry at home and also lift living standards around the world. They are wrong and I'm going to tell you why.'' Two more such refrains and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was now ready to tell them why. Then, he turned to the last card and found only this: `` Now you're on your own.''

 Virologists have learned a lot about their enemy, the AIDS bug. It is devious and elusive, stunningly elaborate, yet self-controlled, even finicky. It insinuates itself into the body's blueprints, its genes. It stays there forever. No one can imagine a way to get rid of it. In its sly way, the virus does nothing outwardly bad at first. For five years, 10 years or longer, it may burrow deep, hiding, making a grudgingly slow stream of new copies of itself. The body's half-hearted attempt to kill it gets nowhere And the virus's unsuspecting host feels fine But something evil is happening. The immune system is eroding. Then, as though responding to some signal, the virus springs furiously to life. It replicates at an astonishing rate. And it wipes out one brand of blood cell that is essential for health and life. Everyone agrees: HIV is an impressive foe. Genes with names like tat and art rev it up and dampen it down. With each new discovery of its florid system of checks and balances, with each new example of the virus's guile, the AIDS story seems only to get worse. This is a virus like no other. It is designed through evolution to elude the body's own defenses, the blood-borne radar and missiles of its immune system. Worse, it is designed to attack that system and destroy it. In time, it does. `` It is what it is, and we are beginning to understand it,'' says Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` What we should understand is how bad it is. The news is very bad, and it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.'' Yet <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> and others who dissect the germ's inner machinery say that what they see there also gives them reason to be optimistic. There is plenty to go wrong. The immediate goal of their work is to figure out how the virus works. How it latches onto its target. How it gets inside. How it takes over and makes new copies of itself. How it kills. Each step requires a tightly choreographed ballet between the virus's own genes and the chemicals it makes _ an ornate, even beautiful, interplay of molecular thermostats and feedback loops that nudge the virus to life, fire it up and quiet it down. Surely, the experts reason, anything so complicated must be ripe for sabotage. `` If one knows the critical steps in virus replication, then strategies to interfere with those steps would be useful,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong-Staal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` In AIDS, you constantly need recruitment of new infected cells for the immune system to be totally suppressed. So any way of blocking new infection is important, and therefore interfering with the life cycle is important.'' By <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON>'s count, the virus makes at least 13 proteins that are potential targets for drugs. `` The idea,'' he says, `` is that when we learn enough about their three-dimensional structure, we will be able to design drugs by synthetic chemistry to fit into their little niches and crannies and stop them from working.'' Labs headed by <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wong-Staal </PERSON>, a colleague of HIV co-discoverer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, made many of the key early discoveries of how HIV works, and they have been joined by several other groups in picking apart the virus. New details pile up quickly. From this investigation, a profile of the enemy emerges. AIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but in its short history, that name has already become outdated. AIDS is not just a collection of symptoms but a disease with a clear cause, a microbe called HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. The virus lives in the body's fluids _ blood, semen and vaginal secretions, among others. Naked virus floats about freely in these liquids, but it's also carried about inside white blood cells. Among the most plentiful of these infected cells are monocytes and macrophages, scavengers that eat bacteria and other bits of useless and dangerous matter. AIDS spreads when the free virus or infected cells pass from one person to another. Blood-contaminated hypodermic needles can carry them directly into the bloodstream. More often, however, the virus is passed during sexual intercourse, perhaps when virus-laden blood cells cross the mucous membranes of the genitals.

 Ordinarily, such tainted cells display an alien protein on their surface. It serves as a sort of badge declaring, `` I'm infected.'' But in one of its many tricks, the AIDS virus circumvents this convention. Some of these infected macrophages are filled with thousands of viruses, but they are Trojan horses that give no warning of their cargo. The body, unconcerned, mounts no defense _ even if such a defense would do any good, which, apparently, it does not. Once inside, the infected cells bump into healthy ones and pass along their contents. Within days, the virus is established in tissues throughout the body. Several kinds of cells eventually get infected, including brain cells, B cells that make antibodies and <PERSON> Langerhans </PERSON> cells, a form of macrophage that penetrates most of the body's tissues and lives for decades. All of them have one thing in common: Their outer skin contains a molecule called T4. Among them, one variety of blood cell is special. It is covered with so much T4 that it's called a T4 helper cell. A single cell may be coated with 60,000 T4 molecules. Of all the cells that the virus enters and subverts, the T4 helper cell is the only one it kills directly. Unfortunately, the helper cell is a critically important soldier in the body's microbial warfare It's a kind of master cell that oversees other branches of the immune system, coordinating their response to germs. Without them, this intricate system becomes chaotic, aimless. Parasites that ordinarily do n't stand a chance run rampant. Overwhelming infection and death are the unstoppable consequences. But this final stage of the infection, the phase called AIDS, may come a decade or more after those first infected macrophages cross into their new host's bloodstream, full of virus looking for T4. At first, the virus replicates quickly. Large amounts of it are found in the central nervous system, then in the blood and finally in other secretions. For a few weeks, the victim may feel sick with aches and ills that mimic mononucleosis. But then the symptoms clear up. Production of virus drops to a trace. Now the person is an AIDS carrier, able to pass the infection on the others but looking and feeling perfectly normal. For several years, it may seem as though nothing is wrong. But that is an illusion. `` Something is happening during that asymptomatic period that eventually results in enough damage that the whole system collapses,'' says <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON>. `` I think of it as a dam eroding. The damage is being done, but the dam looks fine.'' At last the virus comes to life. Levels rise in the bloodstream. T4 helper cells start to die. And the symptoms of AIDS set in. Within about two years after those symptoms appear, the number of T4 cells in the blood inexorably drops to near zero. How does HIV get away with it? In the usual course of viral surveillance, the branch of the immune system called the B cells recognizes the invader for what it is and makes antibodies. These are chemicals that tightly latch onto specific spots on the virus's surface and mark it for destruction People make antibodies against the AIDS virus, too. But they do n't stop the bug. Scientists are n't sure why, although they have some theories. Perhaps the spots the antibodies need to attach themselves to are hidden deep in recesses in the virus's coat. Perhaps they're disguised with a covering of sugar. Maybe the antibodies bind to the wrong spot on the virus, failing to harm it. Or maybe the virus simply stays one step ahead, mutating its shell faster than the body can fashion new antibodies to fit it. The virus's coat is made of a sugar and protein combination, or glycoprotein, called the envelop protein. It has two parts. The inner one, called gp41, is imbedded in the surface of the virus. Loosely attached to gp41 is the outer envelop protein, called gp120. Gp120 has an intense attraction for the T4 molecule on human cells. When it finds this target, it binds tightly, holding the tiny virus to the rough surface of the much larger cell. Then the gp41 takes over and fuses the membranes of the virus and the cell, allowing the inner part of the virus to enter the cell. Its goal now is to splice its own genes into those of the cell so it can turn the cell into a virus factory, manufacturing thousands upon thousands of new copies of itself. For HIV, however, that's even more difficult than it sounds, for this bug is a retrovirus. Like all creatures in nature, the assembly plans for a new AIDS virus are contained in the coded material called genes.

<HEAD>BOSTON: called genes.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The genes of people, spiders, mushrooms and most everything else are made of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Each gene contains the code for assembling a protein that's used to build or regulate the organism. When its protein is needed, the gene spins off a mirror image of itself in a substance called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. The RNA is shuttled to the cell's protein assembly factory, where it serves as a temporary blueprint. Retrovirus genes are backwards. They are made of RNA. To get going, the virus has to translate them into DNA. This is the job of enzymes made by a gene called pol. Like other retroviruses, HIV has three basic genes. Besides pol, they are env, which makes gp120 and gp41 to form the outer shell, and gag, which creates the protein needed for the virus's inner core. However, unlike simple retroviruses, HIV has at least four regulatory genes and probably more. They are called tat, art, sor and 3 ` Even though scientists have worked out the entire genetic code of the AIDS virus's RNA, they are not sure how many genes are involved in all. Some of them overlap, sharing stretches of RNA, while other genes are spliced together from here and there along the strand of RNA. The pol gene produces polymerase and ribonuclease H, known jointly as reverse transcriptase, as well as protease and integrase. Together, these enzymes transcribe RNA into DNA, clean it up, and insert it neatly into the cell's own genes, where it becomes a permanent part of the body's genetic library. All the pieces are in place for the virus to instruct the cell to turn its attention toward making and assembling viral proteins. In T4 helper cells, however, this usually does n't happen. Even though one in five of them may be infected, only about one in 10,000 is actually producing viral proteins. In the rest of them, the virus lies quiet, or latent. It can come to life only when the T4 helper cell itself is stimulated by some immunological emergency to divide and produce new cells. This is not true of monocytes and macrophages. In these cells, the virus can make a slow, steady stream of new viruses or suddenly explode with activity. But whether any of these infected cells actually churn out new viruses depends on an intricate interplay between the virus's regulatory genes. Among the most intriguing of these is tat. It's a kind of fast-forward switch. <ORGANIZATION> Tat </ORGANIZATION> produces a protein that causes the other genes to work faster. It can speed up virus production 1,000-fold. The tat protein even makes the tat gene work harder. It becomes a positive feedback regulator, triggering runaway viral production. However, tat has an alter ego called 3 ` orf -LRB- pronounced three-prime-orf It slows down virus replication, and it may be one way that the virus establishes latent infection. Another way is through the art gene, also known as trs. Art is a kind of switch. When art is turned on, the virus makes the structural proteins necessary for constructing new copies of itself. But when art is turned off, it makes only the regulatory proteins. Finally, there is sor. Its protein somehow makes the virus more infectious, so it spreads more rapidly through the body. Using these genes, HIV transforms useful cells into virus factories. Most of the infected cells survive, even though they are making virus. However, the T4 helper cells eventually die, and they are killed in two ways. When cells are infected with HIV, they often display copies of the virus's envelop protein on their own surface. The envelop protein is highly attracted to the T4 molecule. This turns the infected cell in a sort of giant virus, roaming the bloodstream in search of cells with T4 on them. When it finds one, it sticks to it. This results in clumps of 100 to 500 cells known as syncytia, and all of them eventually die. The T4 helper cells may also die through a process called autofusion. The surfaces of these cells contain so much envelop protein and T4 that its skin folds over onto itself and sticks together. Each place that envelop protein and T4 touch, a hole is punched. The cell grows leaky and explodes. How did HIV get to be such an efficient killer? Probably by accident. Most viruses, whether they cause flu, cold sores or warts, do n't kill their hosts A dead host, after all, is a very poor host. Instead, they cause passing illnesses or lifelong infections that may be aggravating but are n't lethal. `` The AIDS epidemic is just a slight miscalculation on the virus's part,'' <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> says. `` It could be a single mutation in almost any one of the regulatory pathways. It allows it to make too much virus too quickly in T4 cells, and that allows it to be more easily transmitted and more lethal. It could be one single mutation that separates us from no epidemic and this terrible epidemic.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ They call it <LOCATION> Treasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> of the Orient, and tout it as a place where smart investors can get rich, thanks to its mineral deposits, sparkling beaches, and other resources. Unabashed free enterprise is the name of the game, in the new Chinese style.

 Dominating a wall of the <LOCATION> Qiongyuan </LOCATION> restaurant in this capital of tropical <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is an eye-catching red shrine to Caishen, the traditional god of wealth. The figurine, explained a waitress, was expected to bring prosperity to the restaurant. It appeared to be working. The room was jammed with high-spending customers gulping bottles of beer to wash down earthworms cooked with golden mushrooms and other specialties. Open worship of <LOCATION> Caishen </LOCATION> in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would have been unthinkable not too long ago, but today seems perfectly appropriate on this lightly developed but resource-rich island, which is to be the biggest proving ground yet for the country's capitalist-style economic reforms. Chinese leaders last year promised to offer a slew of incentives to speed development and attract much-coveted foreign investment to this island off <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southernmost coast, between the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Since mid-1987, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> media has breathlessly reported almost daily on the big plans for the island. `` ` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> of Orient' a Vast Building Site'' said one recent headline in the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily New highways, deep-water ports, airports, railways and power stations are promised. Official reports in early 1988 indicate that a nuclear power plant could be in the cards. `` All projects that are helpful to the island's economic development will be encouraged,'' said <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Qinghai </PERSON>, vice-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hainan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The Chinese leadership views the iron, rubber, copper, oil and other natural resources found throughout the 13,568-square-mile island _ nearly twice the land mass of the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> _ as a magnet for foreign investors. They also hope the sparkling white beaches that seductively curve for miles on end along the island's southern coast will attract foreign tourists to a <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The island _ which local officials often refer to as ` baodao,' or Treasure Island _ is to become <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 31st province this spring as a sign of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s serious intentions to bring <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> into the modern world. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s bold plans, if carried through, could mean profound changes for the population of about 6 million people, many of whom remain firmly planted in the past. <PERSON> Hainan </PERSON>'s people work the water and land in timeless fashion; wooden fishing junks crowd the main harbors while peasants work small rice paddies with simple plows pulled by water buffalo. Others cultivate fields of sugar cane, coffee, pepper, pineapple and tea that dot the lush countryside. In the capital city of <LOCATION> Haikou </LOCATION>, population about 300,000, the central district's streets are lined with worn two-story buildings that date from the early decades of the century. In the countryside, some peasants live in huts of baked mud and straw and go without electricity. Nearly four decades of Communist rule has failed to quash ancestor worship and the belief in spirits. For example, clansmen accompanied by musicians with horns, drums, gongs and cymbals can be seen walking in procession down the island's main road in a ceremony to implore their long-deceased ancestors to return home. In the mountainous region of the island's interior, the Li ethnic minority still send off their dead amid elaborate rituals that include burials peppered by the noise of firecrackers and vintage flintlock rifles and by drinking parties at which rice wine flows for several days and nights. The people understand their backwater island is to become a `` special economic zone'' _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s name for regions where economic practices can stray from the Marxist straight and narrow to spur development _ and hope it will mean more money. `` We're very happy'' about the plan, says a man surnamed <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> who earns $ 16 a month at a <LOCATION> Haikou </LOCATION> firecracker store. `` Our standard of living will go up, our wages will go up.'' An employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Xinglong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION>, taking a brief pause from burning brush to speak with visitors, said she believed that in the future `` our wages will rise and so will prices.''

 But scholar <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Youjing </PERSON>, a 23-year-old researcher of <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION>'s minorities, said he was unimpressed with government efforts to build up the area Speaking in <LOCATION> Tongza </LOCATION>, the minority region's central city where markets are well-stocked and apartment buildings are popping up all over, <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said the government had neglected the countryside. `` I know what I'm going to say will bring me trouble,'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, said intently within earshot of a foreign affairs official. `` The central government has spent a lot of money to put up buildings and give outsiders the impression of a flourishing and rich -LRB- minority -RRB- area. `` But in reality, the people's standard of living is very low. The central government is not providing money to improve the standard of living'' in areas far from the view of visitors, he said. Whether <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s grandiose plans for <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> development will be realized remains to be seen. The record of the four existing special economic zones along <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southern coast _ all much smaller than <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> geographically _ is mixed. In <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, nine years of special status has transformed a sleepy rural area into a boom town of half a million people. But development has been haphazard and the economic incentives offered foreign developers has attracted primarily basic assembly plants instead of high-technology industry. And Chinese authorities are painfully aware that a previous effort to build up <PERSON> Hainan </PERSON>'s economy led to a widespread racketeering scandal three years ago. From 1980, <PERSON> Hainan </PERSON> was allowed to import duty-free vehicles and 16 other luxury goods for its own use to help speed development. But with the complicity of local authorities, enterprises from kindergartens, banks and newspapers turned themselves into importers and resold the goods to the Chinese mainland. The trade in 3.3 million cars, color television sets, video recorders and motorcycles lined the pockets of individuals and enterprises with millions of illegally earned dollars. This time, authorities warn, such behavior will not be tolerated. `` Our policy is that getting rich through labor is glorious. However, you should get rich according to our policies,'' <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> party official <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenxu </PERSON> explained at a news conference in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last year. Officials say those policies will include offering 50-year leases on land, relaxing foreign currency controls, waiving duties on imported production material and granting the new province decision-making autonomy. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said that details of the vague promises will be announced this year. Reported plans to build a modern infrastructure have been vague, too, although some financing details have started to surface. For example, about $ 100 million in <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans are to go to construct the <LOCATION> Daguang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hydropower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, which is expected to generate 240,000 kilowatts of electricity and irrigate about 164,500 acres of farmland by 1990, a press report said. The need for a stable electricity supply was made clear to visitors recently when power outages occurred three evenings in a recent week at one of <LOCATION> Haikou </LOCATION>'s pricier hotels. Foreigners, whose investments and know-how are urgently needed to develop the island, remain largely skeptical. Slowly, however, development is stirring. New hotels geared to overseas visitors are going up, many in recent weeks. By the end of 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, foreign businessmen signed more than 200 contracts committing more than $ 80 million joint ventures, co-operative enterprises and factories. Many Chinese from the mainland believe <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> is the place to be and are applying to move to the island by the tens of thousands, officials say. `` This is an open place that has a future,'' said one young doctor who traveled 800 miles from <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province to seek a job at a local hospital. But his chance of success was slim, he said while relaxing at a seaside tourist area, because `` too many people are applying.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ A sharp drop in box-office sales is putting a lot of French movie theaters out of business in a country where cinema is a national passion. Film directors say they're keeping busy, but, in the words of one, `` Any director who shuns television is a dead man.''

 Film directors here, who regard reports of the death of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cinema as highly exaggerated, have not slowed their pace: They make a movie every three days, as many as the Americans. `` Crisis, crisis,'' mocks <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lelouch </PERSON>, who is spending $ 10 million on a <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> film he wants to premiere in Madison Square Garden. `` All this whining is ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>, another Frenchman with an Oscar, laughs, `` You think there is a crisis? Try to find a cameraman. Or an actor. They're all busy, and their prices go up every day.'' Talk of crisis followed a year of mediocre films and a 20 percent drop in box-office sales in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A revolution in French television means six channels show 1,200 films a year. Video rentals are up. Directors say that is a challenge to make spectacular or imaginative films to lure couch potatoes back into theaters. In any case, they add, television is just another branch of the business. `` This is a problem of theater owners, not filmmakers,'' <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> says. `` I may be sad that people see my work on a little box instead of a screen, but I do n't feel I'll lose my job if cinemas close.'' Few directors seem endangered in a country where the film industry is a national obsession. French filmmakers, in a nation of 55 million, earn 10 percent of world box-office receipts. The range is wide. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Truffautdied </PERSON> in 1986, but every other major director of the 1950's New Wave is still making movies. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON> does two a year. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohmer </PERSON>, at 67, works hard on tiny budgets. <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Godard </PERSON>, an aging rebel loved mainly by critics, just brought out `` Soigne Ta Droite'' -LRB- Watch Your Right -RRB-, a metaphysical meander in the mind of a director trying to make a film to order. At the other extreme, hot young comers like <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Besson </PERSON> -LRB- `` Subway'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Leos </PERSON> <PERSON> Carax </PERSON> -LRB- `` Mauvais Sang,'' or Bad Blood -RRB- are trying to solidify success from their early films. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON>, after slowing down in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, came home to make a smash hit: `` Au Revoir, les Enfants'' -LRB- Goodbye, Children -RRB-, about kids deported by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavernier </PERSON>, finished with `` Round Midnight,'' returned to do `` La Passion Beatrice,'' a hard saga of incest and violence set in a corner of 14th century <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pialat </PERSON>'s `` Sous le Soleil de Satan'' -LRB- Under Satan's Sun -RRB- was the first French entry to win the best-film award since <PERSON> Lelouch </PERSON>'s `` A Man and a Woman'' 20 years ago. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s back-to-back films about the disappearing <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> peasantry, `` Jean de Florette'' and `` <PERSON> Manon </PERSON> des Sources,'' were successes even in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping mall cinemas. So were `` Diva'' and `` Betty Blue'' by <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Beneix </PERSON>. `` There is no reason not to be optimistic,'' says <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubiana </PERSON>, editor of the prestigious Cahiers du Cinema. `` Some fine films are being made.'' Plenty of money is available, <PERSON> Tubiana </PERSON> says, but a new breed of businessmen-producers do not know how to spend it. He says it will take time for television executives to learn to wield their power. For example, no one would touch <PERSON> Coline </PERSON> <PERSON> Serreau </PERSON>'s `` Trois Hommes et un <PERSON> Couffin </PERSON>.'' It was a smash when someone finally did. As `` Three Men and a Baby,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> remake grossed $ 70 million in 1987. The state works hard to assure a steady crop of filmmakers. Its influential academy, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, turns away three times more students than it accepts. `` The tendency among younger people is toward the classical, the old styles,'' says <PERSON> Solveig </PERSON> <PERSON> Anspach </PERSON>, an IDHEC student. `` I do n't see any worry about the future.'' She said her class is 40 percent women, a level that few would have believed possible a decade ago. `` It is not easy for a young director to find backing, but if you have a good idea, and you are determined, you can do it,'' said <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Casabianca </PERSON>, whose `` <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>,'' won praise. Any director with a screenplay can apply for an advance from the state-supported <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which takes a cut of box-office receipts. Private money is often available. But successful filmmakers like <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> prefer to cross borders, breaking out of the limited French market. His `` Name of the Rose,'' was based on an Italian novel, with English actors and German money. The script was written in English and French. He shot the film in English and dubbed it for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I would much rather spend $ 25 million for the international market than $ 3 million for only <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` The risk is less because of the percentages.'' Crossing cultures can be risky. <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> won an Academy Award for foreign films with `` Black and White in Color.'' But the film ridiculed colonialism, and it flopped among the sensitive French. <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> is unperturbed by a dearth of French stars. Directors fight over the bearlike <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Depardieu </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>'s next film stars a real bear. Called `` l'Ours'' -LRB- The Bear -RRB-, it looks at hunting from the viewpoint of a <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> cub. <PERSON> Lelouch </PERSON> corraled <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON>, fresh from a hit theater run in `` <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>.'' He plays a 50-year-old adventurer, the world's ninth richest man, who grew up in a circus and trots the globe taming lions and women. It is called, `` l'Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate,'' meaning, the Journeys of a Spoiled Brat. The director, who not coincidentally just turned 50, wants to present the film on a 7,500-square-foot screen at the <LOCATION> Bercy </LOCATION> sports complex in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Then, for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, at Madison Square Garden. `` We have to find new limits, new ideas that become possible as the technology develops,'' <PERSON> Lelouch </PERSON> says. `` I hope in my lifetime I can film the picture that keeps turning in my head.'' He pursued his theme: `` There is always something better, bigger, more interesting to do. I can imagine films being shown all over the world at the same time, on a sort of pay-TV system, which would earn enough to allow us to do anything. `` You have to adapt and improve with the means. Any director today who shuns television is a dead man.'' <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>, a different sort of filmmaker, agreed with <PERSON> Lelouch </PERSON>. `` Where is the conflict?'' he reflected. `` It is like concerts and records. Why do some people go to a concert hall instead of buying a compact disc? In the end, it is the same.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The traditional 27-piece brass band so common in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> almost faded from the American scene after World War II. But since a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> conductor formed the <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago, the brass sound has been on the rebound.

 Call it the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION> in brass or the common man's symphony. But, please, says conductor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernat </PERSON>, do n't call it `` oompah. The bright, upbeat music of the 27-piece, British-style <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Band </LOCATION> is leading a modest grass-roots revival of a tradition that peaked at the turn of the century. `` It's just a great big, juicy, fat sound,'' <PERSON> Bernat </PERSON> says. The conductor says people are surprised the band plays popular and contemporary songs, classics and folk tunes, not just marches and what he calls `` oompah.'' `` When they think of brass bands, oompah is what people usually think of,'' he says. `` That's German beer garden music, lee-dee-dee-duh-oom-pah-pah. And we do that sometimes.'' <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> features two percussionists and 25 brass horns, including 10 cornets, four tubas, three trombones, three horns, two euphoniums a recent sold-out performance at a suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> middle school, the band played music written by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>. The audience chose <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>'s `` The Thunderer'' for the encore, clapping loudly with the march, tapping their feet and rocking in their seats. `` There's a certain type of march that when you play the audience goes mad,'' <PERSON> Bernat </PERSON> says. `` The audience's reaction is predictable.'' Most shows also feature a sing-along. `` They come to our concert and they just let it go,'' says <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, solo cornet player. `` They can sit there and stamp their feet and clap their hands and whistle. I've never heard that many people, 1,500 people, in church singing together something like ` Let Me Call You Sweetheart.''' `` Bob turns around and conducts them like the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pops </ORGANIZATION>,'' he says. `` It just sort of puts you on a high,'' says concert fan <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McBriar </PERSON>. `` The music is so exciting. It's so American. You connect bands with parades. I love a parade and that's what brass bands remind me of.'' <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s subscribers have grown from about 85 in 1981 to more than 2,600 this season and the band is debt-free for the first time, says General Manager <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON>. But popular appeal has come sooner than critical acclaim. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Council of The Arts, for example, has limited its funding of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because it does not consider brass band music a form of art. `` Band music is an entertainment form,'' says <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, music director for the council. `` It's in the context that band music is meant for parks and orchestral music is fine art and meant for a different audience.'' <PERSON> Droste </PERSON> says the main difference is that a brass band appeals to everyone and plays a greater variety of music. `` It's a very eclectic mix and though it's a grass-roots movement, the standards are very high,'' he says. `` We appeal to the common man, the man in the street. `` It would be very difficult to find a better band than the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Band </LOCATION>. They would compare very favorably with the top brass bands in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where they have the best brass bands in the world.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a free-lance musician who has played trombone with the band for about five years, says he underestimated the brass band. `` When I got the announcement of the brass band tryouts, I said, ` Come on, you ca n't be serious,''' he says. `` I've learned it's a very serious thing.'' <PERSON> Bernat </PERSON> says a `` significant stamp of approval'' came when the band recently was chosen to perform in 11 Australian cities in March during the 1988 Australian bicentennial celebration, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Twyla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. At home, <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> performs a 28-concert subscription series in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s lavish Carnegie Hall and in an old movie theater and two suburban schools. It has toured about 15 states. `` We get out to the audience rather than trying to get the audience to come out to us,'' <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> says. `` It has that whole ` Music Man' feeling, that they can have this right here in river city.'' <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> said all kinds of people attend concerts. But at the city's <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, `` it's fur coats and CEOs and the kind of people you see at the symphony.''

 As <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> in the CBS miniseries `` Bluegrass,'' former `` Charlie's Angel'' <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> is a woman out for revenge, success, her own horse farm and a winner at the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION>. This being television and the windup of the February ratings sweeps, the two-part series, to be shown Sunday and Monday, also is rife with intrigue, back-stabbing, and social climbing. There are lots of blue skies and green pastures, beautiful horses and a rousing finale at <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Downs </LOCATION>. `` I play a woman who was raised in the area but is forced to leave after her father is accused of burning a barn,'' <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> says. `` He was the farm manager and he took the blame for the son. The son also tries to rape me at the beginning of the picture. He's played by <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. Laughing, she adds, `` He's so charming. You just know he's a snake.'' `` Bluegrass,'' from a novel by <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> <PERSON> Deal </PERSON>, also stars <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shawnee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. Filmed entirely on location around <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, it was directed by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wincer </PERSON>, who also directed the Australian movie about horse racing, `` Phar Lap.'' `` Maude is a kind of steel magnolia,'' <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> says. `` I liked her because of that. She's pretty determined to do it her own way. I liked that, too. I liked that she's not afraid to get her hands dirty. She can dress up, then turn around and put on jeans and muck up a horse stall. `` She's an underdog. I think a lot of people will be rooting for her. I grew up in a small town in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. My aunt had a farm and my grandfather lived in an even smaller town. I can identify with these kind of people. And my husband and I have a quarter horse ranch in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, so I know something about horses, too.'' `` Bluegrass'' opens with some brief scenes that show <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> as a teen-ager and the unhappy memories she left behind. `` They asked me if I wanted to play her as a 15-year-old,'' she says. `` That would be quite a stretch. It was flattering, but I thought better of it. What I really said was, ` Get real!''' Then it jumps ahead 15 years, as <PERSON> Maude </PERSON>, now a widow, returns to buy a run-down farm with a vow of turning it into a breeding stable for winning thoroughbreds. <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> is married to producer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, whose Indian Neck Productions has turned out such films as `` Hoosiers,'' `` From the Hip,'' `` Flight of the Navigator'' and `` The Witching Hour.'' `` We'll go up to our ranch and load up some pack horses and ride into the mountains for four or five days,'' she says. `` We'll pitch tents and live outdoors. I ride a buckskin cutting horse named Half a Buck. `` It's funny, but I did n't have much luck with horses when I was a kid. I had a bad experience of being thrown and kicked. I thought there was something about me that horses did n't like. `` On ` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s Angels' I had to jump out of a Jeep onto a horse and ride out of the camera frame. Thank goodness for the wrangler. The horse looked at me, laid his ears down and and went for the lowest branch. The wrangler went after me and pulled me off the horse. It was like a scene from a movie. He said, ` This horse is trying to kill you.''' Whatever it was, <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> got over it, learned to ride and has even been in a few races. This is the third miniseries for <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, who previously starred in `` A Death in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'' and `` Crossings.'' Last year she was in the TV movie `` Deadly Care'' as a nurse battling her addiction to drugs. Her next project may be an adaptation of a book she recently bought called `` Fulfillment,'' about a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farm family at the turn of the century. `` There's talk of making ` Bluegrass' into a series,'' she says, `` but I'm not very interested in doing another series at this point in my career.'' Nor is she interested in doing a `` Charlie's Angels'' reunion. `` All of us gagged at the prospect,'' she says. `` We did n't feel we could go home again. We've all moved on.'' <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> in the second year of the show. Other long-running angels were <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Producer <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON> is developing a new generation of `` Charlie's Angels'' for <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 The queen of off-Broadway has enlarged her kingdom this season. At an age when most people would have been retired for nearly 20 years, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> has gone uptown with two major Broadway productions _ `` Sarafina!'', an exuberant South African musical, and `` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' a drama about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet arms control negotiators. Not exactly commercial fluff, but then making money never was the reason Miss <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> got into producing more than 40 years ago in the backyard of her <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> home. `` If a work is theatrical and if it's something that moves me, then I will do it,'' she says. `` It is the theatricality of a play that appeals to me, not necessarily the subject matter.'' Miss <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON>, stylishly dressed in a black-and-white striped blouse and a black skirt, sits in the living room of her Fifth Avenue apartment. Her theater past is there, along with the present. An oil portrait of Miss <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> hangs above an elegant couch. The apartment is award heaven. A <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> stands on a table. There are proclamations, declarations, decrees and a parade of photographs in almost every room. There is a photograph of Miss Lortel with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON>, the two stars of `` A Walk in the Woods.'' The play by Broadway newcomer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON> focuses on the informal, one-on-one meetings of an American delegate and his Soviet counterpart to the nuclear disarmament talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The two men break diplomatic red tape by taking walks in the woods to discuss their countries' problems. `` Darling, I fell in love with ` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,' when I saw it at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> last year,'' she recalls. `` I felt that I had to do it. And it's important enough and good enough to do on Broadway.'' Miss <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> backs up her opinions with her money, some $ 850,000 plus to put `` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' a one set, two-character drama, on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` I tell you, it's a feeling I have, like when you seen a fine painting or something,'' she says. `` You ca n't explain it or why you feel emotional about it. This is the way I feel about plays.'' The money was left her by her husband, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, who made his fortune in the cigarette paper business. It was <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> who got her out of and then back into the theater. When they met during the Depression, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> was an aspiring actress. By then she had appeared on Broadway, portraying a slave girl in `` <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. `` I next played a virgin in ` The Virgin Man' and then a nymphomaniac in ` The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Gesture,''' she laughs. `` I had very long flowing hair in those days. `` In fact, a couple of those pictures on the piano might show what I looked like then,'' she says, gesturing to a provocative, almost modern photograph of a young, seductive-looking woman. `` I'm a little shocked at myself when I see them. <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> were married in March 1931 on the luxury liner Leviathan as the couple was returning from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The new wife continued to dabble in show business, but eventually gave up her career. `` You have to remember, it was 1931, honey, and his family was very strict,'' she recalls. `` He was n't, but his family was. In fact, my husband called me ` Volly,' meaning voluptuous.'' Sixteen years later, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> found herself back in show business, pretty much by accident. Friends were looking for a place to hold a reading of a new play, and she offered the old white barn on her 18-acre <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, estate. A new summer theater was born. `` In the beginning, it was n't so much that I picked the plays,'' she recalls. `` They picked me. Usually a director or a playwright came to me with something.'' At the White Barn Theater, she gave work to actors like <PERSON> Zero </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and life to experimental plays or new works by unknown authors. Over the years, as the White Barn's chief decision maker and financial backer, she has produced scores of works, including <PERSON> Athol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON>'s `` Blood Knot,'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Casey </PERSON>'s `` Red Roses for Me,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>'s `` Fam and Yam'' and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zindel </PERSON>'s `` The Effect of <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rays </ORGANIZATION> on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.'' As a 24th anniversary present, <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> bought his wife the Theater <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lys </PERSON>, a small, off-Broadway playhouse, in 1955. The first play she produced there _ a revival of the Weill-Brecht musical `` The Threepenny Opera'' _ ran for seven years. The show's long run stymied Miss <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON>'s producing instincts, so she took to presenting weekly matinee performances of new and old works at the de Lys while `` Threepenny'' was running at night. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> read <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. <PERSON> Siobhan </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> played <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenya </PERSON> recalled the life of <PERSON> Bertolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>. The Matinee Series lasted nearly 20 years before <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> decided it had run its course. All her work led her to be dubbed `` the Queen of off-Broadway'' by <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> theater critic <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>. The name stuck. <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> died in 1971 but his wife kept busy, looking after her off-Broadway property, renamed the <ORGANIZATION> Lucille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lortel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, running the White Barn, and co-producing several Broadway shows including `` Angels Fall'' and `` As Is.'' Today, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> keeps busy seeing new works and rarely is home during the evening. Often she's out five nights a week, looking at Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway and even showcase productions for new scripts. `` My life is the theater,'' she says. `` I did n't have any children, but the theater is my child. Since my husband died, I do n't know what I would have done without it. It's been my whole life. It's a wonderful place to go. You lose yourself in it, especially if it's good.''

<HEAD>New President Plans to Reorganize Haiti's Long-Dominant Army</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The 7,000-member military, long a dominant force in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, would be put to work building bridges and promoting public health under a reorganization plan drawn up by the nation's new leader. The plan, a key part of the 86-page platform of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION>, also would separate the police from the armed forces and put them under civilian control. `` There is a perception the army was ... corrupted by the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship,'' the party document says. `` But there is another truth, also incontestable, that the army was the victim of the Duvalier dictatorship, which humiliated, dismantled and decapitated it.'' `` There must be a ... rehabilitation to wipe out the image that the army is a repressive force against the civilian population.'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> as a candidate and now president has acted as a buffer between the army and its harshest critics. He claims he can control the institution that has dominated politics in this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> country of 6 million people from the time <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1804. Following the end of the 19-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation in 1934, the army put <PERSON> Dumarsais </PERSON> <PERSON> Estime </PERSON> in as president in 1946, took power itself in 1950 under Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magloire </PERSON>, and helped <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> win a disputed election that began a brutal 29-year dictatorship in 1957. <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> set up the <LOCATION> Tonton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macoutes </LOCATION> militia, which came to be generally regarded as street thugs, when the army and coast guard plotted against him. He emasculated <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s armed forces by shuffling, retiring and sometimes executing commanders. He based promotions on loyalty to him, and gave away state monopolies to his military favorites. When <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s son and successor, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> `` Baby Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, fled into exile in February 1986, a military-dominated junta led by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, then the army's chief of staff, took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s election Jan. 17 and inauguration Feb. 7. Opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the army will return to the barracks as <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, now the commander in chief, had pledged before the election, and whether <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> has the power to reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy. A Western diplomat who closely tracks political and military developments here said in an interview: `` All those who made officer between 1959 and 1971 were <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> appointees of very low quality. ... The officers who graduated in 1973 -LRB- two years after `` Baby Doc'' reopened the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ... see things differently. They're more progressive, they're more educated, they're more professional. `` But they're blocked by the system, they're blocked by the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> appointees above them _ the colonels, the generals _ who are not leaving,'' said the diplomat, speaking only on condition of anonymity. The military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to the smuggling of cars, rice, sugar and other goods. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> opened an office in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> in November because cocaine smuggling was rising so rapidly in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> informant, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, testified in federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in January that the trafficking was taking place under the protection of Haitian soldiers. Armed Forces of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> officials rarely respond to such criticism or charges. The military is a closed, secretive organization. All interviews have to be cleared with Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s successor as chief of staff. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> did not respond to a written request for an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The present-day army structure was established by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in 1916 to help put down a guerrilla-style insurrection. It is the main component of the armed forces, which also include the police, <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION>, fire department, a presidential guard and several other battalions and departmental commands. The armed forces' main role is to protect the president and maintain security _ a difficult task given their small numbers and inadequate equipment and training. The fire department is notoriously slow, and residents who have been robbed have to send their own cars to pick up police investigators. Military recruits, drawn from the lower middle class, are paid the equivalent of $ 160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to $ 1,800 for colonels and $ 3,400 for <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, the top commander. Enlistment terms run for six years and the military is considered a good career in a country where more than half the population can not find steady work and the annual per capita income is about $ 350. Training is limited, and equipment consists mostly of aging hand-me-downs from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ M-1 rifles and M-14 automatic weapons, a half-dozen helicopters of which only two or three work, a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters that patrol the coast. For 7,000 men, fewer than a single <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> division, there are five generals and 24 colonels. While <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> is the commander in chief, the 500-man battalion at the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> acts semi-autonomously under Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. The Dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incident last summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed anti-government demonstators. The green-uniformed, black-booted battalion, which patrols streets in this sprawling capital of 1 million, was noticeably absent Nov. 29, however, when gunmen with hand grenades and automatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced the cancellation of what would have been <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free, open and independently run presidential election in 30 years. `` It is the only unit that is really feared here,'' the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said, noting that some of the <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION>' Tonton Macoutes were incorporated into it. `` The men are very loyal to -LRB- Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB-. He ignores the chain of command and commands them directly.'' Nevertheless, the diplomat said he was optimistic that <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> might succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armed forces, and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule and participate in national development. `` The young officers aspire for change and they see it coming,'' the diplomat said. `` The problem remaining is the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>. We're waiting to see what <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> will do about that. `` In the next five years, we'll see a new generation of officers with diplomas who have traveled abroad, who are of a different mentality, who are young and cultured. They can give a new image to the army.'' A leading Haitian academic who has had a 30-year acquaintance with <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said he is not sure that will happen. Speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous, fearing recrimination, he said: `` The army wants to leave the civilian structures of power, not power itself. There's too much money to be made. `` Manigat is no puppet. Far from it. It is an extremely interesting battle. He makes the army believe he supports it. The army makes him believe they support him. Each one knows the other is lying. ... `` In the final analysis, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> is not capable of dominating the army or manipulating power. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s immediate future is going to be as tragic as its present and its past. I fear uprisings among the people.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> is a filmmaker who welcomes challenge. He took <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s sprawling paean to the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> astronauts, `` The Right Stuff,'' and made a highly original film that deserved better than it got at the box office. Now <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> undertakes an even more daunting assignment: filming <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundera </PERSON>'s novel of eroticism and politics in 1960s <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being.'' He has created a movie in the grand tradition of storytelling. It is intimate yet epic, a compelling human triangle played against the cataclysm of the 1968 Soviet invasion. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> -RRB- is a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> brain surgeon and a tireless womanizer. He merely commands `` take off your clothes,'' and women joyfully obey. <PERSON> Tereza </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Juliette </PERSON> <PERSON> Binoche </PERSON> -RRB-, a shy but firm-minded country girl, enters his life, and he agrees to marry her. But his philandering continues. <PERSON> Sabina </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> -RRB-, a free-spirited artist who fears commitment as much as <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON>, is content to remain his mistress. As tensions mount in the marriage, Soviet tanks roll into <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to quell the growing liberalization. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tereza </PERSON> flee to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. But unhappy with his duplicity, <PERSON> Tereza </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and he follows. Punished by the authorities for their defection, they settle on the farm where the story comes to an abrupt end. `` The Unbearable Lightness'' does not lend itself to condensation. There are too many complexities, too much probing of human motivations. The story requires careful telling, and <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> requires almost three hours. Only in the rustic setting does the pace falter. The film is illuminated by two extraordinary performances: by <PERSON> Juliette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brioche </PERSON>, whose <PERSON> Tereza </PERSON> marvelously traces a woman's emotional and intellectual growth; by <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON>, who manages to balance <PERSON> Sabina </PERSON>'s sensuality and her aestheticism The sequences in which they photograph each other in the nude is a masterful celebration of the female form. <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>, the amusing young snob of `` A Room With a View,'' is perfect within the confines of the hedonistic <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON>, his dark eyes smoldering with lust. But <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and co-writer <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrier </PERSON> never overcome the onesidedness of the character. <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaentz </PERSON>, whose other achievements include `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and `` Amadeus,'' produced with superior taste. All departments are commendable, especially <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Nykvist </PERSON>'s camera work and <PERSON> Leos </PERSON> <PERSON> Janacek </PERSON>'s music. The Orion release is rated R, with much female nudity and sexual activity. Running time: 171 minutes.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> recently won a Golden Globe for her television performance in `` The Two Mrs. <PERSON> Glenvilles </PERSON>,'' she experienced a warming wave of nostalgia. `` It was just 27 years ago thatthey -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- gave me the first award I ever received _ as the most promising newcomer of the year,'' she recalled. `` It was in the same room -LRB- International Ballroom, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> -RRB-, and I remember everything about it, including the dress I wore.'' In a town where most promising newcomers come and go like the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds, <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> is a phenomenon. After a quarter-century she continues high on any producer's casting list for sexually charged roles. At 46 she remains athletically curved, the emerald eyes smoldering, the voice throaty and inviting. She remains unchanged in other ways as well. The deep, full laugh erupts often, more in nervousness than mirth. She speaks in quiet, hesitant sentences, recalling the immigrant girl who seemed bewildered when <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> proclaimed her sexuality in such films as `` Kitten With a Whip'' and `` The Pleasure Seekers.'' <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, her husband-manager for 20 years, live in the hilltop house overlooking <LOCATION> Benedict </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>; it had been the honeymoon home of <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>. The other day in the sunny living room where <PERSON> Bogie </PERSON> once held court, the actress reminisced about her <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> career and talked about two forthcoming films: `` A Tiger's Tale,'' with <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON>; and `` A New Life,'' with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>. In `` A Tiger's Tale'' she plays a character named is Rose Butts. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON> <PERSON> Drumm </PERSON>. `` It takes place in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, as you might guess,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON> is one of my daughter's boyfriends, and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> tries very hard to get away from him. But he is so dear and so adorable, and he really wants to see her. They go out a couple of times as friends. `` But he is so insistent, she realizes he really loves her. And she realizes she loves him. He's very sweet, and quite innocent.'' In `` A New Life'' she and <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> play a couple who have been married 26 years. They have a 24-year-old daughter. `` In the very first scene we're in the divorce lawyer's office, and he's saying ` Why are you doing this?' `` He's a workaholic,'' <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> said. `` He loves her very much, but he works five days a week and plays golf with clients on Saturday and tennis on Sunday. The rest of the film concerns all the people he dates and all the people I date. There are some very odd characters out there.'' She was born <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ollson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Valsjobyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, in 1941, and accompanied her parents to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the age of 5. Her talent developed early, and at 16, she appeared on <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s Amateur Hour on television After a year at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, she left to tour with other students who formed a music group called the Suttletones. After a few bookings, the group broke up and <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> looked for work in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` I auditioned for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> at his office at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> studio 28 years ago,'' she recalled. `` He still has his office there. `` We found a piano on one of the stages. We took the tarp off, and my pianist played for me. I did a couple of songs, and Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> asked me if I would be in his show.'' She appeared with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' pal <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> put her on his television show. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> to play <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' daughter in `` A Pocketful of Miracles,'' and <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> cast her in the remake, with <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> music, of `` State Fair.'' But it was `` Bye, Bye, Birdie'' with <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> that established her as a hot new star. <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> supplied her special brand of sex appeal to such leading men as <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Cincinnati Kid'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> -LRB- `` Murderer's Row'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> -LRB- `` R.P.M.'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Delon </PERSON> -LRB- `` Once a Thief'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> -LRB- `` Viva Las Vegas'' -RRB-. Not until <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' `` Carnal Knowledge'' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- did <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> achkowledge that she could act. She won an Academy Award nomination as supporting actress, a feat she repeated with `` Tommy'' in 1975. In 1967, she married <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the handsome blond star of the `` 77 Sunset Strip'' TV series of the'50s. He abandoned his own acting career to become her personal manager, guiding her not only for films but in her dynamic night club act. Backstage at a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> casino in 1972, she fell 22 feet from a platform to the stage, suffering a broken arm, five facial fractures and a brain concussion. Within 10 weeks she was ready to star again her Las Vegas act. The personal appearances ended abruptly in 1983 when <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was stricken with myasthenia gravis, a disease of the nerves that weakens muscles. `` For a long time <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> had no strength, could n't even make a fist,'' she said. `` Happily, he has been in remission for two years now. He works out every day in our gym for an hour and a half. He skis and rides a bike. He's in good shape.'' <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> works out daily, too, and she may one day return to the act. It all depends on <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>: `` It's very simple: he's first.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Major Degas Retrospective Opens in Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time in more than 50 years, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is celebrating the unparalleled genius of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>, the 19th century artist whose graceful ballerinas and busy race track scenes have long been synonymous with impressionism. More than 300 paintings, drawings, monotypes, pastels, watercolors, photographs and sculpture by the man who once said he wanted to die `` illustrious and unknown'' are on show at the Grand Palais until May 16. Critics say <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> got his wish. In his lifetime, he was famous for the sweet-faced ballet dancers in crinoline tutus he portrayed on stage under the lights, in rehearsal, at rest and exercising at the barre. At odd angles and sometimes off center, the `` dancers'' were experiments in perspective and composition that differentiated <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> from his impressionist contemporaries. In 1912, five years before his death, `` Danseuses a la Barre'' -LRB- `` Dancers at the Barre'' -RRB- sold for 430,000 francs _ then one of the highest prices on record. But <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> did not consider himself the painter of ballerinas. For him, they were just `` a pretext for painting pretty fabric and capturing movement.'' Funded by a $ 1.5 million grant from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the exhibition will travel to the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from June 16 to Aug. 28 and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from Sept. 27 to Jan. 8, 1989. More comprehensive than previous <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> shows, this one features little known works rarely seen in public and which reveal an artist who was misogynist, anti-Semitic and voyeuristic, someone critics said liked to `` peep through keyholes.'' One of <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' favorite subjects was women at their toilette and he painted them tirelessly throughout a 60-year-career. Bathing in the tub, stepping into the tub or climbing out, draped over the tub or sitting on its edge, washing, drying and combing their hair, <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' nudes were ongoing experiments in form and color, perspective and technique. Early in his career, he used oils almost exclusively. But at the age of 36, his vision began to decline and he turned to pastels, watercolors and later charcoal. By 1912, he was completely blind. `` Until now, nudes had always adopted studied poses,'' <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> said in 1886, after the last impressionist show. `` My women are simple people, concerned only with what they're doing. Here's one washing her feet. It's as though you were looking through the keyhole.'' There were other simple folk in Degas' paintings: thick-waisted and perspiring laundresses; jockeys on horseback; cafe singers belting out the latest tunes; hat makers with swollen, pinpricked fingers; and naked prostitutes, shown in the picture `` Party for the Boss.'' But there were also numerous renditions of <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' stuffy, middle-class milieu. The son of a banker, he painted the stiff portraits of bored looking gentlemen in dark suits and their buttoned-up wives. <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> was a notorious anti-Semite who broke with many of his closest friends, including <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisarro </PERSON> and the wealthy <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON> family, during the Dreyfus affair. A firm believer in the guilt of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, the Jewish captain convicted of treason, he once kicked out of his studio a woman model who casually mentioned the possibility of <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION>' innocence. `` Le General Mellinet et le Grand Rabbin Astruc'' -LRB- `` General <PERSON> Mellinet </PERSON> and Rabbi Astruc'' -RRB-, a small format portrait, also caused controversy because of the unflattering way in which <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> transformed <PERSON> Astruc </PERSON>'s fine features. `` Degas, blinded by <PERSON> Judeophobia </PERSON>, sacked his divine model, replaced a miniature mouth by fat sensual lips,'' <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Astruc </PERSON>, the rabbi's brother, said at the time. `` This painting is not a work of art,'' <PERSON> Astruc </PERSON> said. `` It's a pogrom.'' One of the most striking early masterpieces on show is `` Portrait de Famille,'' also known as `` La <ORGANIZATION> Famille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bellelli </ORGANIZATION>'' -LRB- `` The Bellelli Family'' -RRB- -LRB- 1858-67 -RRB-. Though the subject was family members he supposedly liked, critics have long wondered at the painting's surpising absence of warmth and affection. Another early painting unlike any of his later works is `` Interior or the Rape'' -LRB- 1868-69 -RRB-, showing a bedroom scene between a young woman with bare shoulders kneeling on the floor, her back to a tall, bearded man watching her intently. The show catalog refers to the work as one of <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' `` most mysterious ... highlighting the difficulty the artist had with women.'' As <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manet </PERSON> put it in a letter to <PERSON> Berthe </PERSON> <PERSON> Morisot </PERSON>, `` He is n't natural. He is incapable of loving a woman. He ca n't even tell her. He ca n't do anything.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Springfield </PERSON> considers himself a searcher, a learner. And three years ago, he discovered that he needed some time away from the music business. After a series of hit albums, a featured role in the hit TV soap, `` General Hospital,'' and a feature movie, `` Hard to Hold,'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> had had enough. `` I had nothing to say,'' he recalled. `` There was no one moment. It was a process. I was walking around my house _ this beautiful ranch in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. I was thinking about how unhappy I was.'' On his new LP, `` Rock of Life,'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> sings about the pressures of fame, why he had to quit, why he is back. `` I was caught with my guard down when the world came knocking,'' he sings on the title track _ the album's first single. `` There's pain and confusion and I'm trying to understand.'' On `` World Start Turning,'' he sings: `` Just another soul lost in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I was so frustrated.'' One of the problems with fame, he said, was that being the idol of millions of female fans created tension with his then-girlfriend, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, who is now his wife. `` We had a lot of problems. I denied her for a while. People would ask me if I had a girlfriend and I'd say ` no.' She had trouble handling me.'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>'s first hit single was `` Speak to the Sky,'' a Top 15 hit in 1972 and No. 1 in his native <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He also released the albums `` Comic Book Heroes'' and `` Wait for Night.'' When his music career cooled, he took up acting, making appearances on `` The Six Million Dollar Man,'' `` The Rockford Files'' and `` The Incredible Hulk.'' But it was his role as Dr. <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> in `` General Hospital'' that set <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>'s career soaring. In the early 1980s, he released the platinum-selling albums `` Working Class Dog'' and `` Success Has n't Spoiled Me Yet.'' `` <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON>'s Girl,'' a single from `` Working Class Dog'' reached No. 1 on the charts and earned him a Grammy Award in 1981. `` Success Has n't Spoiled Me Yet'' yielded another major hit single, `` Do n't Talk to Strangers,'' which earned a Grammy nomination for best male pop vocalist But after the hit LP `` Living in Oz,'' and 1985's `` TAO,'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> took time off to be with his wife and their newly-born son, <PERSON> Liam </PERSON>. Becoming a parent was a major turning point in his life. `` I accepted the responsibility,'' he said. `` I realized I had to be strong enough for both of us.'' Raising a child also made him think about his father, who had died a few years before <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> was born. On `` Tear It All Down,'' the rocker that leads off Side 2 of `` Rock of Life,'' he sings: `` I look at my innocent boy as he sleeps. ... I wish there was some way I could talk to my father again.'' `` I felt I needed to talk to him,'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> said. `` Seeing myself with <PERSON> Liam </PERSON>, I saw a lot of him in me.'' Despite the hiatus, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> was able to record the new album in only nine weeks. `` I was very definite about I wanted. I do extensive demos,'' he said. He also credits producer <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, who worked on `` <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON>'s Girl'' and another hit single, `` I've Done Everything for You,'' with giving him the sound he wanted `` When I finished the demos, I realized there would be a lot of vocals,'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> said. `` Keith is real, real good with vocals. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> has the ability to create a warm sound.'' While most of the album is about the downside of fame, the two final songs are upbeat: `` Hold On to Your Dream'' and `` -LRB- If You Think You're -RRB- Groovy.'' `` Hold On to Your Dream'' is about losing hope, then regaining it. `` Do n't tell me it's over, I still smell the fire,'' <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> sings. `` Groovy'' is the album's only remake. Written in the late'60s by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of the English rock group, The <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faces </ORGANIZATION>, `` Groovy'' is a personal favorite of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>'s and a song that almost did not get put on the album. `` I had to fight a couple of battles but I had good reasons for putting it on the record: A _ It had a different slant. B _ It's a part of my life, an important part of my life,'' he said. With the album completed and a worldwide tour anticipated, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> is hopeful about maintaining his popularity. `` I think I've taken my audience along with me,'' he said. `` I do n't think I'm going to lose fans because I'm married. I think the young crowd is in a position to appreciate what's being said.'' Regardless of how successful his comeback is, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> wants to continue to grow as a person. `` I'd like to have the time to grow as a writer and learn what I need to learn,'' he said. `` Discovering yourself is instrumental.''

 <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> could be easy to hate: He's a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a budding literary star and he even has what used to be called matinee idol good looks. At age 27, he has seen his short stories collected in a critically acclaimed new book, `` The Emperor of the Air'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 15.95 -RRB-. <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> has enough charm to deflect resentment. He is modest and self-deprecating, almost worried about his near overnight success. And at a time when trendy young writers such as <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tama </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> are regularly bashed by literary critics, <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> is different enough to resist comparison. `` We're different kinds of writers,'' said <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> during a recent interview at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bookstore </ORGANIZATION> cafe. `` I do n't want to be movie-star famous. I want to move people with my writing ... because I'm so moved myself by -LRB- good -RRB- writing. But it's really easy to get swept up by the American publicity machine.'' Every story <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> has written since age 19 has been published. And his stories bear little resemblance to the world of the neo-hip New Yorkers chronicled by the new breed of writers. There are no tales of bohemian artists in <LOCATION> SoHo </LOCATION>, no cocaine-snorting yuppies, no alienated college students. Instead, <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> writes simple and spare stories in the voices of the elderly and middle-aged as well as the young. They are about people on the verge of change, people confronted with decision and possible crisis. They are people not unlike <PERSON> Canin </PERSON>: facing a new and scary experience. <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> will tell you that most of the varied characters in his stories `` are me.'' His tales also hint at the dark side of life: the inevitability and quiet anguish of aging; the shadow of infidelity over a long marriage; the emotional violence that often lurks within families. But they end just short of despair. His characters have hope, however jaded. The old man in `` We Are Nighttime Travelers'' has been married to his wife for years. The two have grown so far apart that they live isolated, secret lives, separated by inches of bedsheet every night that might as well be miles. Though he feels himself dying a little bit more each day, surrounded by pills, poor circulation and a faltering memory, the old man is suddenly seized by a sense of renewal in the midst of decay. He takes his wife on a romantic walk in middle of a cold night. Later, he kisses her for the first time in ages and has `` the feeling of a miracle.'' <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> is a fourth-year medical student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and said that some of his insight into the elderly came from the older people he has examined. `` You meet 40 people a day and you talk to them about their lives,'' he said. `` A lot of them are older. If someone comes in under 55 you're so grateful to see young flesh.'' Medicine keeps him in contact with people. He has balanced a love and aptitude for science with writing since he started at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>. He began as a physics major and took a creative writing class for an easy grade. His teacher sent one of the stories he wrote in class -LRB- included as `` Lies'' in his book -RRB- to a literary quarterly in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> and it was accepted. `` It's still the biggest thrill I've ever received,'' he said. He switched to an English major at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> and then earned a master's degree in fine arts from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Writer's Workshop. He only wrote two stories in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and said it's a competitive place `` where I think some people really clam up.'' As a result, <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> applied to medical school after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and was accepted at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. He wrote most of his stories in medical school, many when he had to study for exams. `` It was a kind of mini-rebellion,'' he said. But once again, <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> is postponing science. Though he has only several months left of medical school, he is planning to take at least a year or two off. He leaves for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on April 1 and hopes to write a novel there. <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> freely admits to a charmed life. But he is equally candid about the peculiar fears that accompany a lifetime of good fortune. `` My life has been very good,'' he said. `` If it were to turn bad, maybe I'd be the first person to go out and stab someone.'' That ominous sentiment echoes <PERSON> Canin </PERSON>'s favorite story in his collection, `` American Beauty'' in which a boy waits all summer to hear worldly wisdom dispensed by a troubled older brother leaving home. `` If something ever goes wrong, you're going to turn into a son of a bitch, just like me,'' the brother tells him. `` Just like every guy in the world. You do n't know it yet because everything's all right so far You think you're a nice guy and everything has n't really affected you But you ca n't get away from it. It's in your blood.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Brenda Lee Eyes Broadway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For timeless torch singer <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the dilemma is not what to sing but what to leave out. With a career spanning more than 30 years, she finds it impossible to sing all her hit records during one concert. `` I do three medleys and still have to leave out a bunch,'' the irrepressible 43-year-old performer says. `` I'd be up there three hours if I sang them all.'' Her tender, bluesy voice on such songs as `` I'm Sorry'' and `` All Alone Am I'' has carried her to record sales of about 100 million. `` It feels pretty good,'' she says. `` It's kind of unbelievable in a way. But it feels great.'' After 12 million-selling single records and performances in 52 foreign nations, she embarks on another career milestone this year. She's set to begin appearing in a musical called `` Music! Music! Music!'' at <LOCATION> Opryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. It's a preliminary step to what she hopes might be performing on Broadway. Earlier in her career, she did summer stock in `` The Wizard of Oz'' and `` Bye, <PERSON> Bye </PERSON> <PERSON> Birdie </PERSON>.'' `` It's always been in the back of my mind,'' she says about the yearning for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage. `` But I do n't know if it ever will come about.'' The <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> production will pose a new challenge for the entertainer who earned $ 35 for her first performance in 1955 and eventually grew to such stature that she sang for the queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` It will give me a chance to do some different things,'' she says. `` I thought I'd fit into it well. It will give me a chance to spread my wings a little.'' Miss <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> will be seen this spring on a special musical production called `` Shake, Rattle and Roll'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. She recently appeared in a similar show, `` Legendary Ladies,'' on cable TV's <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON>. Her rollicking `` Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree'' just enjoyed another holiday season and now has sold more than 6 million copies. `` It feels a little strange when I sing it in July, but that's all right,'' she said Only her `` I'm Sorry'' has more sales, 10 million. She professes to having no favorite hit, but says, `` ` I'm Sorry' has a special place because I believed in it so long before I recorded it But I liked all of the songs. `` It bothers me to leave them out -LRB- in concert -RRB- because the people want to hear certain ones. If they yell out a request, I stop and do it and let the show go longer if I can.'' Her other hits include `` Comin' on Strong,'' `` Sweet Nothin's,'' `` As Usual,'' `` Fool Number One'' and `` Too Many Rivers.'' Her `` Break It to Me Gently'' preceded a hit version by <LOCATION> Juice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. Similarly, she had a hit with `` Always on My Mind'' before <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> recorded it. She offers these comments on current female pop stars: <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> _ `` I like her. She's got a different style and a flair and she's her own person. She's courageous in what she does.'' <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> _ `` She's a very classy lady and a very good singer with roots in gospel music that show through. She's bringing back ballads and I'm glad she's around to do that.'' <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> _ `` She reminds me of me as far as her energy and singing. I was n't as wild or as way out as she may be but she's very energetic and unorthodox and I was that way She does n't just stand there and sing and be pretty. She jumps around and moves and sweats and gets close to the audience. I like that.'' Miss <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who made her 19th tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in December, says her love of performing has not dwindled since she was dubbed `` Little Miss Dynamite'' as a teen-age entertainer nearly a quarter century ago. `` Keeping up your zest for singing is not hard. It's everything else _ getting there and the travel _ all the stuff that goes into it. Singing is definitely the easy part,'' she says. `` I want to keep doing it because I love the business and I know how to do it. I've lasted because of the people who've bought the records and supported me and because of the DJ's who've played my records. `` I've had so many thrills it would be hard to pick the top one,'' she says. `` When you sing for heads of state and queens, have gold records and win awards, it's so hard to say one was the most exciting. `` One of them was meeting -LRB- gospel great -RRB- <PERSON> Mahalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. She was one of my idols along with <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 `` You Can Dance'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> It's got a good beat and you can dance to it. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s new album is n't really new, but rather a collection of danceable hits, remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking the artists' work, track by track, and reconstructing it. Most such remixes become 12-inch dance singles, and `` You Can Dance,'' is basically a compilation of these. The album includes `` Everybody,'' <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s first single, remixed into a long dance version, and the 12-inch disco mixes of `` Holiday,'' `` Into the Groove,'' `` Over and Over,'' `` Physical Attraction'' and `` Where's the Party?'' The only new cut is `` Spotlight.'' All are vintage <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> _ light, unburdened, often hypnotically rhythmic pop music that you can, indeed, dance to, and sometimes even listen to. `` Into the Groove'' may be recognized by film buffs since it got additional notice in <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s film debut, the 1985 `` Desperately Seeking <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>.'' Her film career has n't prospered since then, but her recording career has not flagged. `` Where's the Party?'' is from her most recent album `` True Blue,'' released last year. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> got her start in dance clubs, and `` You Can Dance'' is an obvious tribute to the disco milieu, where stamina and dependability are more valuable than intellect any day. It might just be the only dance record you'll ever need _ if you need only a beat, not necessarily heart, to get moving.

<HEAD>IBM Announces New Mainframes, Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday announced a new design and new internal software for its largest computers, continuing a chain of enhancements dating back to the first System-360 in 1964. The world's dominant maker of mainframe computers, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> controls about 70 percent of the market. The huge computers are used by the government and almost all major businesses. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the improvements would allow computers to obtain access to information more rapidly and allow users to develop new programs for their own needs more easily. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also unveiled new models of its biggest line of mainframe computers, the 3090 series, and of its slightly smaller 4381 series. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the new architecture _ a way of putting computers and data storage devices together _ would permit more productive use of existing computers. The computer giant said the new operating system, which governs the internal workings of a computer, was a major new development comparable to the advent of the System-360 in 1964, the System-370 in 1970, and the 370-Extended Architecture of 1981. The Enterprise Systems Architecture-370, the new operating system, can be used in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s 3090 and 4381 mainframe computers. The ESA-370, which controls the division of room in a computer data storage device, allows computers to reach 16 trillion characters of data that are held in `` virtual storage.'' That is 8,000 times greater than the virtual storage accessible with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s current operating system Information held in virtual storage can be retrieved almost as quickly as information held in the computer's main memory. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also announced a program for helping computers get at stored information more rapidly. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the program, called Data Facility Storage Management, is the most `` significant storage advancement in 20 years.'' It also announced a piece of hardware that allows the 3090 to run as if it were four different computers in one. `` These new products have important benefits to our customers now, and help them plan for the future by setting a path for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> large system growth into the next decade,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucente </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> vice president and group executive in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing and services group. `` They establish a new foundation for future enhancements that will continue to help our customers take advantage of these new capabilities,'' he said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the 3090 models 280E and 500E would cost $ 4.9 million and $ 9.65 million, respectively. The 280E will be available in the second quarter of the year, while the 500E will be available in the third quarter. The 4381 models 91E is priced at $ 550,000, and the 92E is priced at $ 920,000. Both will be available in November.

 The number of oil and gas rigs working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped by 18 this week to total 968, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> announced. This week's total reflects the number of rigs working as of last Friday. A year ago, the count 806, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Monday. The previous week, the rig count had recovered from recent losses by posting an increase of 22 to total 986. The rig count usually declines during the first few months of the year. Houston-based <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, and not rigs producing oil. The rig count is a widely-watched industry index of drilling activity. <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which merged this year with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the count reached a peak with 4,500 active rigs. But in the summer of 1986, the rig count fell to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures _ as oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel. Among the major oil producing states, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> each gained five rigs this week. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> posted the largest decreases, losing 10 and seven respectively. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> each lost five rigs, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> each lost three. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s count was down by two.

<HEAD>Societe Generale Shares Soar As De Benedetti Launches Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Shares of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> soared Monday as Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> launched his long-awaited bid to take control of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company. But dealers noted that <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, which surged 580 francs to 4,730 francs, or about $ 135.14 each, remained well above the 4,000 francs a share <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay. Dealers predicted <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> would wait for the price to fall before increasing his stake. His current offer runs through March 4. The Italian investor claims to be the largest single shareholder, controlling through allies about 38 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. He is seeking to acquire an additional 15 percent stake in the company. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s shares traded at a record 4,850 francs a share last Thursday. But the shares plunged 700 francs each on Friday, when a group of mostly Belgian investors failed to agree with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> to keep <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> anchored in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Failure to reach an agreement forced Belgian industrialist <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.V. </ORGANIZATION> holding company, to quit as the group's spokesman, strengthening <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s hand. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> is seeking to run the day-to-day operation of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which controls a third of the Belgian economy, and turn the company into a pan-European holding enterprise. The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said it controlled 28 percent of the company's outstanding shares, while <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> claimed 15 percent. But together with various small allies, <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said the bloc would have been assured of absolute majority at shareholders meetings. Rumors surfaced as to a possible replacement for <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>, but no one has yet been named. Economic Affairs Minister <PERSON> Phillipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maystadt </PERSON> said over the weekend that `` vital sectors'' of the economy that are controlled by <PERSON> Societe </PERSON> <PERSON> Generale </PERSON> would still be subject to a government veto, whoever holds a majority stake in the company. `` Above and beyond all the financial games, we must return to the essential point for <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, which is that certain strategic sectors remain under Belgian control,'' <PERSON> Maystadt </PERSON> said. In recent weeks, trading of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> shares off the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> stock exchange often outweighed official trading, with anonymous buyers paying premium rates for the company's shares. Last Thursday, the unofficial share price rose as high as 5,300 francs. Traders said they could not tell Monday who bought <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> shares.

 <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday it raised its offer for rival insurer <ORGANIZATION> Assubel-Vie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> by 20 percent to 7,200 francs, or about $ 205.71 per share. <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> announced the new bid, its second for Assubel-Vie, to offset a counter-offer for <PERSON> Assubel-Vie </PERSON>'s stock by a group of investors backed by <PERSON> Assubel-Vie </PERSON>. The new bid, which values Assubel-Vie at almost 9 billion francs, or about $ 257 million, will be launched Tuesday and run through the end of the month, <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The offer is for all of <ORGANIZATION> Assubel-Vie </ORGANIZATION>'s 1.24 million shares, <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> said. Assubel Vie is not quoted on the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> stock exchange. The sweetened offer is considerably higher than required under Belgian takeover regulations, which requires offers to increase by 5 percent. A <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> official said the company made a higher offer `` to avoid a bidding war.'' However, <PERSON> Assubel-Vie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s third largest insurer, indicated it would continue to resist <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, even though the group supported by <PERSON> Assubel-Vie </PERSON> is offering 6,000 francs, or $ 171 per share. The group includes <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruxelles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s second largest holding company; <ORGANIZATION> Assurances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, a state-owned French insurer; <ORGANIZATION> Cobepa </ORGANIZATION>, a Belgian holding company, and <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosane </ORGANIZATION>. Assubel-Vie called in the four companies after <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s banking commission ruled last month the company had to come up with alternative shareholders if it wanted to block <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>'s bid. The group's counter-offer for <PERSON> Assubel-Vie </PERSON> was launched a week ago and expires on Friday.

 Domestic car and truck sales, boosted by aggressive buyer incentive programs, rose 2.8 percent in early February over the same period a year ago, automakers reported Monday. `` Sales are very strong. We have n't seen a major downturn in the market yet, although many were expecting one,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>, an industry analyst with <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Car makers sold 192,001 domestically built cars and 102,754 domestically built light trucks in the nine selling days from Feb. 1-10, up from 170,134 cars and 84,734 trucks in eight days in the same period a year ago. Sales are compared on the basis of average daily sales during a period rather than on straight totals. While car sales rose only 0.3 percent from early February 1987, truck sales climbed 7.8 percent. On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars were selling at an annual rate of 8.4 million vehicles, indicating dealers were doing a brisk business in early February. `` The market will probably subside in mid-February,'' but a major sales dive is n't likely, <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. Among the Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales fell 4.2 percent against early February 1987, but sales of domestically built <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> trucks rose 4.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of both markets shrank, however. Industry-leader <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> held 50.9 percent of the domestic car market, down from 53.3 percent a year ago, and 40.7 percent of the truck market, down from 41.9 percent a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest automaker, sold 5.9 percent more domestic cars than a year ago and 3.7 percent more trucks. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the car market grew to 28.8 percent from 27.3 percent a year ago, but its domestic truck share fell to 35.5 percent from 36.9 percent a year ago. No. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of domestically built cars jumped 12.8 percent, and its share of that market increased to 14.9 percent from 13.3 percent a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic truck sales rose 24.6 percent in early February while its market share grew to 22.1 percent from 19.2 percent a year ago. <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, suffering from large inventories, cut production and offered the most aggressive buyer incentives in the market. American <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 4 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, suffered a 15 percent drop in sales from early February 1987, and its share of the market shrank to 3.8 percent from 4.4 percent a year ago. But <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s lost sales on short supply of its popular cars. `` Demand outstripped production,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has only a 10 - to 12-day supply of domestic cars, compared with an industry norm of 60-65 days supply <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car sales tumbled 45.5 percent in early February and its domestic truck sales fell 10.7 percent, making it the only domestic maker whose truck sales declined. `` <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s been having problems all year. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> has been the least tolerant of yen-induced price increases. Even though the cars are American-built, much of the componentry is brought from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s U.S.-build Sentra subcompact sedan and coupe have suffered from increased competition in the small-car segment of the market, he noted.

 A new superconductor that operates at higher temperatures and may be easier to adapt to practical applications has been discovered by a research team in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, scientists said Monday. The superconductor is not merely a refinement of either of the two known high-temperature superconductors, but an entirely new compound that in some respects may exceed the performance of the others, said a panel of scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The new material _ a mixture of bismuth, strontium, calcium, copper and oxygen _ raises the temperature at which superconductivity occurs to about 243 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, a jump of more than 50 degrees above levels attained with previous superconductors. Scattered reports have appeared during the past year of superconductivity occurring at room temperature or even higher temperatures, but those observations have not been confirmed and are not widely accepted. In contrast, the properties of the new material were confirmed within days after its discovery was disclosed on Jan. 22 in a newspaper in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the researchers said. `` I personally am quite happy we have found a third one,'' said <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. He won a Nobel Prize last fall for his discovery in January 1986 of the first of the new high-temperature superconductors. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s superconductor was made of lanthanum, strontium, copper and oxygen. Superconductors carry electricity with no resistance and therefore no wasteful dissipation of electricity. Before <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s discovery, superconductivity occurred only at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero, about 459 degrees below zero Fahrenheit Comparatively expensive liquid helium was required to cool them to the temperatures at which they became superconducting. A year after <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s discovery, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> and others discovered a second superconducting compound made of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen that became a superconductor above the temperature of liquid nitrogen, 321 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. That was important because liquid nitrogen is relatively inexpensive and widely available. Later in the year, researchers demonstrated that the second compound could carry significant amounts of electrical current, an important requirement for practical application of superconductors. Last month, a Japanese team led by <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> discovered the new bismuth superconductor. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> did not attend Monday's meeting. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> noted that for the third consecutive year a new superconductor has been discovered in January. `` One may have hopes we'll have another in a year,'' he said. The new superconductor appears to be flexible, suggesting that it might lend itself more easily than the others to the fabrication of wire, said <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON>, a chemist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Because the superconductor operates at significantly higher temperatures, its electrical properties at the temperature of liquid nitrogen may be superior to the properties of the other superconductors, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. As a general rule, the properties of superconductors improve the farther you go below the so-called transition temperature at which they become superconducting, he explained Critical properties in addition to the transition temperature are the maximum current the superconductor can accommodate and the maximum magnetic field it can withstand, <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON> said. Another potential advantage of the new material is that bismuth is more stable than barium, which means that the new superconductor might be less likely to break down chemically over a period of time, said <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON>. Although the researchers were optimistic that the new compound would have useful properties, they said not enough time had yet elapsed for those properties to be measured. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a professor of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said the availability of a third superconductor will make it easier for researchers to develop theories explaining how high-temperature superconductors work. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he believes the new superconductors are profoundly different from conventional superconductors. `` What we've discovered is not just a new kind of superconductor,'' he said, `` but a new kind of metal.''

 The past year was a good one for the beef cattle industry, and 1988 will bring renewed efforts to export its products, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. From a cattleman's viewpoint, beef prices `` are going to be very good,'' <ORGANIZATION> NCA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> told reporters at the association's annual convention Aggressive promotional campaigns and stronger demand will reduce the amount of beef in the market, resulting in better prices, <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said. Because of health concerns, the industry has in past years experienced overproduction and lower sales, with American consumers buying more poultry, pork and other products. Some experts say there is little evidence to suggest a strengthening in demand for meat products in domestic markets. The <ORGANIZATION> NCA </ORGANIZATION> is working hard in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and with foreign governments to lower or eliminate tariffs and embargoes on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> beef, <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said. `` We must promote and advertise beef to improve demand, but that will do us little good if we are legislated or regulated out of business,'' he said in a report to nearly 5,000 cattlemen and family members attending the convention and trade show in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Middaugh </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said a 21 percent increase in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s beef quota last year, plus projected increases through the end of the century, demonstrate the benefits of developing foreign markets. The Japanese government responded to high consumer demand by hiking the import quota in August by 37,000 metric tons, <PERSON> Middaugh </PERSON> said. In the first 11 months of 1987, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> beef and veal exports worldwide totaled 192,731 metric tons valued at $ 703.8 million. This was a 22 percent increase in tonnage and a 26 percent increase in dollar value over the previous year, <PERSON> Middaugh </PERSON> said. Of the 1987 totals, 116,668 metric tons or $ 511.5 million went to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. That represented a 13 percent increase in tonnage and 17 percent increase in dollar value over the previous year. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NCA </ORGANIZATION> `` strongly supports the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- government's position to abolish quotas But other changes need to be made in the distribution of beef in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>... We know that the Japanese have a great liking for beef.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s consumer price index rose by 1.6 percent in January, slightly higher than predicted, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. In December, the inflation rate stood at 1.3 percent, and for all of 1987 it reached 16.1 percent, the lowest in 15 years. Finance Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> called on employers, unions and workers to show restraint in wage negotiations in order to slow down inflation. `` The index is relatively high, and we have to work for a lower figure,'' <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is no doubt that if want to reach a desirable level, a European level, it does n't work at once.'' The price increase was largely fueled by rising prices for fruits and vegetables. The consumer price index measures the change in retail prices for a basket of goods and services. In 1985, the government launched a sweeping austerity program to curb triple-digit inflation and reduce a $ 750 million budget deficit. The reforms helped reduce inflation from a record 444.9 percent in 1984 to 19.7 percent in 1986.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it will submit a sweetened cash bid for <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` in excess of $ 65 a share'' on Tuesday, when the retail giant's board is set to meet to review takeover offers. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in a statement Monday that while its board may act on the bids at the meeting, `` there can be no assurance that any definitive transaction will take place.'' A $ 65-a-share bid would value the retail giant at about $ 5.75 billion. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, which confirmed it has been negotiating with numerous parties, has twice spurned <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s initial $ 47-per-share, $ 4.2 billion takeover offer as inadequate and turned down an improved $ 61-per-share, $ 5.4 billion bid because it was not convinced <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had the necessary financing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said it was notified of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions in a letter over the weekend. A <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will make an offer to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board to `` enter into a definitive agreement providing for a price per share in excess of $ 65 in cash.'' While <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> did acknowledge it had held talks with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, it did not identify other parties it has negotiated with. Among those believed to be interested in Federated is the leveraged buyout firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Last week, in a letter to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> warned that any agreement between <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> would be met with `` a vigorous legal challenge. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said the negotiations involve the possible restructuring of the Cincinnati-based retailer, which operates about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales exceeding $ 11 billion in 1987. `` The purpose of these negotiations is to be able to present to the company's board of directors ... several alternatives for the board's consideration. Each of the parties has been urged to make its best proposal, because the board may take definitive action at that time,'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in its statement Monday. The company also said the board will consider `` the risks inherent in any such transaction, the financial capability of the purchaser, and the extent to which any purchaser may have taken action to discourage others from submitting proposals to the company.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman retorted that `` possible action to discourage others'' was `` a veiled reference to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s letter to <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>, and if that is the case, we believe our letter is totally justifiable.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> revealed in a Feb. 5 <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing that it was considering alternatives including selling assets, restructuring, or an outright sale of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based development company, bought <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sold several Allied divisions but retained retailing chains including <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s holdings include the New York-based chains of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Bullocks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> politicians are worried that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will buy <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, sell off major portions of the company and fire or lay off large numbers of its employees. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, D-Ohio and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust subcommittee, said last week he is concerned that a <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> purchase of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> could reduce retail competition in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> both own stores.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders have agreed to iron out differences between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of a trade bill and send it to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for passage by April 1, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters after meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive council that he won an agreement last week with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and all the leaders of the legislation to wrap up a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference on a compromise version by March 23 `` No question in my mind, we'll pass a trade bill ... with enough votes to override a veto, should that be necessary,'' he said. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said last month that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto either version as they stand now as being too protectionist. Both were passed early last year, but efforts to reach a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise to be sent to the White House were abandoned after the October stock market crash. Basically, each would require countries with free access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets to provide that same type of open access to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods in their markets. If a country does not remove its tariffs or quotas on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods, the president would be required to impose the same measures on their exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he also met last week with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trade representative, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, expressing a willingness to compromise on the administration's biggest objections He said he also promised them a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote on the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement by the end of the year. `` I do n't want to push them into a corner of threatening vetoes,'' he said. `` They would be smart if they did n't threaten vetoes, if they hedged a little bit on that because we can modify some things.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made it clear that some version of a measure requiring employers to provide their workers 60 days advance notice of plant closings will be in the final package. But he indicated that a sacrifice will likely be made of a provision in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill written by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. Both provisions have shared the status as the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s top legislative priority for more than two years. Both also share the biggest focus of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> veto threats. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s measure, a primary theme in his presidential campaign, would mandate retaliatory import quotas or tariffs on some countries if they do not reduce their trade imbalances with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 10 percent a year. His use of TV spots, warning <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that if it did n't open up its markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods it could face <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs he said would raise the price of a Korean-made <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> car to $ 48,000 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was credited with reviving his campaign with a victory in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> complained of a `` fixation'' on the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> measure, predicting that the conferees will agree on `` something in between'' it and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> modification that links the enforcement mechanism more to how much <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to a particular country rise. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said unions still prefer the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> language, which is aimed primarily at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Despite the large devaluation of the dollar against most foreign currencies last year that helped send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports surging, the trade imbalance with those four countries widened by more than an additional $ 8 billion last year to more than $ 100 billion. `` We continue to insist that whatever comes out must be substantive, forceful and effective and not simply an expression of pious good wishes,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported net income for the fourth quarter of 1987 fell 39 percent to $ 192.96 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with the year-ago period. In the 1986 fourth quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 314.5 million, or 82 cents a share, augmented partly from the sale of 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, its new bottling subsidiary. Net operating revenue during the final 1987 quarter totaled $ 1.99 billion, up 16 percent from $ 1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the 12 months ending Dec. 31, the soft drink giant reported net income of $ 916 million, or $ 2.43 per share, down about 2 percent from net income of $ 934 million, or $ 2.42 a share, in 1986. For the 1987 year, net operating revenue totaled $ 7.66 billion, up almost 10 percent from $ 6.98 billion in 1986. `` We emerged from 1987 with a corporate structure focused on our core business and designed to optimize the growth opportunities of each of our businesses,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON>. `` Because of the momentum of our soft drink business, leadership in the citrus market and strategic investments in the bottling and entertainment businesses, we fully expect another strong performance in 1988.'' Sales of soft drink cases to retail stores grew 6 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, he said, and sales of Coca-Cola Classic alone increased 9 percent. Domestic sales of soft drink syrup and concentrates rose 1 percent. Unit sales in foreign markets rose 11 percent for the fourth quarter and 9 percent for the year. Operating profit overseas increased 25 percent for the year, due primarily to a weaker dollar, the company said. Sales of juices and fruit drinks made by <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s food division also were up, although operating income was down 45 percent because of long-range investments in the orange juice business, increased spending on advertising and promotions, and a $ 36 million writeoff for business system changes, the company said. The company noted its <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary combined with <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> in December to form <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is now a free-standing company.
