 Twelve years, three planets and 4.4 billion miles after leaving <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the last stop on an extraordinary tour. `` The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, Voyager project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admnistration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> that may be a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet, the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will swoop within 3,000 miles of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters and the first spacecraft to visit the planet. It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> after traveling 4.43 billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive. Five hours after the closest encounter, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will fly within 25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. The other known moon is Nereid. Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors, were launched from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> in 1977. They visited Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 2 reached Uranus in 1986. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space. Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. At a cost <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> pegged at $ 865 million through the <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> encounter, the Voyagers `` returned more new knowledge about the outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six times <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>'s elongated orbit <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until 2007. Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons, said deputy project scientist <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON>. Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5 - to 12-mile-wide incomplete rings, called `` ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, said physicist <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they detected from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> added. The partial rings, possibly made of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a comet and an ancient moon, he said. Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s clouds when it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an unseen arc, he said. The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the internal heat driving <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s comes decaying radioactive material in rocks. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> _ like neighboring <LOCATION> Uranus </LOCATION> _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> receives 900 times less sunlight than <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly the size of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of Voyager's flyby. When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet rotates. <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new backwards-moving satellite, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that Voyager might photograph. Observations from Earth indicate <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical haze, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles, coating the surface with frozen sludge. Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>? `` The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,'' he said. Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82 years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps cover one pole, then the other Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of nitrogen ice crystals, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated elliptical orbit. <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> astrophysicist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldreich </PERSON> speculates Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object. If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet also may have an aurora like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet `` electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> doubts similar problems at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000 television sets, he said. Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to capture the radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb burning 2.75 billion miles away. `` Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about 2020, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. After <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1 and <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION> 10 and 11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

 Imagine a 20-watt refrigerator light bulb burning in the dark, 2.75 billion miles away. Now imagine the sophisticated eyes needed to see the light. Voyager 2, heading for <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, is emitting 20 watts of radio signals, information coded in binary bits _ ones and zeros _ on the space probe's health and from its scientific instruments and cameras. `` Think of that lightbulb as flickering, and that flickering contains the information that <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> is sending back to us,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON>, Voyager preparation manager for the Very Large Array radio telescope. The signals have become fainter since Voyager's encounters with Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. The signals, and commands sent to the 12-year-old probe, take four hours and six minutes to cross 2.75 billion miles at the speed of light. Larger antennas and more sensitive receivers are needed on Earth to receive the signals, and more power is needed to transmit commands to the craft, which will pass fly within 3,000 miles of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> on Aug. 24. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Deep Space Network is used to talk to Voyager. The DSN has three complexes: <PERSON> Goldstone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; and Tidbinbilla, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>. When Voyager flew by Uranus, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and Australian listening posts used three antenna dishes each _ one 210 feet across and two 112 feet _ and the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> station used one of each, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> complex also was linked to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s 210-foot <ORGANIZATION> Parkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION>. For <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the 210-foot dishes at <LOCATION> Goldstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> have been increased to 230 feet and another 112-foot antenna was built at <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> VLA </ORGANIZATION> is being used in conjunction with <PERSON> Goldstone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Parkes </PERSON> again is linked with <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, and a Japanese telescope will be added to the network. The different sites ensure that at least one station can communicate with the spacecraft despite the Earth's rotation, <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> VLA </LOCATION> alone gives us almost a third more images than if we did n't have it,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, Voyager project manager at <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> VLA </ORGANIZATION> is a one-of-a-kind space-age erector set sitting on an ancient lake bed. The site is skirted by four mountain ranges, protecting it from much of the electronic interference from television, radios, aircraft and the like. It consists of 27 white dish-shaped antennas, each 82 feet in diameter, 92 feet high and weighing 235 tons. The dishes sit on the Plains of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustin </LOCATION> amid tumbleweed, cattle and sparse vegetation at an altitude of 7,000 feet. The dishes are arranged along three arms of railroad track, laid out in the shape of a Y. Two arms are 13 miles long and the third is 11.8 miles. The Earth rotates the Y like a turntable, creating images that have the same detail as if using a radio telescope up to 26 miles in diameter. A special 36-wheel transporter moves each antenna to one of 72 observation stations along the three arms. This acts like a zoom lens _ the farther out the dishes, the higher the resolution; the closer in, the larger the field of view. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 6.5 million to equip each dish to receive Voyager's signals It also set up special techniques and installed two big diesel generators to guard against lightning-caused power fluctuations during the thunderstorm season. The separation of the listening posts around the world _ just like the separation of the <ORGANIZATION> VLA </ORGANIZATION> dishes _ strengthen the sensitivity of the network. The signal <ORGANIZATION> VLA </ORGANIZATION> gets from Voyager is sent via satellite to <PERSON> Goldstone </PERSON>, where the two signals are combined, decoded and sent via microwave to <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The young woman's enthusiasm was contagious. `` I did it, I did it,'' she said, smiling broadly and barely standing still after casting her first vote in a democratic election. The right to vote is taken for granted _ and often ignored _ in countries with a longer tradition of rule by and for the people. But in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, brutalized by 50 years of war, Stalinism, police repression, false propaganda and economic mismanagement, that simple act in the Polish national elections June 4 seemed nothing short of a miracle. Communist rule came to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as the result of the World War II military might of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but perestroika and glasnost under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are giving countries that used to be referred to as `` satellites'' the leeway to experiment with democracy. Economic pressures are also helping the cause of political reforms. With communist economies proven unable to compete with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in a high-technology age, the ideological rationale for Marxism-Leninism _ that it makes life better for the common man and woman _ has been stripped away. In the course of one or two years, the concept of free competition among different political parties has gone from being an unimaginable dream to being hoped for and even counted on in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Poles and Hungarians will even get a rare, firsthand look at the leader of a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> democracy this month, when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stops to visit prior to the annual summit of industrialized democracies in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will find a <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that has just held the first democratic parliamentary elections since World War II, in which candidates backed by the Solidarity movement took 99 of the 100 seats. The elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> were not free; the opposition was allowed only to run for 35 percent of the seats. Solidarity took all 161 of those. Its platform: Remove the party's `` leading role'' and hold free elections in four years. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, that might be too slow. A commission is working to draft a constitution expected to provide for fully free multiparty elections as early as next year. It also will guarantee free speech, independent courts and other human rights. The rapid pace of democratic change in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was underlined by the reburial with honors June 16 of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, leader of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt, who was executed for treason. Hundreds of thousands of people were on hand for the ceremony and joined a veteran of 1956 in swearing: `` We will never again be slaves.'' Party leaders in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have been quoted as saying they hope the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will win planned free elections in the future, but if not, the party will accept the voters' verdict and relinquish power. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the opposition is led by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the Solidarity movement which embraces workers, intellectuals and much of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, reform is mainly the work of intellectuals, including a potent liberal wing of the communist party itself. Both countries already have seen the spontaneous reformation of long-banned political parties and associations, as if they only were in suspended animation for the past half century. There also are totally new political grouping, such as environmentally conscious `` Greens.'' Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, democratization is not so advanced, where it exists at all. What is happening in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has raised hopes among some citizens while disquieting the mostly aging leaderships. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the most hardline states, have commented with dismay on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s move toward democracy. `` Under the flag of ` renewing socialism,' forces are at work that strive for removing socialism,'' said East German Politburo member <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> said the ceremonies to honor <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> were `` clearly fascist, anti-socialist in nature.'' Both countries brook no dissent. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, dissidents are jailed while in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> they are likely to find themselves deported to the West. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the Czechoslovak leadership has paid enthusiastic lip service to the Kremlin reforms, but failed so far to implement them amid an ongoing, if secretive debate about whether change is needed. In <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> remains true to a lifetime of skillfully aping whatever policy holds sway in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In July 1987, he embraced economic reform, exciting <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s intelligentsia and younger technocrats. But <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and longtime comrades on the ruling <PERSON> Poltiburo </PERSON> blocked dissent within the party last year. Dissident groups, the first seen in four decades of communist rule, are closely watched by security forces and troublemakers are expelled. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the communist party leadership in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the most economically advanced of the country's six republics, has tolerated a broad degree of pluralism, while rejecting demands for multiparty democracy from mushrooming independent groups. Those calls have been echoed by intellectuals in <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Servia </PERSON>, the two largest republics, but ethnic tensions among the republics have complicated any broad alliance for reform. Serbian President <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, however, uses authoritarian tactics and insists on one-party, orthodox communist rule, putting him at odds with other republics _ particularly the Slovenes, who are now threatening secession if conflicts go unresolved.

 Thunderstorms packing 90 mph gusts roared through northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> late Sunday, and rivers continued to rise in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The flooding, the aftermath of record rainfall from Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, could continue for weeks, meteorolgists said. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> fire officials received reports of two tornadoes touching down. The storms knocked down power lines, leaving about 50,000 homes without electricity, authorities said. About a dozen mobile homes near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> were knocked off foundations and struck by wind-blown trees, said <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>. There were no immediate reports of injuries. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, at least 700 homes and numerous roads remained flooded, with scattered storms and showers replacing the unremitting rain of the previous five days. One town got nearly 29 inches of rain in less than a week. A tornado destroyed a taxidermy business and 70 mph winds swept the outskirts of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, in the central part of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribaudo </PERSON> of the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Department. <PERSON> Ribaudo </PERSON> said he could n't tell if the storm would worsen flooding in the area. `` It's already so bad one more storm does n't seem like anything,'' he said. An earthen dam in another rural part of the state was reported near collapse, and most residents near it had evacuated. In <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, a 12-year-old boy died when he jumped into a storm-flooded ditch and was sucked into a culvert Saturday afternoon, one of three deaths blamed on the storm, authorities said. Four deaths were blamed on the storm in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, authorities braved rain and lightning to search for a teen-ager missing after he and a companion went swimming in a swollen creek. The body of the companion was recovered early Sunday near <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>, on the east bank of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. About 180 miles north, about 200 people were evacuated from <LOCATION> Coahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> homes as a flood swept through their neighborhoods. During the night, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>'s leftover rain and thunderstorms moved slowly eastward and shifted the heavy rain pattern into the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> valleys. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said fields and timberland were likely to stay flooded for weeks because there was nowhere for all the water to go. `` The Red River itself is at bank-full from Grand Ecore downstream to <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> and below,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON>, a weather service meteorologist in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>. `` All these tributaries that received the torrential rains are unable to empty their water into the main channel,'' he said. `` So it spreads out, becomes a big lake.'' At least 10 parishes _ <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s equivalent of counties _ got 12 to 15 inches of rain, he said, with 20 inches or more measured in <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION> parishes. He said some lakes and rivers crested Sunday and others were expected to do so Monday or later. All were flooding, he said. In <LOCATION> Winn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, about 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, deputies kept watch on the deteriorating <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION>, which initially had been expected to collapse by daybreak. `` It's doing better than we thought it would. But it's not going to hold long,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>. `` Some trees that were holding it yesterday washed out during the night. Now it's just dirt.'' He said no evacuation had been ordered, but most of the people in the 50 or so homes nearby left on their own. `` There's people getting smart and getting out,'' he said. About 100 houses were evacuated around <LOCATION> Saline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, along the western edge of the parish. Downstream, authorities estimated that the flooded lake <LOCATION> Saline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where about 100 houses were evacuated, would rise at least an extra foot if the Mirror Lake Dam broke. <PERSON> Winnfield </PERSON> got the week's worst rain _ 28.75 inches since Wednesday. `` The sun's out ... and the water's receding at the present,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. However, he said, more storms were expected and the <LOCATION> Dugdemona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> had not yet crested. About 100 houses were flooded in the town. `` I would imagine our economy is going to suffer,'' he said. At the weather service, <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> said <PERSON> Winnfield </PERSON> got 32 inches of rain in June _ the wettest month on record and 7 inches above the previous record, set in December 1983. <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> had its wettest June ever, with 17.01 inches of rain. He said lowland flooding would continue to increase for the next few days, and then probably remain for a couple of weeks.

<TEXT>
 The governor of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> told anti-abortion lobbyists Saturday that legalized abortion contributes to dropouts, suicides and low self-esteem among youth. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention two days before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was expected to rule on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could determine the future of legalized abortion in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said abortions contributed to a `` vacuum of values'' among the youth. `` What kind of signal are we as a society sending them about the value of life? We need to send an unmistakable message that there is a fundamental value in life itself,'' he said. The law being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> puts restrictions on abortions and defines life as beginning at conception. Upholding the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, or even parts of it, could reverse or seriously erode the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortion. `` The <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> decision is simply a miserable failure,'' <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> said, drawing loud applause. `` And I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> announces it is overturning the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> decision and giving back to the states the right to make public policy.'' The court has said it may rule Monday on the case, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services, or delay its decision for further review. Earlier Saturday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, told delegates they must not become complacent in light of victories the movement has achieved over the last 20 years. `` We've got to regroup. We've got to rededicate. We've got to realize that the fight is just beginning,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Over the past two decades, our message has been getting through. Our efforts are bearing fruit. Without us, it would have gotten worse,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, one of three congressmen with strong anti-abortion records in the House. In the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> suburb of <LOCATION> Robbinsdale </LOCATION>, meanwhile, about 300 protesters on both sides of the issue picketed and sang Saturday morning outside a clinic where abortions are performed <PERSON> Dixie </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said NOW representatives were on hand `` to make sure that the women can get into the clinic and exercise their constitutional right _ for as long as it lasts. We all know the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision is being reconsidered.''

<TEXT>
 A bomb exploded early Sunday at a crowded exhibition attended by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and senior members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, but they escaped injury, police said. However, at least one person was killed and 30 were wounded, they said. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred shortly after midnight at a government-sponsored exhibition in <LOCATION> Mahiyangana </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. But police blamed members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a left-wing ethnic Sinhalese group trying to overthrow the Sinhalese-dominated government. Also Sunday, security forces in the south arrested 3,237 Sinhalese youths suspected of belonging to the front, according to a police official in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. It was the largest such crackdown against the group in nearly two years, said the officer, who can not be identified under briefing rules. The front has been blamed for more than 3,500 killings since July 1987, when Indian peacekeeping forces arrived on this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island to enforce a peace accord between the government and the Tamil minority. The front contends the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils and the Indian soldiers threaten Sri Lankan sovereignty. Front members have vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact. Last month, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to pull out its troops by the end of July. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> refused, saying a quick withdrawal could stir even more ethnic violence. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> under a peace accord signed by Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. The accord proposed to give Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for surrendering their weapons, but militant Tamils rejected it. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, contend they suffer job and educational discrimination. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
 In the office of <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, hangs a small framed copy of a once-secret message that reminds him both of atomic power's promise a generation ago and its troubles today. `` Under way on nuclear power,'' says the flash from the USS Nautilus, signalling the launching of the maiden voyage of the first vessel in the world to be propelled by a nuclear reactor. The date was Jan. 17, 1955, and <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> was a crew member. He remembers that historic moment as a high-water mark in the military use of nuclear power. A generation later, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, 64, is taking the helm of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> with the commercial nuclear power industry at a low ebb, crippled in large part by a widespread public fear of the atom _ a fear <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says is irrational but powerful and enduring. From his first day Monday as chairman of the federal agency that regulates commercial nuclear power, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says he intends to press the search for ways of overcoming public opposition to nuclear plants. He has no illusions of quick success. `` I think it's going to be a generational change before you get the public acceptance,'' he said in a recent interview. No electric utility has ordered a nuclear plant in this country since 1978, and even nuclear power's biggest advocates see no sign of the drought ending soon. Public opposition is n't the only reason for nuclear's stagnation, but <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> thinks it's the one obstacle most deeply rooted in the history of atomic power. Today's adult population, he says, was introduced to nuclear power in an era in which strict secrecy, not public education, was the watchword of nuclear's promoters and regulators. The result was a mystic of little-understood danger. `` We tried to keep it bottled up, keep the genie in the bottle, even long after it was out,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says, noting a determination of the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> administrations to guard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear know-how not only from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other potential <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enemies but also friendly nations and even the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public. `` I think we did n't do a good job at all of educating the public,'' he says. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> is a native of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. He retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as a vice admiral in 1985, last serving as deputy and chief of staff to the commander in chief <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. He was a crewman on an assault landing craft in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> theater during World War II. Later he was appointed to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> as a member of the class of 1949. Among his honors are the Distinguished Service Medal and Legion of Merit. His experience in the nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> firsthand knowledge of the nuclear secrecy he now bemoans. Even more basic to Americans' unease about the atom, he says, is a lingering memory of the stunning destruction caused by the only two nuclear bombs ever dropped _ on the Japanese cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> in August 1945. `` That's what our generation sees when the words ` nuclear' and ` atomic' come; they see that big ball over there and they see that picture of that one building standing there in the rubble,'' he says. The only thing that will change that, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> believes, is the passage of time and a stronger effort by government and industry to teach young people about nuclear energy. If they fully understand it, he says, they wo n't fear it. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> is replacing another retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer, <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, as <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. He has high praise for <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>, who served with <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> on the USS Nautilus for two years and has been a close associate since <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> became an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> commissioner in 1986. `` Now he's leaving me _ bailed out on me,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says, using the maritime lingo that frequently flavors his speech. During the two years he expects to spend as chairman, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says his top goal will be to set the ground rules for deciding whether to extend the operating licenses of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plants. The licenses of existing plants are good for 40 years, and the first expirations will come toward the end of the century. Decisions must be made soon, he says, because utilities need at least 10 years lead time to replace their plants if it's decided that four decades of use make the reactors too dangerous to keep using.

 Police at an international youth festival seized Danish and Finnish human rights banners, and some European delegates Sunday accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of using the festival for self-promotion. More than 15,000 people from 180 countries are in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, the biggest international gathering ever staged by the communist government. The banners were seized at the opening cremonies Saturday. The Danish banner read `` Human rights in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> too,'' while <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s banner protested <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s refusal to allow the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to attend the one-week event. The Finn delegation had decided to drop out of the festival to protest the confiscation but reversed its decision Sunday, after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> apologized and said two <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> representatives would be given visas to attend. <PERSON> Matti </PERSON> <PERSON> Tohianen </PERSON> of the Finnish delegation said police hit the hands of the four students carrying the banner and grabbed it during opening ceremonies. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> apparently balked at allowing <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> representation because the group has criticized <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s human rights record. The Danish delegation also was considering pulling out of the festival after police briefly detained three of its members for unfurling the human rights banner during a speech by President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. The Union of <ORGANIZATION> Nordic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the confiscation of banners was `` not within the spirit of the festival.'' Other delegates said they had received letters from the North Koreans warning they would be held personally responsible for any actions at the opening ceremony that were critical of the host country or other participants. A Norwegian delegate said her group smuggled in a banner expressing solidarity with the suppressed Chinese pro-democracy movement. The Finnish delegates also circulated a statement calling for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government to `` respect the freedom of expression and stop the ongoing arrests and executions.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has supported <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in that country. Twenty-seven people have been executed since the movement was crushed by the military last month. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said her group was `` not happy'' about the staging of the festival in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, one of the world's most closed and tightly controlled nations. She complained about the `` orchestrated chanting of national slogans'' at the opening ceremony, in which 70,000 North Koreans performed in a three-hour music, dance and light show. <PERSON> Tor-Hugne </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>, called for a ban on opening and closing ceremonies. `` We want festivals to be international events, and not events of the host country,'' he said. The festival, last held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1985, brings together youth from socialist countries and mainly leftist organizations to discuss political topics and stage various art, theatrical and sports shows. The festival organizers refused to put the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> events on the agenda. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has set out to use the festival to show the world it can stage an international event as successfully as the rival South Korean government, which was host to the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last year. Dozens of new stadiums, hotels and apartments have been built, and many of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s 2 million people have been mobilized to prepare or participate in the festival. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, about 1,000 radical students gathered at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday to protest the government ban on participation in the youth festival Relations have been strained between the two Koreas since the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula was divided in 1945 into the communist North and capitalist South. The countries fought a war from 1950 to 1953 and remain bitter enemies.

 More than 5,000 doctors at state-run hospitals ended a 47-day-old strike Sunday that had paralyzed medical care to the city's poor. The doctors are to return to work Monday, according to negotiators for the government and the Junior Doctors Federation. The agreement ending the strike was signed following negotiations that stretched through the night. The doctors had demanded pay raises, higher allowances for not being allowed to maintain private practices, and schedules for promotion. Under the agreement, the doctors will receive raises of $ 25 a month, less than half they had sought. Their monthly salaries average $ 200 to $ 269.

 The letter to <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, an aide to the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, did n't waste any words. `` Dear Debbie,'' it began. `` HELP! `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, a financial consultant who was working on behalf of a community organization, said he was at the end of his rope that July day a few years ago. In his case, the plea did not work. In many others, it did. An examination of Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s correspondence during her years at the top of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> shows that help was her business _ particularly for certain developers and well-connected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consultants. Relatively few of the hundreds of letters released by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> were signed by Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. However, accompanying documents show that she gave the final approval to many letters over the signature of her boss, then-housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. They were then signed by a machine at her command. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, 34, is at the center of investigations of influence peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, where she has been identified as the person who controlled millions of dollars for housing rehabilitation. She has refused to testify before a congressional panel investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, citing her constitutional right against self incrimination. And aside from earlier interviews with The Wall Street Journal, she has avoided contact with the news media. Last week, when she accidentally answered a call at her lawyer's office from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, she politely but firmly declined to talk and quickly put her attorney on the phone. Her rise through the ranks at the department was stymied only by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which derailed her nomination to be assistant <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary. But it was from her post as executive assistant to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the job she held until she left the department in 1987, that she exerted her control. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said in an interview that he had gotten nowhere in trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to boost a rent subsidy for a housing development on the south side of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> already had given money to fix up the project, but it needed higher rent subsidies to make it financially workable, he said. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> wound up seeking the help of Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` I took a shot and called her,'' he said. `` She was always very polite to me and very nice and offering to be of help but I did n't get anywhere, never translated into anything positive, unfortunately. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> was n't alone. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrote to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to push for projects back home. Often they got letters back saying all the money had already been spent. In the spring of 1985, for example, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., wrote a `` Dear Sam'' letter to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> Although the news was bad, the tone was friendly when he got back letter addressed `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>'' and signed just `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' The letter's tone was set by Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, as was the signature. On formal occasions she would have the machine, called an autopen, sign `` <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>,'' but when the mood called for it, she would have the letter signed `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' Internal file slips from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, carrying the initials of everyone in the chain of command reviewing a particular piece or correspondence, indicate that the final stop before the mail box was at Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s desk. It is not known whether <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> himself saw any of the correspondence because his initials are not on the slips. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, whose hands-off style of management at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been sharply criticized in the wake of disclosures about political influence, costly misjudgments and outright stealing that plagued the department, has said he was betrayed by his aides and singled out Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` She liked power,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` She liked the idea that, ` I can call the shots, I can get this for you if I want, I can stomp on you, I can kill you' _ that's the kind of thing she liked.'' Among the people who beat a path to her door were former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political consultant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser and now ambassador-designate to <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who now is ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. All of them came away with money for the projects they represented, bringing some of them six-figure fees from grateful clients. But Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who held little formal authority at the department, occasionally invoked that lack of official power to give people the brush off. `` First, I feel I must explain once again,'' she wrote in 1985 to <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who was seeking funds for a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> project. `` Neither I nor Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> have any authority to designate moderate rehabilitation funds to you or your client. I have tried to make this clear in the past. `` They are issued on a competitive basis, and there are far more requests than there are units available,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> wrote. No one would dispute that there were more requests for help than there was help available, but few people would agree that the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds were awarded in fair competition. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of a subcommittee investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, has called the notion of competition `` a sham and an illusion. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, who said he was personally hurt for a while that his social contacts with Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> did not translate into money, has become forgiving over time. `` Unfortunately, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> sometimes tells you things that are n't necessarily accurate,'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said `` It's not because she means badly, it's that she over commits herself.''

 A fierce dispute over the future of organized crime strike forces, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s shock troops in the war against the mob, is heating up within the law enforcement community. `` This is a turf fight _ it's as simple as that,'' says <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaira </PERSON>, a former strike force chief in that city who once headed the President's Commission on Organized Crime. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing is set for July 21 on the strike forces, teams of prosecutors initially established by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to specialize in organized crime and labor racketeering. Currently based in 14 cities, they have compiled a record of achievements that even critics call impressive. Organized crime leaders from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other cities are currently serving long prison terms as a result of strike force investigations. Indeed, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> strike force chief, recalls a wiretap as early as 1981 in which hoodlums were heard to speak hopefully of chances that the strike forces would be disbanded. Actually, the strike forces will be disbanded _ in effect, if not in name _ under a plan announced by Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, say supporters of the units within the legal community. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> plans to place the strike forces, which now report directly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, under the control of presidentially appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, who traditionally have been the top federal prosecutors in their communities. `` I think it's an unfortunate decision,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogovin </PERSON>. `` Essentially what is being done is the dismantling of an apparatus that has really developed a remarkable kind of expertise.'' Former strike force officials say there have been resignations in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that in part were caused by <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s plan. In fact, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> says it was `` one factor'' in his own departure. He says he had battled for years to hold the strike forces together and, `` I just did n't have the energy to fight this fight one more time.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, formerly chief of the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> strike force, is critical of what officials `` euphemistically call the merger of the strike forces. I like to call it the abolition or destruction of the strike forces.'' Nonsense, retort <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. They say the plan guarantees that the strike force will remain intact but under control of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, thus ending squabbling and rivalries. `` Are we going to spend 30 percent of our time arguing over whose case this is? Or are we going to make the case?'' asks <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, assistant attorney general and No. 2 official at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Praise is coming from virtually all of the nation's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. `` I think this is an excellent idea,'' says <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. `` What it would do is substantially increase our ability to continue the war on organized crime.'' Gone are the days when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys lacked the sophistication to launch the complex undercover investigations needed to catch mobsters, says <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. He points to the `` Operation Graylord'' cases that revealed widespread bribery in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> courts and resulted in conviction of scores of judges, lawyers and court officials. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, chairman of the 15-member Attorney General's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, points to stunning successes of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the strike force was merged into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. The arrangement has produced some spectacular successes against organized crime. `` This will certainly not diminish the fight against organized crime,'' says <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. `` It will enhance it.'' Current strike force attorneys have remained silent in the debate. One current strike force prosecutor, who asked not to be identified by name, cited a March 9 memo from <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> warning that violations of publicity guidelines could mean firing. Former strike force chiefs, however, have mounted a lobbying campaign designed to save their old program. They say <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has carried a longstanding grudge against the program. `` He had innumerable run-ins with the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> strike force when he was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in the early 1970s and it left a bad taste in his mouth,'' says <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roller </PERSON>, former strike force chief in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. And questions have been raised concerning the strong political ties that usually mark relations between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys and the local establishments in their communities. Indeed, the post of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney has been a launching pad for many political careers. `` The loyalties of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys are to the senators who nominated them,'' says <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and now a conservative analyst of the federal court system. The issue came up at a June 20 hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> criminal justice subcommittee when Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., questioned <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> `` There are always a lot of calls like, ` Old <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> has been a good contributor to the party for all these years and it's a shame that you're doing to him what you are,''' <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON> said. `` I think the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney should be completely absolved from that.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> suggested that in such a case the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney might recuse himself _ bow out to avoid a conflict _ and let an aide make the decision. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney is not going to recuse himself because somebody down in the party says take it easy on <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>,'' Sangmeister shot back. `` You do n't recuse yourself for stuff like that.''

 An Afghan government airliner crashed in the country's southern <LOCATION> Helmand </LOCATION> province, killing 35 people, a rebel-controlled news agency said Sunday. The Afghan News Agency, which is based in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, did not say whether the June 26 crash involved a civilian or military aircraft. There was no indpendent confirmation of the crash. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government-run radio did not report it The guerrilla news agency said it was unclear whether the crash was caused by mechinical failure or whether it was shot down by rebels. The guerrillas have been fighting the country's Soviet-backed government for more than a decade The guerrilla-run news agency also reported that rebels shot down three government helicopters during the past week. Two were downed near the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, killing 29 government soldiers being transported to bolster government troops defending the city from rebel attacks, the news agency reported. The third helicopter was shot down in the northwestern province of <LOCATION> Badghis </LOCATION>, it said. The report could not be independently confirmed.

<HEAD>Pleasure Boat Fatals Down Dramatically, But Congested Waters Heighten
Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fatal accidents involving recreational boaters have decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but many weekend skippers fear increasing congestion in waters has made pleasure trips more dangerous than ever. Fewer recreational boaters were killed last year than in any year since the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> began charting such statistics in 1961, despite a 300 percent increase in the number of pleasure crafts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters. `` Without a doubt, the waters are safer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON>, government relations manager at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a dramatic improvement.'' The fatality rate, which peaked at 20.2 deaths per 100,000 boats in 1971, was 5.5 per 100,000 boats last year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said 946 recreational boaters died in 1988, the first time the number fatalities has dipped below 1,000. The number of boats, meanwhile, has increased from less than 6 million to an estimated 17.3 million. But not everyone believes the fatality statistics are a reflection of a safer boating environment. `` I dare say the waters are probably less safe than they were 20 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciulla </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which represents 310,000 recreational boat owners. `` I hear from many boat owners that they are fearful of drunk boaters, that they are fearful of boat owners who do n't know the rules of the road, and they're fearful because of the increasing congestion of boats on our waterways.'' And congestion, it seems, will only get worse. In 1961, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated that there were 5.85 million pleasure crafts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters. The estimate for 1988 was 17.3 million, a threefold increase. `` Boating is approaching a $ 20 billion industry,'' <PERSON> Sciulla </PERSON> said. `` Seventy-five million Americans hop in a boat -LRB- at least -RRB- once a year. It's become an extraordinarily popular pastime over the past few decades.'' The boating explosion over the past 25 years may explain another <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> statistic that stands in stark contrast to the declining fatality rate: the rising number of reported accidents and reported injuries. Reported boating injuries increased from 2,757 in 1985 to 3,476 three years later. Boating officials, however, are quick to point out that only about 10 percent of the non-fatal marine accidents are reported. `` When the figures change, it's not easy to tell if there are more or less accidents or better reporting or other factors. It's hard to draw conclusions,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmo </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s auxiliary, boating and consumer affairs division Even if congestion is causing more accidents and injuries, most experts agree the steadily declining fatality rate is impressive. The first turning point in recreational marine safety came in 1971 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a sweeping safety law that included mandatory federal standards for boat construction. In the 11 years before the law was enacted, the annual fatality rate was 19.8 per 100,000 boats. Over the next 17 years, the average fatality rate was less than 10 per 100,000 boats. After dipping dramatically in the first five years following enactment of the federal law, from 20.2 to 9.9 per 100,000 boats, the fatality rate leveled off through the late 1970s. The rate, however, continued its downward spiral during the 1980s, from 9.5 in 1980 to 5.5 last year. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s auxiliary, boating and consumer affairs division, attributes much of the recent decrease to public awareness programs targeting drunkenness at sea

<HEAD>American Move to Bases a Further Blow to Panama's Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen and civilians finished moving over the weekend onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, widening the rift with the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> says the move is intended to `` maintain a low military profile in the face of harassment by the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in recent months.'' It also seems designed to increase pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader. It will deprive the country's already battered economy of about $ 60 million a year the Americans were spending. They will now make purchases in stores and other facilities within the Southern Command. A total of 6,400 Americans, including dependents, were involved in the move, which was ordered in May by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> when violence broke out after the May 7 presidential election. Government opponents and international observers said opposition candidates won the vote by 3-1. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> voided the results, alleging interference in the campaign by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, which has been trying to oust him since his indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last year on drug trafficking charges. The move to military bases involved not only servicemen, but also civilian employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and its various branches. All had been living in houses and apartments off-base. On-base, unmarried personnel are assigned to regular barracks, while married people and families live in military housing. The biggest complaint is lack of privacy. Civilians especially were reluctant to move. One civilian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did `` not see the reason for it, since this was not a war zone.'' However, there were 55 reports of harassment by Panamanian authorities in May and six in June. They included the detention of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel who were questioned by police in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for alleged petty offenses and then released. The mass move also disappointed some Panamanians who profited from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence off-base. `` It is going to be hard to rent those apartments again soon,'' said a superintendent of one 34-unit apartment building. It was leased early this year by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> for its servicemen and employees. A real estate agent, who like the superintendent spoke on condition of anonymity, said the building owners went into debt to finance improvements _ special water tanks, air conditioning, security _ as conditions for a contract with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. `` They thought they were looking at long-term contracts,'' the agent said. The Americans were paying $ 15 million a year in rents alone in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Their rent and the other money they spent helped keep this country's economy barely afloat after more than a year of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions imposed following <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was a leading international financial center with about 120 banks holding an estimated $ 30 billion in assets. A flight of capital caused by the more than yearlong political struggle over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule has reduced assets to about $ 8 billion, according to government figures. Opposition leaders say unemployment last year more than doubled to 23 percent. In March, Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said U.S.-imposed sanctions, which barred payments to the government, caused a 20 percent drop in the gross national product in 1988. A total of 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are on duty in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>'s 10 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> installations in this country. The troops include 2,000 sent in May by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests after the election.

<HEAD>35 Soldiers A Year Commit Suicide In The Israeli Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 35 soldiers in the Israeli army commit suicide each year, the head of the army's personnel department said in a newspaper interview published Sunday. Thirty-two soldiers committed suicide from April 1988 to April 1989, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Matan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilnai </PERSON> told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>. The military command confirmed the figures. <PERSON> Vilnai </PERSON>'s interview was a departure from the military's customary reluctance to provide such data, which could have a negative effect on soldiers' morale. No figures on attempted suicides were given. The newspaper and army said the average of 35 suicides was for recent years, but they did not say which years. Neither <PERSON> Vilnai </PERSON> nor the military command knew if any of the suicides were related to the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vilnai </PERSON> said 30 percent of those who killed themselves were reservists troubled by family and financial problems. They are pushed into the act by the availability of weapons and the hope that relatives will get financial compensation from the army, he said. Israeli men are drafted at the age of 18 for a three-year period of regular duty, and serve up to 40 days a year as reservists until age 55. Women are drafted for two years of regular service, and some of them are required to serve as reservists afterward. The Tel Aviv-based <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a 170,000-strong standing army and 370,000 reserves. <PERSON> Vilnai </PERSON> said an average of two to three female soldiers commit suicide every year. He said most of the regular soldiers who have killed themselves did so during the first year of their military duty. <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said the army's personnel department recently issued instructions on how to spot troubled soldiers to prevent suicides. However, the paper said `` This activity is quite limited since it is feared that dealing with the question of suicide may in fact increase the number of suicides.''

<TEXT>
 Latin jazz night has become a fixture at the annual <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, and Saturday night's edition provided a fine cross-section of jazz, salsa and entertaining combinations of the two. The headliners were the Fania Six, all-star musicians from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. They were preceded by flutist <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, whose 35-year career has been on the rise during the last few years since he formed the Brazilian group <ORGANIZATION> Brasil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION>. The evening was opened _ and nearly stolen _ by the fiery Dominican jazz pianist <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON>. The crowded bill limited <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON>'s set to about half an hour, but in that time he generated enough energy to light a town of 10,000 for a week. <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON>'s command of the piano is unlike anything else heard in jazz. He is a consummate technician. Yet he keeps his technique under the tightest control, never allowing it to outrun his musical ideas. He played only his own compositions, taken from his latest album. The tunes revealed him to be a composer of considerable depth and inventiveness, particularly in the beautiful ballad `` Nostalgia.'' He introduced as his special guest <PERSON> Paquito </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Rivera </PERSON>, in whose group <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> first came to prominence. The two have recorded together but no longer tour together. But they have n't lost their rapport; <PERSON> D'Rivera </PERSON> was ready to match <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON>'s fireworks. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s group was a disappointment, but that may not have been entirely his fault. The restraint and sophistication of <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s Brazilian-inflected group was a poor choice to follow <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> Although <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> is the bigger name, he should have opened for <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON>. His second problem was a poorly adjusted sound system. The bass, critical for the rhythmic sway of Brazilian music, was inaudible through much of <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s set. He repeatedly indicated to off-stage technicians that he could n't hear himself play, but the problem apparently was never corrected His special guest was <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON>, a flutist who <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> recalled encouraging when <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> was 16. Despite the sound problems, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON>'s arrival on stage gave <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s group some needed energy, and it became clear that the group had not been at its best. The highlight of the evening was the last set by the Fania Six, a group of Puerto Rican musicians -LRB- some of them based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- associated with the Fania record label. They are <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> on flute and vocals, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Barretto </PERSON> on congas, <LOCATION> Papo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucca </LOCATION> on piano, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> on bass, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roena </PERSON> on bongos and <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> on timbales. This was classic salsa. They rhythms were irresistible, the melodies engaging and the solos impressive. <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> made part of the set into a flute extravaganza when he invited <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> on stage. The three flutists played off one another, reaching peaks they could n't have scaled alone. It was one of those special moments that can occur in jazz festivals, in which artists who do n't normally perform together are suddenly thrust on stage at the same time.

 Thousands of people shouting `` Shame, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>! Shame!'' protested the arrival of British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> on Sunday and denounced his country's refusal to give refuge to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents. `` <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> go home,'' a crowd of about 10,000 chanted as they raised their fists in front of <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> is staying on his three-day fact-finding mission. `` Justice for the people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>!'' About 5,000 protesters also massed at the airport and about 1,000 mostly Western residents held their own rally in support of the protesters. The military crackdown on pro-democracy student protesters in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has caused much apprehension in this British colony, which is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> rejected a proposal to allow British passport holders in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to emigrate to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> About 3.5 million of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million people hold British passports. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> citizens believe that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> can not be trusted to live up to its promise to keep <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist system intact for 50 years after 1997. In brief remarks upon his arrival, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> did not raise the issue of mass immigration from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. He said he had come here to `` reaffirm British determination to secure a democratic and prosperous future for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.'' `` You have no stauncher friend than <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The whole world has condemned the violence and repression we've all witnessed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over the last few weeks,'' he added `` Nowhere has that view been more vigorously expressed than in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. You feel threatened and beleaguered by what has happened, so that's why I'm here.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the British government believed that the 1984 British-Chinese agreement to return <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` still provides the right foundations'' for the future. At the airport, demonstration leaders gave <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s personal secretary a petition with about 600,000 signatures pressing for the right to emigrate to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The protest organizer, the Rev. Lo <PERSON> Lung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwong </PERSON>, said demonstrators were `` extremely dissatisfied'' that <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> did not accept the petition himself. `` We feel that he does not seem to have the courage to face the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people personally,'' he said. Earlier, about 1,000 Westerners gathered in central <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s visit. `` I've lived here for about 12 years and I consider <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> home,'' said <PERSON> Gasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> businessman who came to the rally with his two sons, both born in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is selling these people down the river. If they do n't act and act fast, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> as a trading center, as a financial center, is finished. All the bright people in my company have left or are leaving.'' Another 10,000 people marched through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to the Government House, carrying signs that read, `` <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> can you sleep at night?'' and `` End to British honor?'' `` I fled the communists in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Fat </PERSON>, a restaurateur who was marching with his family of six. `` I look at these hooligans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and ask myself, ` Am I going to have to flee them again?' We need an assurance _ the right to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would help.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this week will include a trip to the Bastille and talks with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> that likely will cover <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s unwillingness to discuss reducing its nuclear force. The trip comes one week before <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> celebrates the bicentennial of the French Revolution and plays host to a summit of the seven major Western industrialized nations. It will include a visit to <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, where the Soviet president will address the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who arrives Tuesday, will be the first leader from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to speak at the council. He is expected to define more precisely the European role of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that has strived to restructure its economy. `` A very important political declaration from the Soviet leadership to the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> public and political leaders on the subject of a common European house will be the thrust of the speech,'' said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grachev </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s international department, speaking to reporters at a briefing Friday The `` common European home,'' an idea first expressed during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1985, has been a vague concept in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy as the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> seeks to improve relations with its Western European neighbors. The term implies an end to the Cold War and a change in Soviet foreign policy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to use his speech to spell out the kind of cooperation the Soviets are looking for in human rights, environmental protection, culture and the battle against terrorism. In talks with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Tuesday and Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is likely to bring up once again <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s own nuclear arsenal, which the Soviets see as an adjunct of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear force. During his last visit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made sweeping arms control proposals that later were the basis for U.S.-Soviet disarmament negotiations. But he failed to bring <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> into separate talks on reducing <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s independent nuclear force. The French Socialist president told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> then that it was `` not reasonable to think that there could actually be negotiations.'' A spokesman for the presidential palace said Friday that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would like to discuss chemical weapons with his Soviet counterpart as well as regional conflicts such as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The French president also would like to see a reversal in the trade deficit with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ $ 318 million in the first three months of this year compared to $ 773 million for all of 1988. In 1988, the main Soviet exports to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> were oil and gas while <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> imported primarily machinery and equipment. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also plans to tour the Place de la Bastille on Tuesday, where on July 14, 1789 workers stormed a prison fortress, unleashing events that led to the French Revolution. On Wednesday, he will sign a series of <LOCATION> Soviet-French </LOCATION> agreements and have meetings with Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and then with students and intellectuals at the <ORGANIZATION> Sorbonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> again Thursday before leaving for <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>. The visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which took over the rotating chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on July 1, is not expected to break new ground in French-Soviet relations. Nor will the 58-year-old Soviet leader find the French as effusive as the West Germans, who thronged his stops during his visit there last month. Still, polls show <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to be far more popular with the French than President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Match-B.V. A poll last week showed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> inspired confidence in 60 percent of 1,000 French people surveyed while only 51 percent felt the same about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He is more charismatic than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and better known,'' said <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Moisi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the French expect much less of him than the West Germans and they are more skeptical of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Besides, French crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German ones.''

 Passengers walked out of the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> early Sunday and refused to travel to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on a jumbo jet delayed for two days by three separate mechanical problems, the airport manager said. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said 167 passengers got refunds. `` They were clearly sick to death of the whole thing,'' he said. It was the second such incident in four days involving North Carolina-based <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The ordeal began when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> and chartered to the British firm <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION>, was delayed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because of an `` oil problem.'' It finally left <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, but then developed an electrical problem on its way to <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> on Friday. When it arrived in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, a fault was found with the flap control shafts, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. A spare part was flown from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but it was the wrong part, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. The plane finally left <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Sunday, 47 hours late and with only 329 of the 496 passengers who had booked seats. <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> No one answered the telephone at the company headquarters Sunday, and the recording on the answering machine advised callers to try again during business hours Monday through Friday. In <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, 53 British tourists refused to board another <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that was forced to land in the Canadian city Thursday night for repairs. They demanded that the airline make other arrangements to fly them home. The aircraft had been repaired four times during a trip that was supposed to take about 480 passengers on a charter flight from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and back again. To make matters worse, a bus taking passengers from the <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> Inn to the airport caught fire Friday night. No one was hurt but the passengers had to wait for another bus to go the rest of the way. The plane was on the way from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> when it had to land in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>. Many of the passengers lost their patience. It finally left <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday without the 53 people who had refused to board.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspaper Says Khrushchev Denounced Colleagues in Purges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The late Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was quick to denounce his colleagues as disloyal during the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, a Soviet newspaper reported Sunday. `` We need to destroy those scoundrels,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> as saying at the 1937 conference of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party organization. `` While destroying one, two or 10, we are doing the deed on behalf of millions. `` We should step over the dead bodies of our enemies for the sake of the people.'' The article was based on previously closed archives and written by historian <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>, assistant director of the history institute of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who rose to lead the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1953 to 1964, published his memoirs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but glossed over his role in the purges of his predecessor, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who killed millions of Soviets in consolidating his control. Excerpts from <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s autobiography were published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year The newspaper report indicated that <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> rose by joining in <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s accusations of disloyalty. `` He was part of a new group whose members were more loyal to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> _ who entered the leadership due to their active fight against rightists,'' wrote <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> moved up to <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> party leader, he had words of praise for his successor, A.I. Igarov, the article said. But within months, <PERSON> Igarov </PERSON> was being blamed for mistakes, and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> joined the chorus, according to the report. `` This time <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> spoke of him as an old enemy, hired by Trotskyites and rightists who had been involved in hostile actions in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was a Bolshevik rival who was denounced by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, forced into exile and eventually assassinated in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Thousands of Soviets were put to death on charges of conspiring with <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> against the Soviet leadership. In the early years of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s attacks on his colleagues, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was party chief of a workers' school called Promakademiya. The article said that as soon as <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> took the post in 1930, 40 Communists were hauled before the party leadership to answer questions on their loyalty. The newspaper also said <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was one of the first to accuse <PERSON> Nikolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo in the 1920s who was ousted by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1929. In fact, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> had to retract his early criticism after the party newspaper Pravda published a letter praising <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, the article said. Later, the tide turned against <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and he was executed in 1938.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, a progressive denomination with roots in the earliest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> colonies, is struggling to end a 10-year battle over whether its national offices should leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 703 delegates of the denomination's 17th General Synod hoped to decide Monday whether to combine its national offices _ now scattered in three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> locations _ in a single <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> location or move them to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Synod delegates will also elect a new president on Monday. One of the candidates is a woman who if elected would become the first woman president of a major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Leaders of the 32-year-old, 1.8 million-member denomination expected the synod to handily approve a study committee's recommendation to move the headquarters denomination to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Presbyterian and Lutheran denominations involved in mergers also have moved from the city in recent years. But, after four days of meetings, the synod has become sharply divided over whether the cost savings available in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> are worth losing some ecumenical ties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Those favoring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wear apple stickers on their name tags. Delegates favoring <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> wear a sailboat. `` Most people feel that there are some compelling arguments on either side,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Potterveld </PERSON>, senior minister at <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Potterveld </PERSON> chairs the 33-member committee that for nearly seven hours on Saturday reviewed the earlier committee's study of the issue. His committee set up Monday's decision by endorsing the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> proposal 21-10 with two abstentions. The <ORGANIZATION> UCC </ORGANIZATION>'s last national meeting, in 1987, rejected a recommendation to move the headquarters to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, ordering the formation of a study committee instead. `` People are sick of this,'' the <ORGANIZATION> UCC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Golder </PERSON> said, adding that another deferral is unlikely. The headquarters debate has raged for 10 years, he said, since the denomination was forced by a landlord's decision and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rental market to split its offices. No poll of the full delegation had been taken on the issue. But a proposal already on the synod floor would scrap the committees' recommendation and move two of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> UCC offices to the third office at the <ORGANIZATION> Interchurch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which houses 65 church and other non-profit organizations The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> delegation, more than 70 people, is the synod's largest, and its leaders have lobbied hard for a move to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, particularly among large delegations from nearby states. Critics say a move from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would diminish the <ORGANIZATION> UCC </ORGANIZATION>'s standing in the ecumenical community `` This church has a historic and strong involvement in the ecumenical movement,'' <PERSON> Potterveld </PERSON> said. `` This move will put certain hardships on that. Both committees recognize that. It -LRB- ecumenism -RRB- is part of our heritage and will continue to be part of our future.'' But not all agree the <ORGANIZATION> UCC </ORGANIZATION>'s ecumenical efforts are best served in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and supporters of the move to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> say it would save millions in rent and other costs and bridge a symbolic gap between the national and local church. The nominees for president of the denomination are the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the Rev. <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Delk </PERSON> of Union City, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Delk </PERSON> wins, she would be the first woman president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> or other major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> UCC </ORGANIZATION> is the denomination's senior minister, chief executive and its official representative in ecumenical relations. While the president has no doctrinal or authoritarian power over the denomination's members, the position is widely viewed as an important theological platform. The denomination formed in the 1957 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and the Evangelical and Reformed Church. It is unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, a loosely associated group of conservative churches.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the weekend became the first state to limit the grueling work hours of interns and residents to reduce the risk of error by dazed and exhausted doctors-in-training. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which trains 16 percent of the nation's doctors, is leading a national movement away from the century-old tradition of 36-hour shifts and 100-hour work weeks for postgraduate trainees in medicine. The Health Department now limits shifts to 24 hours and the work week to 80 hours. Several hospitals in the city had already implemented the 24-hour rules, and a medical council is preparing guidelines that will be enforceable nationwide. Long hours have been `` a rite of passage for years and years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachter </PERSON>, chief emergency room resident at <LOCATION> Metropolitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` But there's been an astonishing change in two years.'' Proponents of the tradition say shunning sleep toughens young doctors to the rigors of medicine and lets them study the progression of a patient's illness. Critics say bleary-eyed residents endanger patients _ and can even kill them. `` You come in pretty blind in July and August _ it's no secret the mortality rates are the highest when the interns are brand new. You do n't know what's going on even with an enormous amount of direction,'' said a 33-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> intern who spoke on condition of anonymity. State Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said today's doctors must learn more than their predecessors, make more decisions and treat sicker patients. `` Is it ideal if a resident works 24 hours? No _ but it's a lot better than 36 hours at a time,'' said <PERSON> Sachter </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, backed by the state medical society, have sued to block the regulations, charging they will be too costly. The hospital industry estimates 4,500 to 5,000 workers must be hired statewide to implement the plan. A <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study of hospitals with high mortality rates raised serious questions about the quality of supervision and the dangers posed by resident fatigue. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> appointed a panel to address the issue after the 1984 death of the daughter of author-lawyer <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Zion </PERSON>. <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> <PERSON> Zion </PERSON>, 18, died after going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for treatment of an earache and fever. A grand jury, while indicting no one, found Ms. <PERSON> Zion </PERSON>'s death resulted from inadequate care and errors by unsupervised interns and residents. `` We have a sense that there are problems related to fatigue. But it's harder to attribute a poor decision to fatigue and much easier to determine that supervision was not present,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Faith Schottenfeld. In February, Drs. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novack </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> described fatigue-induced mistakes in a letter to the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. They told of a get-together where residents admitted `` giving the wrong antibiotic, overlooking diagnoses, mistranscribing orders and falling asleep while writing up a history.'' But traditions die hard. When <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, professor at <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, started pressing for reform in 1987, they were `` lambasted and torn apart by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> medical establishment,'' said <PERSON> Sachter </PERSON>. `` Older physicians say: ` I did it _ they're going to do it. ... I think we're coddling these kids,''' <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said in a May speech. `` Our elders do n't recognize that medicine has changed.'' The Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Accreditation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the accreditation body for all teaching hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is about to issue work limits for some specialties and strengthen supervision for all of them. The guidelines will be phased in as each hospital comes up for accreditation over the next three or four years, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinlader </PERSON>, director of residence review committee activities. Critics say hospitals rely on residents for cheap labor. They earn about $ 30,000 a year, which comes to $ 6.25 an hour for a 100-hour week. Costs are a big concern to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospital association, which says two-thirds of the 220 non-profit or public hospitals it represents lost money in 1988. The Health Department has granted hospitals $ 226 million in reimbursements for more staff to take over some jobs previously done by interns and residents. The hospital association says its members need $ 149 million more. As for enforcement of the regulations, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be satisfied for now with a good-faith effort, said <PERSON> Schottenfeld </PERSON>.

 Sometime Monday night or early Tuesday, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merry </PERSON> will retrieve `` Old Nancy'' from her secret hiding place and take her to the town common in <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. There the 1,200-pound, Revolutionary War-era cannon will be fired just twice on Independence Day before ging back in hiding for another year _ a precaution <PERSON> Merry </PERSON> says is necessary to keep the militiamen in neighboring <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> from stealing her. `` We only move her under cover of darkness,'' said <PERSON> Merry </PERSON>, 45, who holds the honorary post of town cannoneer. `` We have to be very careful because of the neighbors. They send spies out once in a while.'' Horsefeathers, replied <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aulson </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION> `` We already have the real <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Aulson </PERSON>, 41. `` If you go down to the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, you'll see her right there _ mounted on a block so the guys from <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> ca n't take her.'' As for <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>'s fat old muzzleloader, <PERSON> Aulson </PERSON> said: `` They put a few firecrackers in it and they make a nice bang, but that does n't make it real. The annual cannon fusillade between <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, in which sarcasm and subterfuge long ago replaced black powder and shot, has been a Fourth of July tradition for more than 100 years. It all started in 1775, when a colonial raider, Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, captured the British frigate <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> off the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> coast and <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>'s militiamen were assigned to guard the ship's cannon In 1839, the town of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, seceded from <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> and ownership of the cannon came in dispute. According to one local legend, the <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> militia hid it in the <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which kept it out of the hands of the upstarts from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION> but somehow ruined its ability to shoot. Another legend has it that a clever <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> carpenter fashioned a fake cannon out of wood in 1877, after `` Old Nancy'' had been stolen back and forth several times. Merry says the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> militia probably had some kind of devilment in mind, such as switching the cannons and making off with the real one, but the plot was foiled when an observant <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> resident noticed that <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION>'s horsedrawn artillery carriage was n't sinking very deep in the mud. `` He just walked over and stuck his jacknife in the barrel of the cannon, and that was the end of that,'' <PERSON> Merry </PERSON> said. Today, both <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> have iron cannon. <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> claims its cannon ca n't be fired because it's the original _ the one that came out of the <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Merry replies that having a non-firing cannon `` is the price you pay for cheap imitations acquired at some <LOCATION> Topsfield </LOCATION> yard sale.'' Both towns are celebrating important anniversaries this year. <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>, which has 3,900 inhabitants, is turning 350. <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, with 5,700 residents, turns 150. Neither side expects the dispute over Old Nancy to be resolved anytime soon. `` I sure hope not,'' said <PERSON> Merry </PERSON>. `` If it did, it would just be an old cannon.''

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s teachers to `` embrace change'' and remember her as having `` chalk dust on the sleeves of her soul'' in an emotional farewell speech Sunday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the 2-million-member union for the past six years, steps down at the end of the summer. A vote on her successor was scheduled Monday at the annual <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> attended by some 8,400 delegates. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> is widely credited with bringing the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> into the thick of education reform and helping it shed an obstructionist image fueled by attacks by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other conservatives in the past decade. In a 17-page speech interrupted more than 60 times by applause, cheers and standing ovations, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> exhorted her members not only to participate in but to lead the education reform movement. `` We need massive, systemwide restructuring, and the plan we follow must be a plan conceived, written and implemented by the educators of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We have the programs. We have the organizational expertise to use our collective bargaining power to impact areas that go far beyond the issue of salary, as critical as that issue is and always will be.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> must continue to say no to `` the voucher salesmen, to the tuition tax credit peddlers, to the elitists, the politically ambitious and the educationally inexperienced _ all those who think they know our business better than we do.'' But she also urged the organization, once labeled `` the status quo incarnate'' by former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, not to stand in the path of worthwhile reforms. `` We must embrace change and reject reaction,'' she said. `` We must continue to expand politically and professionally as we have over the last 20 years, especially the last five years. ... We must push hard, we must take risks, we must never let up.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, resident who has not ruled out an eventual run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, took some parting shots at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and also at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined both a pre-election candidate interview with the group and an invitation to speak this weekend at its meeting. About one-third of the union consists of registered Republicans, according to <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. `` We've had enough of leaders who whittle away at our schools then complain that the foundation of education is crumbling,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said. `` We've had enough of leaders who think education policy is having their picture taken in a first grade class, just in time for the nightly news.'' The departing union chief reiterated <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> calls for full funding of national education, health and nutrition programs for disadvantaged children and dismissed conservative criticism of the group as having a `` cash register mentality.'' `` The bankers do n't apologize for saying they need more -LRB- money -RRB-,'' she said, referring to the savings and loan crisis. `` The generals do n't apologize. And we're not going to apologize either.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> touched on gun control, homelessness, the global economy, negative campaigning and other broad issues in the course of her speech, but ended on a personal note that brought her a lengthy standing ovation. `` I am still <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> the teacher who 20 years ago sat where you are sitting, and I am still a teacher and I always shall be,'' she said. `` So my dear friends, if you remember me, I want you to remember me as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, someone who has chalk dust on the sleeves of her soul.'' The two men vying to succeed <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> are Vice President <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and executive committee member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> is generally considered more moderate and more likely to continue on the course set by <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>.

 More than 200 relatives of people killed when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot down an Iranian airliner a year ago have sued the makers of the ship's radar system, a spokesman said Sunday. <PERSON> Nagib </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghafoor </PERSON> said the suit was filed June 28 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290 victims. The announcement of the lawsuit came on the eve of the July 3 anniversary of the 1988 tragedy, when an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was shot down by the USS Vincennes in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew members said they mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter coming in to attack. The jetliner was on a commercial flight from the Iranian city of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, where a large air base is located, to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghafoor </PERSON> said the lawsuit was filed against the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar equipment on board the USS Vincennes.'' GE is based in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The company has not seen the suit yet, so it's inappropriate to comment,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Batty </PERSON>, a company spokesman. Most of the passengers aboard the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> were Iranians. Pentagon analysts have said split-second decisions aboard the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> were affected by the inability of radar operators to immediately match the plane's radar trace with digital direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another screen. <PERSON> Ghafoor </PERSON> said the complaint charged that the radar equipment indicated the aircraft approaching the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was an F-14, diving in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight, which was climbing. He said claims against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on behalf of the families `` are in the process of being filed as well.'' The Iranian government has been seeking a World Court verdict against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and demanded financial compensation for the 290 dead. He did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government paid the families of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors killed in an Iraqi air strike on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on May 16, 1987. The Iraqis said the ship was hit because the pilot of a Mirage fighter-bomber mistook it for an Iranian warship. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed to pay $ 27.3 million to the families of 37 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crewmen killed aboard the Stark, meaning each family would receive around $ 740,000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had asked for $ 29.6 million for the families, along with an unspecified amount for 21 sailors wounded in the incident.

 Actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, currently in a bitter court fight with ex-lover <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, has kept her `` twisting in the wind'' for money and treats her `` almost like she's the baby sitter,'' his brother says. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, speaking in the July 10 issue of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> were `` foolish in the way they went about having a child.'' The couple has a 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. `` And that led to disaster. I see it as a tragedy,'' said the actor's younger brother. `` In the long run, yes, he took care of them financially,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said. `` But he always kept <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> guessing as to when the payment would come in.

The couple, who split in 1983, were never married but lived together for several years, including a few weeks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which recognizes common-law marriages. The enmity between the pair may be the result of old wounds from those days, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> had been healthier, if he'd shown her more courtesy over the years, then there would n't be such bitterness now He treats her almost like she's the baby sitter,'' he said.

 An unprecedented statewide crackdown by 1,000 officers ended early Sunday with nearly 2,200 people arrested on charges of using or dealing crack. Many suspects were back on the street within hours. Operation Rock Pile also seized more than 3,000 `` rocks'' of the purified form of cocaine, generally sold in pea-sized amounts that are smoked in a pipe. Many suspects were arrested by officers posing as dealers. Others were captured in raids and dramatic foot chases. `` It's gone way above our expectations,'' said <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, coordinator of the sweep. At some points Saturday night, authorities took in suspects at a rate of 100 an hour, with more than a third of the arrests in urban southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. More than 400 arrests took place in the mostly rural western Panhandle. `` It shows that crack is not just an urban problem,'' said <PERSON> Broward </PERSON> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` We arrested people ranging from inner cities to the country, from kids to very mature adults.'' Among those arrested was <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, 59, and her son, O.T. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION>. `` She had 11 grams of cocaine in her underwear,'' said <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>. `` Her son had 3 grams on him.'' The 48-hour effort, described as the largest single anti-drug campaign in the nation, targeted street-level users and dealers, the people who keep the big distributors in business, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman. Many of the suspects were charged with cocaine possession or sale, and then used bail bondsmen to post $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 bail. `` I'm just walking one out right after another,'' said an Orlando-area bondsman who spoke on condition he not be identified. `` For me, -LRB- the drug bust -RRB- is great.'' In <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>'s poor <PERSON> Winwood </PERSON> community, some doubted whether the marathon drug bust would make a difference. `` No way,'' said one dealer, clutching a plastic bag of crack. `` No way is it going to help.'' `` One night wo n't do it. -LRB- But -RRB- if they keep doing what they've been doing, it will help a lot,'' said <PERSON> Althea </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a 33-year-old resident The tactics used in the sweep _ particularly undercover stings _ raised concern with the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` Anytime you have reverse stings, with police used as a lure for drug users, you're entering a very sensitive area,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Charleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carres </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is in favor of battling drugs, but we do n't feel people's rights should be violated in the rush to stop drug traffic.'' Three undercover patrolmen suffered minor injuries in <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after their car was rammed by a vehicle driven by a suspect. In addition to crack, authorities found more than 10 pounds of cocaine and three pounds of other drugs, including heroin and steroids. More than $ 44,300 was confiscated and about 300 cars, a boat and nearly 50 firearms were seized, said <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sheriffs plan more such sweeps. `` Look how much we took in,'' he said. `` It shows these type of operations work.''

 Conservative <PERSON> Tzannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> was sworn in Sunday as premier of a conservative-leftist coalition government formed to end corrupt politics as crowds chanted `` Put the crooks in jail!'' The conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the government Saturday on condition it last only three months and limit its work to `` restoring democratic institutions and cleansing Greek political life.'' About 3,000 people gathered outside the Presidential Palace downtown to applaud the 22 members of the new government as they entered and departed after being sworn in by Orthodox Archbishop <PERSON> Serapheim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. `` Catharsis, catharsis, put the crooks in jail!'' the crowd chanted when <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> appeared. <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> later presided over the government's first Cabinet meeting. He said financial scandals involving the outgoing socialist government would be investigated and that justice would be carried out `` in full and in depth.'' <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> convenes Monday, and under the constitution <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> has 15 days to present his government's program for approval. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s political parties were forced into negotiations to form a coalition government after none won a majority in the 300-seat unicameral parliament in elections June 18. New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of an absolute majority; the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progess won 28 seats and outgoing Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, won 125. A small conservative party and an independent took the other two seats. It was the first time communists have played a role in determining the formation of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s government. Investigating a multimillion-dollar scandal allegedly involving ministers in <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s government will be the focus of the new government's work. That scandal, and the 70-year-old <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s open affair with a woman half his age while he was married, contributed to his downfall. He has been hospitalized with a heart and kidney condition.

 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled spiritual and political leader, arrives Monday to conduct a three-day teaching ceremony as part of a Western tour promoting peace and human rights. The Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> leader, who fled <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers in his homeland three decades ago, is using the international outcry over the bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to refocus attention on repressive Chinese rule in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Tibetan exiles say 800 people have been killed in their homeland since the Chinese imposed martial law and moved against independence demonstrators March 5. Official reports of deaths have been much smaller. The protests began a few days before the 30th anniversary of a failed uprising in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, spiritual and temporal ruler of the Tibetans since he was 15, fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on March 31, 1959, three weeks after the uprising began when Chinese troops launched a bloody attack. He set up his headquarters and a government-in-exile in the northern Indian city of <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION>. The 55-year-old <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> was scheduled to arrive Monday night after holding interfaith services in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and taking part in a peace conference with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the Nobel laureate and architect of a peace plan for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He leaves July 20 for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to accept a human rights award. He will conduct an intricate ceremony known as the Kalachakra initiation, or Wheel of Time, for at least 3,000 Buddhists in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. Also scheduled for his visit to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ home to 200,000 of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' estimated 2.5 million Buddhists _ is a speech on peace open to the general public. The lama, known for his wide knowledge of the world's religions and politics, will meet the news media Friday, give a public speech Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium downtown and hold teaching sessions July 10 through July 13 at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> Civic Auditorium. The auditorium also will be the site of the sacred Wheel of Time ceremony, conducted only a few times in the West. A lama dance will be performed July 15. The ceremony itself will run for several hours a day July 16 through July 18, and a `` long life'' initiation will take place July 19. The Dalai Lama will be aided by 18 monks. Some 3,000 of the auditorium's 4,000 seats had been reserved by Friday, at a registration fee of $ 150, said trip spokeswoman <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The ceremony, intended to help believers along the path to enlightenment, centers on creation of a mandala, a painting crafted from colored sand, representing <PERSON> Kalachakra </PERSON>, a four-faced god with 24 arms who subdues violence. Laid out in concentric circles, the painting includes Sanskrit characters, flowers, animals and 722 symbols for <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> deities in a many-chambered palace. A separate group of monks will create a duplicate mandala at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Museum of Natural History from July 6 through Aug. 17. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says it has ruled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> for more than seven centuries. Many Tibetans say they actually were independent for much of that time, ruled by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> theocracy headed by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>.

 A student involved in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crushed democracy movement looked out over <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Sunday and mourned what he said was the death of his generation's campaign for a freer society. `` It was as if I could see all the people, all the tents again before my own eyes,'' he said with a wistful smile, four weeks to the day after soldiers and tanks wrested the square from pro-democracy student activists. `` It used to be so lively, brimming with energy, people marching here, listening to speeches there, singing over there,'' he said after gazing over the immaculate _ and empty _ square from the rostrum of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. `` It feels as though I've died and come back again.'' It was four Sundays ago that the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> blasted through hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians and flattened the tent city that had sprung up on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, the heart of the movement for democratic reforms. Martial law authorities opened the Gate and two parks adjacent to it to tourists Saturday to mark the 68th anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Only a few dozen soldiers with automatic rifles ringed the 100-acre square Sunday afternoon. The square was scrubbed clean of all traces of the hundreds of thousands who crossed it during the popular uprising. The student, one of three representatives from his school who took part in meetings of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, studies social sciences at a well-known college in the Chinese capital. He did not want his name used. He spent many nights in a sleeping bag and then a makeshift tent on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> after students began their occupation of it May 13. Now he says he and fellow students are still reeling from the violence of June 3-4. The government says up to 300 died, but Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say up to 3,000 lost their lives. `` My classmates who took part in the movement _ writing posters, marching at school, chanting slogans _ were completely stunned by the outcome,'' he said. Some, he said, are quietly accepting the government line that troops were needed to quell the `` counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' because they want to join the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to further their careers. `` If a man and woman are equally qualified for a job, work units will want the man, but if the woman is a party member, they'll want her,'' he said. `` It means the person was good in school, is in good health, has the right thoughts and is likely to move ahead in the world.'' The student said he had been planning to apply for party membership this year but scrapped the idea after the crackdown. `` I can criticize the student movement, given that the results were hardly what we wanted. But I ca n't bring myself to trample people underfoot. That's what you have to do to be a party member these days,'' he said. During the protests, which began in mid-April, `` I thought it was something we must do,'' he said. `` But the result was something that should never ever have happened. I have n't been able to reconcile this with myself yet. `` We did n't think enough. We were very optimistic. We were making noise, being heard, we thought we were adding a little democracy to our system. Now, people have died.'' He thinks the crackdown has beaten student voices into silence, at least for a few years. `` The warm spirit of the students has been crushed, they have no political energy,'' he said, his eyes downcast. `` If anyone continues this movement it will be after <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> dies, and it wo n't be my generation of students.''

 A suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> car bomb exploded on a British military base Sunday evening, killing a soldier and injuring his wife and three children, officials said. The bomb went off as the man opened the door of the car and his family waited to get in, police said. The attack, in a housing area on the base, was the second in two weeks on a British installation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials said bomb disposal experts found another explosive device in the area and defused it. Residents in nearby apartment buildings were evacuated and police searched for other bombs. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but officials suspected the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` The indications are that this is the kind of attack that can be attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>. Squadron Leader <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the British military in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said the explosion `` occurred in a married living quarters area. `` We also understand that three children and a woman were taken to hospital with injuries,'' she said. <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> police said the injured were the man's wife and three children and that they were were slightly injured in the blast. The names of the victims were not immediately released. Police and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials believed the soldier owned the car. On June 19, a bomb ripped through the living quarters at a British military barracks near <LOCATION> Osnabrueck </LOCATION>. No one was injured in the blast, but police suspect the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for the attack. On June 14, West German prosecutors indicted two suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members on attempted murder charges in 1987 and 1988 bombing attacks aimed at the British military that wounded 46 people, most of them West Germans. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has attacked British troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in its campaign to force the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the mostly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Church Holds Service Despite Order To Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parishioners at a Roman Catholic church held a prayer service Sunday, a week after the church was ordered to close, but an Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> spokesman said the action was understandable. About 50 members of Mother of <ORGANIZATION> Consolation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> held a 45-minute prayer service, said <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidarini </PERSON>, president of the parish council. It was not a formal Mass. `` There's no problem with that,'' said archdiocese spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` I'm presuming it was something of a spiritual farewell by the people who participated.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said he did n't know whether any other churches already ordered closed or merged held similar services Sunday. Seven of the 30 targeted parishes closed Friday and two more closed Saturday, raising the number closed or merged to 25, the archdiocese said last week. On Friday, attorneys representing 17 of the 30 churches filed a motion to block the closings with the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The court said it would consider the motion no earlier than Wednesday. Earlier in the week, <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> denied a request to block some of the closings, saying civil courts had no jurisdiction over internal church policy. Appeals to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to overrule Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>, who ordered the closings and mergers last fall, also have been rejected. The church cites declining membership, a shortage of priests and the costs of maintaining the large churches. At least one of the churches have already been sold to a Protestant congregation. <PERSON> Guidarini </PERSON> said he believed church members would comply with a court decision upholding the archdiocese's order. `` We'll talk, but if the appeals court rules against the people, we probably will surrender the key,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worshipped at an oceanside church Sunday, jogged, and planned to play tennis and fish as he continued to enjoy `` fun stuff'' during a five-day Fourth of July vacation. He also planned to treat neighbors to a gala fireworks display from his family compound on Monday. Although the focus remained on relaxation, aides said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was studying briefing materials for next week's trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. And the vacation White House, like many others in the country, was eagerly awaiting Monday's expected <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> abortion decision. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would react to the decision _ whichever way it goes _ early Monday afternoon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who supported a woman's right to chose an abortion when he first ran for president in 1980, more recently has favored a constitutional amendment to outlaw the procedure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day with a 6:30 a.m. 20-minute jog along back roads near his six-acre estate on a point jutting out into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Later, he attended services at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which also enjoys a waterfront location. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and other members of his family occupied a front pew. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped his ailing 87-year-old mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, down the aisle and into her seat. The older Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is recovering from a mild stroke she suffered in the spring. After church, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plunged into a crowd of several hundred onlookers who had gathered outside the church, shaking hands and wishing people well. `` I hope we get out there on the water, do some fun stuff,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told one person in the crowd. The crowd of about 200 broke into applause as the first family emerged from the sanctuary. During the service, the Rev. <PERSON> Laman </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> declared that the small summer-only congregation had been `` strengthened by the prayers and presence of President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and their family.'' After church services, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played tennis and swam at <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point He then boarded his boat Fidelity with wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and motored to nearby <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Porpoise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to pick up some lunch for their fishing excursion on the water. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eased his speeedboat into the dock below <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON>'s Shanty, where a patio full of luncheon diners crowded to the railing to see him get the food from <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON>'s. Asked what he picked up, the president said, `` Clams and chowder.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in white slacks, visor cap and white pullover with small <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, waved to the dockside crowd, which included a band of reporters and camera crews and called out to one sunburned person, `` Put on your suntan lotion immediately.'' The president, in khaki pants and faded red knit shirt, waved amiably before steering the boat back through the crowd of fishing boats anchored in the cove. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> took some pains to keep the <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON>'s excursion a secret so as not to attract large crowds. Two vans of pool reporters and camera crews who accompany the president on public excursions were driven into a secluded driveway at the edge of <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON>'s parking lot so they would not tip off the arrival. But residents there said they had heard from the next-door neighbors that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was coming. A hand-lettered sign hung from the dock read, `` <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON>'s welcomes you, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Employees said it was put up for the weekend visit and they only found out he was actually coming that morning. On Monday evening, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family was to sponsor a 15-minute fireworks display to be set off from the grounds of the president's 26-room seacoast home The setting off of Independence Day fireworks has become a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family tradition in recent years. Because an anonymous donor upped the firepower for the display to some two tons of rockets and other explosive displays, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fireworks were moved up to Monday night so as to not compete with town fireworks scheduled for the Fourth of July. The show will be produced by pyrotechnics specialist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambelli </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Authorities worked Sunday to locate relatives of the last victim to be identified among the four people killed when an explosion and fire tore through the midsection of a 10-story office building. Investigators said Sunday that the woman, in her early 30s, was identified Saturday night by her boss as a secretary for D.A.M.S. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a construction consulting company. Her name was withheld until her family could be notified. A total of 23 people were injured in Friday's blaze. As of Sunday, nine remained hospitalized with two in serious condition, including a woman who leaped from a sixth-floor window and broke her legs and an ankle whose condition earlier had been critical. A series of powerful electrical explosions apparently set off when an electrical worker was changing a fuse triggered the blaze Friday. Much of the building was evacuated quickly, but a number of workers were trapped and broke out windows to escape choking plumes of smoke. Fire officials focused their investigation Saturday on whether extensive electrical work being done in the building played a role in the fire and whether some of that work violated city codes. Acting Fire Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said those who died could have been saved had a sprinkler system been installed in the 10-story building, which was built in 1962, before city codes required sprinklers in buildings more than eight stories tall. The building is managed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Komsky </PERSON>, vice president of the company, said Saturday that an investigation would begin into the fire He would not comment on the lack of sprinklers.

<TEXT>
 An ancient Spanish sword found on a farm in northwestern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> belongs to the three artifact hunters who dug it up, not the owner of the farm because he waited too long to claim it, a judge has ruled. <ORGANIZATION> Floyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON> ordered that the sword be returned to the three men who dug it up on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>'s land on the <LOCATION> Coosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1982, without <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>'s knowledge or permission Studies indicate the sword was taken to a Coosa Indian village at the site during the Spanish explorations of <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> in 1540 or during a later Spanish expedition in 1560. The village was attacked in the mid-16th century, and many of the people were killed by metal weapons. Research indicates the sword was made in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> between 1520 and 1540, and it is an important link establishing that Spaniards came through <LOCATION> Floyd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the 16th century, <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be a shame if goes somewhere else,'' he said. According to the court order filed Friday, <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> waited too long before claiming the sword, which had been loaned to the state-run Etowah Mounds Archaeological Museum. He did not claim ownership until 1987, after a four-year statute of limitations had run out. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said Sunday he did not try to get the sword, known as `` De <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>'s sword,'' back sooner because <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> archaeologists assured him they were pursuing ownership for the state. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said he first learned of its existence in 1983, when university archaeologists called him to say the sword that had been loaned for five years to the Etowah Mounds museum had come from his farm. He said it was taken without his knowledge by `` pot hunters,'' who often enter the dig site. He eventually learned that he had to file a claim in order to keep the sword from going to the finders, but it was too late, he said. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said he will appeal, adding, `` they admitted themselves they took it from my place.'' One of the finders, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Itson </PERSON> of Cave Spring, said he is pleased with <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON>'s decision. `` I do feel it belongs to us,'' <PERSON> Itson </PERSON> said. `` It was just a real lucky find _ we were n't trying to steal it.'' He said he and the other two are seeking a permanent home for the sword.

 Three barricaded nuns who fled their <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> monastery after a nearly nine-month standoff are in hiding, but will continue their protest against liberalizations of their order, a relative said Sunday. One of the Carmelite nuns remained locked in the monastery's infirmary on Sunday, refusing to leave `` They're not giving up,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ercolano </PERSON>, mother of Sister <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, one of those who abandoned the monastery early Saturday morning. `` They left because they want to protect their vows,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ercolano </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Sunday from her home in <LOCATION> Castleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` They plan on keeping their appeal going as long as it takes to set things straight.'' The four nuns had been barricaded in the infirmary of the Monastery of the Most Blessed <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carmel </ORGANIZATION> since Oct. 4, when their protest shattered the calm behind the building's white-stone walls and drew international attention The Carmelite order teaches solitude and prayer with a strict adherence to separation from the outside world. The rebel nuns have said they took refuge in the infirmary because they feared eviction by their mother superior, <PERSON> Prioress </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, for speaking out against liberalizations she introduced such as television and sweets. During the first days of the protest, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> held news conferences from behind iron bars, denouncing the unruly members of her flock for `` attempted anarchy.'' Repeated calls to her telephone number Sunday got only a busy signal. The separation took its emotional and physical toll on the protesters, Ms. <PERSON> Ercolano </PERSON> said, and led them to leave the infirmary for more comfortable surroundings while the fight continues. She refused to say where her daughter and the other nuns have gone. `` They're getting fresh air, and for once, they're getting some peace and quiet,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ercolano </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want to be bothered. They just want the case to go forward.'' The nuns have said they have an appeal before the Apostolica Signatura, the highest court at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Lower arms of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> have twice ordered the nuns to end the protest, but they refused and promised to continue protesting until hearing from the Apostolica Signatura. <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said the diocese was to serve them notice Monday that if they did not leave, proceedings would begin to remove them from the order. `` That needs to be re-evaluated before the diocese decides the next move,'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. `` There are regulations within the order forbidding the nuns to leave the monastery for any reason with very few exceptions, and those regulations will have to be reviewed too.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a lay person who has served as a spokeswoman for the nuns, said she did not know they were leaving or where they are. `` I've noticed a change in their attitude in the last month, as if somebody was in contact with them who they've been listening to,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. The nuns had been questioning their own tactics in the past few weeks, after adamantly believing they were doing the right thing, Mrs. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. They thought their protest remained valid even when a letter from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ordered them out of the infirmary, she said. Five nuns began the protest in October: Sisters <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Philomena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON>. Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, returned to her Hillside home in March citing health reasons. Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON> remained in the infirmary. Ms. <PERSON> Ercolano </PERSON> said Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON> did not think the nuns should have left because she felt the monastery was their home. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said he did not know what would happen with Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON>. That would be part of a review set for Monday, he said.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Sunday he has directed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to compile a list of federal prisoners convicted of burning the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in anticipation that they will be freed under a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` If some one is entitled to relief, then all are entitled to relief,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, referring to the court's 5-4 decision in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case, in which the court said flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of political protest. However, he said he doubted that more than `` a handful'' of federal prisoners are involved. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> made the comments on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' in response to a question about <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza-Lugo </PERSON>, a Puerto Rican nationalist now at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mendoza-Lugo </PERSON>, who was given a one-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to a federal charge of flag desecration, last week filed a petition in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court for his release. `` My expectation is that he probably will be entitled to that relief,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Mendoza-Lugo </LOCATION>, who burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag two years ago in front of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> as a protest for Puerto Rican independence. `` The court's striking down the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute in all likelihood would encompass the federal statute that was passed at the time of the flag-burning demonstrations during the Vietnam War,'' the attorney general said.

 An 11-year-old Californian flying around the world touched down on Sunday in <LOCATION> Kuibyshev </LOCATION>, a city that foreigners have been forbidden to enter for more than four decades, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Kuibyshev, which lies on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 450 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is one of many Soviet cities closed to foreigners because defense-related industries are located there. `` We would be happy if our visit to your city opened the doors for all foreigners,'' the pilot's father, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON>, was quoted as saying by the Soviet news agency. The elder <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> is accompanying his son, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, aboard the Cessna 210. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kuibyshev </PERSON> has been closed `` since World War II, when defense industries were evacuated there'' from the Western part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which was then under Nazi German occupation. `` For the last 60 years, only one foreign aircraft has landed in this region without special permission,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That was a fascist bomber ... which in October 1942 tried to destroy a strategic bridge across the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION>. It was shot down.'' The area may be opened to foreigners because many of its defense industries are being converted to the production of civilian goods, such as furniture, sporting equipment and disposable syringes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Soviet reporters in <LOCATION> Kuibyshev </LOCATION> asked the young aviator, a resident of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, his impressions of the winding <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION>. `` It is very beautiful, like the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> began learning to fly at the age of 4 and became the youngest person to solo by flying an ultralight aircraft at age 9 on March 13, 1988. This 47-day, 19,000-mile flight, dubbed Friendship Flight'89, began June 5. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> had hoped to meet Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during a three-day stop in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but he was told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was too busy.

 A mother who claimed abductors took her two baby daughters in nearly identical incidents years apart faces a court hearing Monday into charges that she concealed the second infant's death. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 29, also faces similar charges in the 1986 death of her first daughter, although no murder charges in either case have been filed, authorities said. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, arrested Saturday, was being held in lieu of $ 250,000 bond in the Madison County Jail, accused of obstruction of justice and concealing a homicide in the April death of her 6-week-old daughter, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, reported <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> abducted on April 29 from their home in this southwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city. Her body was found in a trash can across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> several days later. In 1986, the couple's firstborn daughter, 13-day-old <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>, was reported missing under similar circumstances from their previous home in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was charged in May with concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in that case. She pleaded innocent, and her trial is set for July 18. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was arrested at her parents' home Saturday evening in the <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> case, said <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wein </PERSON>. Her attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Groshong </PERSON>, could not be reached for comment. A woman who answered his home phone Sunday said he would not be available until Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' father also refused to talk Sunday about the latest charges filed against her. `` There wo n't be any information released on the investigation,'' said <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> police Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. State's Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haine </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police are moving carefully in their investigation of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s death and that no charges would be brought until police had a strong case. Police have said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> told them he believes his wife may have killed their daughters accidently. Witnesses have said Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> wanted to give birth to sons, and was unhappy with daughters. On June 17, 1986, the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> told police that a masked gunman broke into their home in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> and abducted <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION>. The decomposed remains of a baby believed to be <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION> were found several days later near the couple's home in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, a rural <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> refused to answer questions before a grand jury that considered the case in 1987, citing their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. The panel took no action. But an investigation into the death of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> uncovered new evidence in the first case. A <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury returned an indictment May 12. Police have said previously that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> is a suspect in both deaths, but he has not been charged. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> for comment were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' father, Troy, reached by telephone, said he did not know where his son was.

 Police and troops on Sunday ringed a village where 11 people were reported killed in a riot triggered by citizen protests over being forced to become part of the black homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. Residents of the homeland town of <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION> said as many as 2,000 people had been rounded up in a police dragnet. A private civil rights group said some were being beaten and stoned by police seeking vengeance for the clash Saturday between security forces and residents. The reports could not be confirmed. Witnesses said the riot erupted after security forces moved in to break up an `` illegal'' gathering at a local sports field in the village of <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION>, 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, and opened fire without warning, killing two people and wounding several others. They said an angry mob then attacked a government armored vehicle, setting it afire with gasoline bombs. Four of the nine officers inside burned to death and five others were killed with axes and rocks as they tried to escape, the witnesses said. Police confirmed that two people were killed by gunfire but said the nine officers were the victims of an `` unprovoked attack.'' Although they were described as police, the type of vehicle involved is normally used by the army forces there. Police and military roadblocks were set up around <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION>, a town of about 15,000 that was incorporated Dec. 31 into the tribal homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> over the objections of most of its inhabitants. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> is one of nearly a dozen black homelands within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the government considers nominally independent. The homelands are not recognized internationally as separate countries, and critics say such boundary changes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have deprived thousands of people of South African citizenship and the job opportunities that go with it. The homeland system in effect helps <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black population, now at 28 million. The 5 million whites control the economy and dominate the government. Officers were searching for weapons, ammunition and other equipment taken from security forces during the turmoil, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> said. Journalists were allowed into the sports field where scorched ground and bloody rocks were visible, but saw none of the detainees that villagers claimed had been rounded up by police in a sweep that lasted well into Sunday. Observers said the figure of 2,000 arrested was probably exaggerated. Mrs. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Yawitch </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- TRAC -RRB-, a private organization, said `` quite a lot'' of people had been detained but could not give any figures. The South African Press Association quoted her as saying some of those held were `` gathered into an open space and stoned and beaten by the police,'' but did not know if anyone had been killed. Many other people were said by local residents to have fled into the thick bush around <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION>, some of them making their way across the ill-defined boundaries to refuge in nearby South African black townships. Independent witnesses also confirmed that South African police, using powerful Casspir armored vehicles, were taking part in the post-riot dragnet. The South African Press Association earlier quoted a police spokesman, Lt. R.W. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, as denying <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that South African police were operating in the territory. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, actually seven separate parcels of territory in the north-central part of the country, has an estimated population of 1.7 million. Some residents of <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION> have asked South African courts to overturn a 1988 government edict that added their town of 15,000 people and neighboring <LOCATION> Braklaagte </LOCATION>, with 9,000 people, to <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Braklaagte </PERSON> citizens earlier lost a legal appeal, and in March, police there were accused of beating people who refused to declare themselves citizens of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>.

 American pianist <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>, who warmed the hearts of Soviet music lovers in the midst of the Cold War, on Sunday repeated the spectacular performance of the piano concerto that launched his career 31 years ago. With roses from the audience at his feet, <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> drew bravos and even screams Sunday night at <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> as he performed <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, joined in the standing ovation and later expressed their enjoyment privately in a 35-minute meeting backstage with the towering 54-year-old Texan and his 92-year-old mother. `` He played like a god,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> critic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardoin </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to review the performance. `` I do n't see how anyone under this pressure and much emotion could play like he did.'' Before playing, <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> told the 1,500 people packed into the oval hall, `` For 31 years, I have felt like I had two homes. I will soon be asking permission from your distinguished President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to buy an apartment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. I will be coming for much-needed visits for my music, for my soul, to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife laughed even before the request for an apartment in housing-short <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was translated into Russian. But <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> protested, `` Mr. President, I was serious!'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said after his meeting with the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> that the Soviet leader told him he would help arrange the apartment. Sunday was <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s third performance in 11 years. He came out of retirement to play for the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> at the White House in 1987. He will play Monday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION>, on the same stage where he triumphed in 1958. During applause for the <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> concerto, many in the hall were briefly stunned when a television light next to the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>' box exploded The Soviet president calmly leaned out, looked at the smoking light stand and resumed clapping. As is typical in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the concert hall had no air conditioning and the heat was oppressive. Enthusiastic fans crowded the aisles while hundreds more waited outside for a glimpse of <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>. The pianist, his waves of hair perfectly coifed despite the heat, also played <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat Major, a Debussy prelude and the Schumann-Liszt Widmung. One of those in the audience was <PERSON> Nake </PERSON> <PERSON> Flock </PERSON>, who said she heard <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> play in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1958, when he won the Tchaikovsky Competition for young pianists with his performance of the Tchaikaovsky concerto. Ms. <PERSON> Flock </PERSON> said she flew to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from her home in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and paid $ 46.50 for a concert ticket that had a face value of $ 3.41. `` His technique has n't changed,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Flock </PERSON>, the mother of a piano student at the <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION>. `` But he has become more impulsive, more sentimental.'' Some 20 players in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Philharmonic Orchestra backing him were members of the same ensemble 31 years ago that accompanied him on the night he won the <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION>. The Gorbachevs toasted <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> with tea, apple pie and red wine, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who was one of a handful of people allowed into the meeting.

 <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, celebrated in stone on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> 50 years ago, should be celebrated today for his environmental spirit, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Sunday. `` We're not here just to talk about stewardship of our natural resources. ... We're here to act,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> told an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people who turned out to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the unveiling of <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>'s face on the monument. As the audience sang along with a military band that played `` God <LOCATION> Bless </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a song introduced at the original dedication of <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>'s chiseled face 50 years ago, a 90-by-45-foot <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag that had been hung on the mountain was drawn back to reveal the sculpture once again. When sculptor <PERSON> Gutzon </PERSON> <PERSON> Borglum </PERSON> decided <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>'s features would be carved next to the 60-foot-tall faces of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, many people wondered if <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> really belonged with the other presidents on the granite mountain. But <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and other speakers said <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was a good choice for the huge sculpture known as the <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> because he was a president for the common person and a leader in the conservation movement. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration is dedicated to protecting the environment by reducing acid rain, reversing damage to the ozone layer, restoring wetland nesting areas for waterfowl and protecting endangered species. The administration will work to promote the nation's economic growth, but not at the expense of the environment, said the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary, who played key roles in environmental legislation during two decades in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Make no mistake about it: Our commitment to conserving our natural resources ... will never be sacrificed to corporate profit,'' he said. The huge red, white and blue flag was not placed in front of the sculpture as scheduled at dawn because of wind gusting to 35 mph. A crew of workers on the mountain raised the 300-pound banner for the first time at mid-morning, quickly lowering it because the wind was too strong, threatening their safety and the flag itself. The program stayed on schedule as winds dropped and work crews hoisted the flag into position during the speeches, which were given in the ampitheater at the base of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said it was fitting that <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was honored on the mountain because he traveled extensively in the territory that would become the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> several decades before becoming president in 1901. Roosevelt first arrived in the 1880s to hunt and buy ranch land in the area that later became <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said. The governor said <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s travels in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> led to his later efforts to conserve the nation's resources and to place more than 100 million acres of forest land into the public trust. `` He knew that somehow, the hills and forests we love so much must be protected for future generations,'' <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said.

 Sinhalese extremists Sunday stormed a crowded festival attended by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and key Cabinet members and set off a bomb that killed at least two people, police said. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and the Cabinet ministers were in a secret well-guarded location and were unharmed, authorities said. Thirty people were injured, many critically. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred shortly after midnight Saturday near <LOCATION> Mahiyangana </LOCATION>, about 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Police blamed the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes tactics used by the government to end the insurgency by Tamil rebels Police would not say if the attack was aimed at anyone in particular. `` It could have been at anybody. We do n't know,'' said one police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. Elsewhere, authorities said security forces arrested 3,237 youths suspected of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. It was the single largest crackdown against the group in nearly two years. Also Sunday, 18 people were reported killed by Sinhalese hit squads in central and northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, contend they are discriminated against in jobs and education. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. According to police in <LOCATION> Mahiyangana </LOCATION>, several armed youths entered the grounds where 200,000 to 300,000 people gathered for the 11th Annual Village Reawakening Festival, and they exploded a bomb near the main stage. The 10-day festival is aimed at encouraging people to build better houses for themselves and to repair their rundown villages. The attack, the first on such a festival, came despite increased security, including the posting of a large number of military commands around the grounds. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been blamed for more than 3,500 killings since July 1987, when Indian peacekeeping forces arrived on this troubled island to enforce a peace accord between the Sinhalese-dominated government and militant Tamils, who have been fighting for a separate homeland since 1983. The front contends the accord grants too many concessions to the minority Tamils, and it says the presence of Indian soldiers threatens <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. Front members have vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the ethnic problems of the nation because its own 60 million Tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause. In addition to the bombing, police blamed Sinhalese extremists for the deaths of seven moderate Sinhalese in <LOCATION> Kurunegala </LOCATION>, about 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and for seven other deaths in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Officers also said they found four Sinhalese youths shot to death in the town of <LOCATION> Kegalle </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Armed with automatic weapons and empowered by tough emergency laws, soldiers and police raided homes and arrested 3,200 suspected radicals in the Sinhalese-dominated south, officials said. Armed troops also forced open a hostel in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and arrested 37 medical interns who allegedly belong to the front. The weekend newspaper Sun claimed the medical facullty of <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has been the vangaurd of the front's anti-government campaign.

 A <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> forest fire that burned two homes and forced evacuation of a small town spread uncontained Sunday, but <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firefighters neared full control of a 7,840-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a fire that burned 3 acres in Sequoia National Park and 200 adjacent acres of federal wildlands in the Three Rivers area of <LOCATION> Tulare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was controlled Sunday. The park's giant trees were not threatened, officials said Crews fought two out-of-control fires in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> firefighters battling a 960-acre fire that burned two houses and forced evacuation of a small community in the <LOCATION> Glade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area near <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> faced unseasonably warm weather Sunday, with highs in the 90s. Officials were prepared for more blazes in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s tinder-dry high country over the long Fourth of July weekend. But other fires that had broken out since Wednesday were reported contained or near containment. The fire in the <LOCATION> Glade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area broke out Saturday and threatened several more buildings Sunday, said <PERSON> Kelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in Grand Junction. From 25 to 50 residents were evacuated and remained out of their homes Sunday morning. Officials said many of Glade Park's houses are summer homes, and it was uncertain how many people were there Saturday to be evacuated. No injuries were reported. `` They are making real good headway on putting the fire in containment,'' <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> said Sunday morning, when the fire was `` calm and inactive.'' <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> said 230 firefighters were at the scene Sunday, plus three bulldozers, 15 fire engines, two helicopters and two air tankers. The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Several of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> fires were blamed on lightning, but a 5-acre blaze on private land Saturday near the <ORGANIZATION> Pike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was attributed to fireworks, officials said. It was extinguished within two hours,. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s big <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire began Tuesday and burned 12 homes and vacation cabins. Lost watershed and structures were valued at $ 1.1 million and officials estimated firefighting costs at $ 1.9 million. The cause remained under investigation. Improved weather _ lighter wind and higher humidity _ allowed progress against the blaze, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> said many of the 2,300 firefighters had been sent home. The Ortega Highway, linking inland <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elsinore </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coast, remained closed as a safety measure. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> firefighters also were hampered by searing heat and extremely low humidity. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, public information officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Uintah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the Rough Canyon fire 23 miles west of <LOCATION> Duchesne </LOCATION> and another 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Vernal </LOCATION> continued to burn out of control, although containment was estimated for the former on Tuesday. The Rough Canyon fire, which was fought by two helicopters and 133 firefighters, consumed 275 acres of mostly <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land. The other fire burned some 350 acres of sagebrush, pinion juniper and grass.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Condemn U.S., Urge Strikes By Israeli Arabs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with 12 wounded, report on authorization
to use plastic bullets against masked Arabs, details on leaflet.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Underground leaders of the Palestinian revolt on Sunday condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict as `` biased toward the Zionist enemy'' and called for a strike by the 810,000 Arabs within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 12-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed in a clash between troops and stone-throwing Arabs. Twelve Arabs were reported wounded in other incidents. The death raised to 539 the number of Palestinians killed in the 18-month revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Twenty-three Israelis also have died. In another development, a report on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio's English service said Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told Sunday's Cabinet meeting that `` the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had authorized the use of plastic bullets against any Arab male in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories whose face was masked.'' The report did not elaborate and it was not carried on any subsequent <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio broadcasts Sunday night. An official in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, would neither confirm nor deny the report, but he said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> last month to liberalize orders to open fire. The official said the military asked permission to shoot the masked leaders of violent demonstrations with sometimes lethal plastic-tipped bullets `` under very, very, special circumstances.'' He did not specify the circumstances. If the measures were approved in principle by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the ministry would then decide under what conditions the military could open fire and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would then issue new orders, the spokesman said. An army spokesman said no such orders have been issued. Under current regulations, soldiers may only open fire at Palestinians who are building roadblocks or preparing to attack soldiers or if their lives are in danger, the army spokesman said. Many Palestinian protesters mask their faces in Arab keffiyehs, or headdresses. The Palestinian condemnation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came in a leaflet by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. It noted `` the deteriorating economic situation'' in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and called for a further boycott of Israeli products. For the first time, uprising leaders called for a two-day strike among the 810,000 Israeli Arabs and urged them to `` provide material aid and food'' to their brethren in the occupied lands. Radical Palestinian groups have recently increased their efforts aimed at inciting Israeli Arabs, who live among the 3.5 million Jews, to take a more active role in the uprising. Some Israeli Arabs have staged sympathy strikes. The leaflet criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position as `` always biased toward the Zionist enemy and supportive of the elections under occupation,'' and it praised <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries for supporting a U.N.-sponsored peace conference with the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The leaflet came as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reportedly reassured Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of his support for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s peace plan, which calls for balloting in the occupied territories and negotiations with elected Palestinians on limited self-rule. Uprising leaders reject the plan because it does not call for an independent Palestinian state. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the backing came in a letter, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, said the letter had not been received The daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was angry over <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s support for building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, which run counter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy calling for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up land in exchange for peace <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying `` I do n't understand this Shamir'' as he banged his palm on a table at a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The paper said the session was attended by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoyue </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations. The fatal clash Sunday broke out when troops `` encountered violent resistance'' as they entered the village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION> to arrest suspects, an army spokesman said. He said the army was investigating the circumstances of the youth's death. The victim, identified as <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabran </PERSON>, was shot in the chest, said officials at <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. Twelve Palestinians were wounded Sunday by army gunfire, including a 24-year-old woman listed in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman confirmed two of the wounded. About 30 Israeli mayors chained themselves outside <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office Sunday to protest unemployment, which has reached 8.6 percent

 Civil rights leaders commemorated the day their movement became law Sunday by praying at the crypt of <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION> and challenging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to live up to his stated commitment to their cause. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has got to get up and make the White House the right house,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not enough to talk that talk. We need him to walk that walk.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> was marking the 25th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public facilities and has been used in court actions against discrimination in the workplace. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, one of several civil rights leaders who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Friday, said recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions against affirmative action programs have left black leaders doubting that the president would work to protect progress made under the law. `` I'm going to remain hopeful for the time being,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has good instincts. He wants to do what's right in this regard.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reauthorize the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is set to expire Nov. 30. But earlier last week, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would not push <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said civil rights leaders are concerned that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest statements might be just rhetoric, and added that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` gon na have to make up his mind'' on either bolstering black membership in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> or pleasing ultra-conservatives. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> was joined at King's gravesite by <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, whose refusal to sit in a segregated section of a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, bus in 1955 sparked the civil rights movement. Mrs. Parks said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements `` sounded good, but we are waiting for real, real action.'' `` We can not lull ourselves to sleep with words,'' she said. About 200 people gathered for the prayer service, during which <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> blasted <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> for her position against affirmative action. `` Glory be to God, if it were n't for affirmative action she'd still be in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> presiding over a microwave,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said, adding that the American public should `` remind <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> who she is. `` We bled too profusely and died too young to let any <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turn us around,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said.

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> clung to life in a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospital Sunday, and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> said that made her 60th birthday happy. `` I would like to thank <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> for the best birthday present he has ever given me _ his life,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lady </ORGANIZATION> said after a Roman Catholic Mass at the couple's home-in-exile here. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for 20 years before being ousted in February 1986, remained in critical condition Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he has been hospitalized since January. The exiled ruler has suffered massive organ failure, is battling a widespread infection and is being kept alive by machines. `` I know he survived all of this because God has blessed us with a miracle,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. After the Mass, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> read the inscription in a book her husband of 35 years gave her last October, shortly before the couple was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for allegedly stealing more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury and stashing it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wrote the book to chronicle his version of the events that led to his downfall. In the inscription, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> promised not to try to regain power if allowed home. Asked later whether Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> read the inscription as a message to Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has steadfastly refused to let the Marcoses come home, she replied, `` It's a message to all of humanity ... of everyone's right to freedom.'' But she admitted she was not optimistic that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stole billions of dollars during his rule, would relent.

 This year's <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> ended with a tribute to trumpeter <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> that was a neatly planned, well-played concert which built to an exciting set with master musicians <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> invited the musicians and was the featured performer on `` <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and Friends'' at Town Hall on Saturday night. The final set had <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> on piano, <PERSON> Bellson </PERSON> on drums, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON> on electric guitar and bassist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasklin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> joined them on their fourth number, to play a warm solo on `` My Romance.'' The evening began with a group representing the Big B-A-D Band that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> formed in 1970. The trombone section was featured on `` Blues in My Shoes.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> sang `` I Want a Little Girl,'' backed by saxophonist <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabackin </PERSON>, a charming interlude. <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> sang, accompanied by pianist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, drummer <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, who once played with <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, and bassist <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaurine </PERSON>. She was effective with a song without rhymes or repeated musical phrases, with a lush <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> tune and a string of Count Basie blues songs. `` Trumpets No End,'' the arrangement of `` Blue Skies'' that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> did featuring six trumpets in the Ellington Band, gave its name to a segment by seven trumpet players. After <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> McGahie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> played solos, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Faddis </PERSON> pretty much wiped them up with high notes, speed and clear, long-held notes. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> played in the bands of <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnet </PERSON>, Count Basie and, from 1951 to'59, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>. After that he was regularly on the Tonight Show, then played with <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. He led a group with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brookmeyer </PERSON> in the 1970s. At Town Hall <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s sense of humor surfaced when he recited, with feeling and emphatic gestures, a poem in nonsense syllables. The next to last set was called <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and the Spacemen, because <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, inspired by Sputnik, called small groups from his band the Spacemen. Saturday night's included <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who played bass for <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, on piano, other Ellington alumni, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Turney </PERSON>, plus <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON>.

 Syrian gunners blasted the Christian sector of the Lebanese capital with shellfire Sunday, and rival militias backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> clashed in street battles in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. Ten people were killed and 29 wounded, they said. A Soviet envoy and the foreign ministers of three Arab countries working for a settlement of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war arrived in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Since the latest round of fighting began in March, 396 people have been killed and 1,532 wounded. Police said eight people were killed Sunday and 20 wounded in the Syrian bombardment of Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s sprawling residential districts of <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> and Furn el-Shubbak. One shell crashed into the bedroom of <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Abi-Aad </PERSON>, 31, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest, and his wife <PERSON> Renee </PERSON>, 24, in <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION>. They were killed as they slept, said a police spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules. The Syrians also pounded a 25-mile coastal stretch to prevent food, fuel and arms supplies from reaching the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. Christian militia gunners responded with intermittent barrages of 155mm shellfire. The police spokesman said two people were killed and nine wounded in the fighting between the Moslem militias. The gun battles raged all night and through Sunday morning between the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or party of God. It was the first major clash between the factions since the death of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on June 3. The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the more secular <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting for control of the million-strong Shiite community, the largest single sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war broke out on March 8 between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops, most of them Christians, and an alliance of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops and Druse forces. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> had stayed out of that confrontation. Soviet envoy <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> after winning a pledge from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s government, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe, to halt arms shipments to the Lebanese Christians if the Syrians stopped their daily bombardment of the Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Thawra </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pledge was `` a maneuver ... to mislead the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee.'' <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> carried a message from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, said a Soviet source who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have close ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets were <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main arms suppliers during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s leading Arab ally. The Arab League committee includes <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. The 22-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> has asked the committee to find a settlement to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s war by November. But so far it has been unable to enforce even a cease-fire called in May. The foreign ministers of the three countries were in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to discuss the truce violations. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lashed out at the Arab committee for keeping silent on Syrian violations of the cease-fire. `` The Arab committee is becoming a helpless spectator while the Syrians persist in their daily defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire calls. This is pushing the Lebanese to despair,'' he said in a statement broadcast by Christian radio stations. `` If the Arab League, which is supported by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, is incapable of making the Syrians respect its resolutions, then it must declare the Syrians as the defiers,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mandate to halt the civil war. Christians say the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> lost their role as neutral peacekeepers because they have sided with Moslems in the civil war. Meanwhile, in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, two militiamen of the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were wounded Sunday when their armored personnel carrier hit a mine, police reported. A police spokesman said the explosion occurred in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falous </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone,'' a strip of Lebanese border territory the Israelis have occupied since 1985. The spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the Lebanese militia retaliated by shelling the villages of Ka ` kaiyat il-Jisr and <PERSON> Zoutar </PERSON> No casualties were reported.

 The opposition socialists pulled ahead of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Monday in municipal elections viewed as a gauge of how well the scandal-ridden Liberal Democrats will fare in national elections. Women were expected to tilt the vote in favor of the opposition following a campaign that focused on a sex scandal in the governing party. With 47 of the 128 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> decided, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had won 22, nine more than the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The early results were considered significant since the Socialists held only 11 assembly seats coming into Sunday's election The Liberal Democrats had 63. The Clean Government Party had five seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> three, and independent candidates had won four, the television network said. About 5.18 million people, or 58.7 percent of the eligible voters, cast ballots Sunday. That was up from 53.5 percent in the last election in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> said. The election was being closely watched as a sign of how the Liberal Democrats, who have ruled <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since 1954, will do in a national election July 23 for half the seats in the upper house of the parliament, or Diet. More than 61 percent of registered women voted, compared to 56.16 percent of men, the board said. The high turnout, especially among women, was expected to favor the opposition. The opposition campaign focused on national issues, including an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; an influence-peddling scandal that forced the resignation of Prime Minster <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>; and a sex scandal centering on reports the new prime minister, <LOCATION> Sousuke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uno </LOCATION>, has kept paid mistresses. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported a women's group in <LOCATION> Miyazaki </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, gathered signatures from more than 1,000 women on a petition for the prime minister saying, `` It is an embarrassment for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to be represented at the summit by a person who tramples over women.'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> took office last month, and soon afterward, Japanese media published an interview with a former geisha who said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> paid her for sex. The woman later appeared in a television interview, and reports that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> kept other mistresses filled the press last week. The scandal has further tainted the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was badly shaken by the so-called Recruit scandal, which forced the resignation of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on June 2. The scandal involved the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing conglomerate accused of handing out millions of dollars in political contributions and bargain-priced stock in exchange for political favors. Only 25 percent of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> voters polled recently by the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said they planned to support Liberal Democrat candidates, down from 34 percent who expressed support in 1985. A <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> poll released Thursday showed 16 percent supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main opposition party, while support for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had fallen from 42.4 to only 13.2 percent. A poll published in the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a national daily, said the ruling party was likely to lose heavily. The poll showed women were breaking away from the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Women who said they would shift from the governing party to the socialists jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent, while those who said they would vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> shrank from 33 to 18 percent.

 A former major general in the Cuban military testified at his court-martial that he trafficked drugs because he wanted to invest in tourism projects like hotels, the Cuban news agency said Sunday. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who received medals for his wartime deeds, is one of 15 high-ranking military officers charged with high treason and trafficking in cocaine, diamonds and ivory. They were stripped of their rank and expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last week. Three major generals began hearing the case Friday. The 15 could face the firing squad if convicted. The Cuban government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and two aides, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, admitted their actions `` seriously endangered the prestige, morality and dignity of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, its armed forces, people and government.'' The agency said they `` showed themselves on <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> TV to be convinced that their guilt of narcotics trafficking and other crimes requires the most severe sanction.'' Earlier dispatches from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> said the defendants belonged to a secret division of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that smuggled medicine, hospital supplies and computers to circumvent a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo. One of the defendants is former Interior Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said on Sunday that he was `` thinking big'' when he decided to become involved in international drug trafficking in 1987, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. He said he planned to invest large amounts of money in hotel construction but did not intend to turn the island into a drug trafficking center. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said he had opened an account at the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viscaya </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1985. He did not give the purpose of the account, but said it was unrelated to drug trafficking. The defendants are accused of helping <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel smuggle cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and some of the others have said they dealt in cocaine to earn dollars to help <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s faltering economy. As a major general, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> took part in or directed fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, and served on missions in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and to help <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista regime. Also Sunday, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> expelled a correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news service, <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Trequesser </PERSON>, for `` falsely and maliciously'' reporting that two <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials wanted asylum in a foreign embassy. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Argiles </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trequesser </PERSON> `` falsely and maliciously'' linked `` the alleged search for asylum'' with the drug case. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trequesser </PERSON> reported that <PERSON> Osmani </PERSON> <PERSON> Cienfuegos </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciques </PERSON>, president of the state trading <ORGANIZATION> Corporacion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubanacan </ORGANIZATION>, had asked for asylum at an unnamed foreign embassy The London-based news agency confirmed the expulsion.

 A Greek tanker ringed by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels and a tugboat with pollution booms aboard began its journey to drydock Sunday morning, nine days after hitting a rock and spilling 420,000 gallons of oil into the ocean. The World Prodigy, with a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official aboard to oversee its captain and crew on the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was nudged by the tugboat to loosen its anchor chain and then began moving under its own power with a puff of black smoke from its engines. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter passed over the World Prodigy and saw no oil leaking from the vessel, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office. He said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aircraft would check the ship periodically during the trip. The ship will enter <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> harbor during Monday afternoon's high tide and will be repaired at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on the site of the old <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> Coast Guardsmen and onlookers at <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> were not sorry to see the tanker depart. `` The sooner they get out of here, the better,'' said <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>. `` I'm glad to see it's gone,'' agreed <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweetland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, a regular Sunday visitor to the park. `` There's a lot better view out here and with that thing sitting out there, anything could happen, I guess.'' Others at <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> praised the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s quick response to the spill and said it would not leave a lasting mark on <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. `` After three months goes by, this is all going to be forgotten,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seekonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` You come back here next year and ask people about the oil tanker, and I'd say 40 percent of the people wo n't know about the oil tanker.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Narragansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> pilot was aboard as the World Prodigy made its way out of the treacherous waters surrounding <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. The tanker's captain, who faces federal charges of violating pollution laws, has admitted he made a mistake in not having a pilot aboard when the accident happened on the afternoon of June 23. Soon after departure, all but one of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels dropped back from the tanker. The tugboat, carrying booms in case of another accident with the small amount of oil remaining on the ship, was the only vessel scheduled to accompany the tanker on its entire trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The World Prodigy was carrying nearly 8 million gallons of home heating oil at the time of the accident. Most of that oil was pumped out of the ship immediately afterward, but a layer of between a quarter-inch and 2 inches thick remained, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. He said the oil was being held in place by 24 feet of water and was not considered a threat to leak out. The oil that spilled, a relatively light form of oil compared with the crude oil that has caused such problems on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> beaches, has largely evaporated or dissipated. The Coast Guard vessels were not scheduled to accompany the tanker all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 Voters on Sunday tested the strength and honesty of the historically powerful <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in elections in five states. Troops guarded polls in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, where close races were expected. Also voting were residents of the states of <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zacatecas </LOCATION>. Polls officially closed at 6 p.m., but some remained open longer to allow people waiting in line at closing time to vote. Under Mexican law, the government has a week to announce election results. Opposition party members, congressmen and the independent Front for the Defense of the Vote monitored the 1,166 polling places in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>, an opposition stronghold, to see if President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s promise of clean elections was upheld. `` If he does n't accomplish this, everybody will see it and people will stop believing in him,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnetche </PERSON> of the 3,000-member independent citizens' group. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> alleged that officials in the northwestern border state used forged documents to register some people more than once. It also said officials burned 24,000 voter identification cards of purported dead people last week but that many of the cards belonged to opposition supporters. Some of Baja's 882,461 registered voters lined up early to choose a new governor, mayor and state legislature. The other states were choosing state legislatures. <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> also was electing all 67 mayors. In a hillside neighborhood of tar paper and plywood shacks in the border city of <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> voters said they began gathering outside polling stations at 5:30 a.m. `` I vote to improve the government. They make promises but do n't live up to them,'' said <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerillo </PERSON>, one of dozens waiting in line at one polling place The governing party faced tough opposition in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from conservatives and in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, the home of leftist opposition leader <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who ran for president last year. Some polls opened late in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, which was electing a new 24-member legislature. The governing party held 18 of these seats from the last election in 1986. In elections last year, <PERSON> Michoacanos </PERSON> gave 64 percent of their vote in the presidential election to <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, heading a leftist coalition. He recently formed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, congressman <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PAN </ORGANIZATION>, said no major incidents had been reported by late afternoon but there were problems with the indelible ink used to mark voters' fingers, a common complaint in Mexican elections. `` In some cases it works, to the point of burning the finger,'' he said by telephone. `` In others it does n't make a stain until hours later. In my case, it worked from the beginning and has n't come off and it's been four hours since I voted. PAN made substantial gains in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> in 1983 but lost ground to the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> three years later in elections marked by allegations of fraud. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, another PAN congressman, alleged the ink was part of <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s `` operation carrousel'' to have voters go from one polling place to another casting ballots. In Baja, the latest polls showed a dead heat between conservative <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> and governing party candidate <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON>, 37, a popular former mayor of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast city of <LOCATION> Ensenada </LOCATION>, said Saturday night that the situation was calm despite his party's complaints of voter irregularities. `` We're used to these irregularities. But we will watch officials and we are confident that the election will be successful,'' said <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON>. If he wins, he will become the first governor from an opposition party since the governing party was founded and rose to power 60 years ago. Ms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, 38, is considered honest even by her opponents and, if she wins, she would become <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s third woman governor. The opposition was hopeful of winning in this prosperous border state because its citizens gave <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> only one third of their votes in last year's election. A poll published Friday in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> at 33.7 percent and Ms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> with 32.7 percent of potential voters. Opposition parties claimed widespread voter fraud in the presidential election, but the governing party denied that. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has since campaigned against fraud and corruption.

 Investigations of alleged theft, cover-ups and illegal political contributions at <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have prompted new accounting and ethics policies among the toughest in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the utility says. At least three <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> employees have been fired or pressured to resign because of alleged financial wrongdoing, company officials say. Others were reprimanded or reassigned as part of efforts to halt corruption. A federal grand jury probe, a mysterious plane crash and the disappareance of a graphic designer who worked for the utility all helped to place <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> under intense scrutiny in the last year. `` I am truly convinced that <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> is on the right track now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dr. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> pediatrician and chairman of the utility's audit committee, wrote in a June 26 letter to employees. `` Virtually all of the problems ... I believe to be part of the company's past.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> has been a critic of past practices, accusing management of keeping him and other outside directors in the dark about what he termed unethical conduct, misconduct, mismanagement cover-ups and money laundering. Hanging on walls throughout <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s headquarters now is a copy of an ethics code prohibiting the doctoring of company books, using corporate funds for indirect political contributions, breaking laws for business ends, having financial conflicts of interest and accepting gifts from companies doing business with the utility. Many of the prohibitions cover the sorts of troubles that began surfacing when <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> received an anonymous letter replete with allegations after he became <PERSON> Gulf </PERSON>'s president in 1983. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> brought in a pair of investigators. Top executives reimbursed the company for using certain materials and services for personal purposes, although insisting most had been normal perquisites. Last year, two former Gulf managers were convicted of tax fraud and a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> businessman was convicted of perjury in kickback schemes. They allegedly stole more than $ 80,000 by billing Gulf for materials never delivered. Little attention was paid to Gulf outside the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> until almost a year ago, when a federal grand jury began probing the financial practices of its Atlanta-based parent, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. On April 10, 1988, <PERSON> Gulf </PERSON> became a focus of national attention when its senior vice president, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, and two Southern pilots died in a plane crash four minutes after taking off from <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>'s The cause of the crash remains a mystery, but just hours before the crash <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> was told the audit committee had recommended that he be fired because of accounting irregularities. An investigative report submitted to the committee indicated <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents had targeted <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, Southern President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>, former Southern President <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogtle </PERSON> and state Sen. W.D. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, D-Pensacola, a close friend of <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. The bizarre happenings continued when lawyer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> the day he died, claimed four dead canaries with their necks broken were left outside his office and homes, apparently as warnings against `` singing'' to authorities. Although the full scope of the investigations has yet to be disclosed, <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> officials say they have taken steps to tighten the utility's purchasing, contracting and warehousing operations. They also have suspended an informal political fund-raising organization and encouraged employees to anonymously report alleged wrongdoing. `` A vendor can no longer do business with <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unless they have a contract with the company,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>. `` Used to, if there was something I needed at an office supply store ... I could pick up supplies and they could bill us.'' <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> also has sent a letter to vendors urging them to let him know if employees have tried to coerce them into making political contributions because that is against company policy and no longer tolerated, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. The report to the audit committee alleged <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> had arranged for the utility to reimburse a supplier for a $ 1,000 campaign donation. Current and former employees have complained they felt pressured into making contributions through <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s official political action committee. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> grand jury has subpoenaed campaign finance records of 32 state, local and federal candidates in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, including those of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, former Gov. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> and former Sen. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. A subpoena is not an indication of any wrongdoing. Contracts for legal and other professional services now are more detailed and can be approved only by <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. A mid-managment official had approved contracts with <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a graphic designer paid $ 1.2 million by the utility from 1980 through last year. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to testify before the grand jury Dec. 7, but never appeared. He turned up two days later in the office of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> lawyer to sign over his interest in their <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> home to his ex-wife. He was never seen again.

<HEAD>SEC's NY Regional Office is Moving July 21</HEAD>

 The people who helped bring down <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> are moving up _ two floors _ and over about seven blocks. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional office of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will be trading its longtime base at 26 Federal Plaza in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for new quarters near the World Trade Center later this month. After more than 20 years at the aging, 42-story government office building that also houses the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and some 80 other federal agencies near the city's courts and municipal buildings, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> local staff is moving into private office space closer to the financial district it regulates. The agency will exchange the slighty shabby federal building with its beige walls and balky elevators for two entire floors atop 75 Park Place, a sleek, glass and metal, 13-story office building that opened less than two years ago. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, biggest of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s nine regional offices, will be expanding its office space from 34,000 square feet to 40,000 square feet, according to <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miscione </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which administers federal office buildings. Other tenants in the new location include the publisher R.R. <ORGANIZATION> Donnelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons and the legal department of the city's housing authority. While <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Regional Administrator <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Iason </PERSON> and his staff of about 200 are happy about the move, they also do n't have much choice. The 850 staffers of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, who already occupy parts of 12 floors at 26 Federal Plaza, need more space and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s offices fit the bill. `` But it's not like -LRB- the move -RRB- is n't beneficial,'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyl </PERSON>, regional counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said during a recent interview as she tried to find room for storing 100 office chairs that arrived three weeks early. The public reference room, where company filings and other <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> documents are made available, will be expanded slightly, said <PERSON> Iason </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Texas Oilman: Japan Blocking Open Access To Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says a `` stiff arm'' from a Japanese company that rejected his bid for three board seats shows that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is blocking foreign access to its financial markets. `` I believe my experience symbolizes, in many ways, U.S.-Japanese trade relations on a much broader scale,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> wrote in a bylined, front-page article in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` It certainly underscores that the U.S.-Japan trade relationship is not a two-way street.'' `` The fact is that <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> does not want an outsider observing its system from the inside,'' he added. `` And apparently it will do anything _ even if it defies common sense _ to prevent open access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s financial markets.'' <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last week rejected the <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> oilman's bid for seats on its board of directors <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is the largest shareholder in the Tokyo-based company, with 20.2 percent of stock. <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ viewed as the real power behind <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> _ has placed three directors on the company's board. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> wrote that he went to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to press for shareholder rights and `` was given a stiff arm.'' He said he was n't surprised, though, because the <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> board in April rejected his request for representation <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of its stake from a well-known Japanese raider, <PERSON> Kitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, may have raised <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s suspicion of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the company should n't be wary of him. `` Common sense dictates that <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, should also be entitled to three seats,'' he wrote. `` But common sense is not having the upper hand in this whole affair _ or, for that matter, in much of present-day corporate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> compared <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s corporate climate to American business 100 years ago, a time of huge cartels. `` At the turn of the century, we began to break up those trusts and open our markets to everyone who wished to participate,'' he wrote. `` The trust-busting unleashed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s entrepreneurs and proved to be a great boon to the country.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must open its economy or face a decline in prosperity. `` While the Japanese people have done remarkably well in recent times, if they do not make serious attempts to open their closed economy, their continued economic prosperity will undoubtedly suffer _ if not of stagnation from within, perhaps of retaliation from without,'' he said.

<HEAD>Continental Offers $76 One-Way Fare After Holiday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday announced $ 76 one-way fares on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights for three days following the Fourth of July holiday. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it would match the offer. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s fare will be offered on all mainland <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights where seats are available for trips beginning Thursday, Friday or Saturday, the airline said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said the deal was prompted by anticipated light business travel because the July 4 holiday Tuesday falls near the middle of a week. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the Chicago-based carrier will match the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> fare in all competitive markets. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s commuter airline, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, is exempt from the deal, he said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s sale fare requires no advance purchase, but tickets must be bought within 24 hours of making a reservation. Travelers may return as early as next Sunday or stay longer. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said in most markets the fare is the lowest offered in years. The airline's lowest advance-purchase fare from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, currently is $ 149, compared to the new $ 76 fare. Other low advance-purchase one-way fares are $ 179 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; $ 149 from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; and $ 169 from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Tickets are nonrefundable and seats limited, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said. The carrier estimated that more than 200,000 seats on its mainland <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system are available for trips starting on the three days. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has about 1,400 daily departures between 82 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities.
