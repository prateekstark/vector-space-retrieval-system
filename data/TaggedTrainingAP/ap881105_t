<TEXT>
 A treaty banning genocide finally has the force of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, bringing to a close 40 years of opposition by conservatives and putting a final feather in the political cap of retiring Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Friday to implement the treaty, which was ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 11, 1986. By the time the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acted, 95 other nations had ratified the treaty. The implementing legislation was passed last month. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> had delivered more than 3,000 speeches over 19 years before the ratification vote. Conservatives fought it all the way. They contended the treaty undermined rights of Americans under the Constitution and infringed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sovereignty. The legislation signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> implements the treaty by making genocide _ the deliberate destruction of a specific population _ punishable under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law and setting stern penalties for violators. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the genocide implementation bill is officially called `` The Proxmire Act'' to honor the long crusade of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat who is closing out a 31-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career. Speaking Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>.. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said he was not given enough advance notice to attend the bill signing ceremony `` I was sorry I could not be there, but the important thing is that it was signed,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. `` It should have been done long ago.'' The treaty was drafted after World War II as a response to the Nazi Holocaust that killed millions of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Jews and other ethnic minorities. It was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> at the end of 1948 and submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early the next year by President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> frequently embarrassed American diplomats by claiming that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to ratify the pact was evidence the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lacked a complete commitment to human rights. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the genocide bill at a ceremony at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, saying he was `` delighted to fulfill the promise made by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> to all the peoples of the world _ and especially the Jewish people.'' The president recalled the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps that claimed millions of Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and others and said similar atrocities have since taken place in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. These events `` only renew our rage and righteous fury and make this moment all the more significant for me and all Americans,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 14, shortly before the genocide bill was passed, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said the treaty was made necessary `` by the deliberate murder of 6 million Jews.'' `` They were gassed, lined up and shot and they were worked to death,'' he said. `` Why? Only because they worshipped God in a different way.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> drew praise from his colleagues for his `` long and often lonely'' fight and Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` I have no single doubt in my mind that there would be no treaty without Senator <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>. `` The senator from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> never stopped talking; his was a kind of moral filibuster,'' said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, international president of B'Nai B'rith, at a reception honoring <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> a few days later. The Proxmire Act defines genocide as an action taken with a `` specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'' It would apply to activities in which members of those groups were killed, seriously injured or permanently impaired through the use of drugs, torture or `` similar techniques'' or were subjected to conditions aimed at causing `` the physical destruction of the group.'' Also included are efforts to prevent births within a group or forcefully removing children. If death results, people found responsible could be fined up to $ 1 million and imprisoned for life. Where no death is involved, the punishment is set at a fine of up to $ 1 million and 20 ears in prison. Under the law, anyone convicted of inciting another to violate its terms could be fined up to $ 500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years. Legalistic and conservative objections to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the genocide treaty were raised from the beginning. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Korey </PERSON>, director for international policy research for B'nai B'rith International, wrote in a recent account about the struggle to ratify the pact that part of the problem arose over the treaty's attempt to outlaw genocide `` in whole or in part.'' `` Fears were apparent in various segregationist circles that the reference to `` in part'' might be applied to a limited form of race violence, such as lynchings,'' <PERSON> Korey </PERSON> said. `` The phrase ` mental harm' also raised concerns.'' Other critics said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might be embarrassed by an international show trial based on alleged atrocities against <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the 19th century. Still others expressed fear that ratification could result in American citizens being tried against their will by an international tribunal, without the protections accorded by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. These fears were dealt with in 1986 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted reservations asserting the right of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens to contitutional protections and giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the right to exempt itself from compulsory jurisdiction in genocide cases before the World Court.

<TEXT>
 A Pentagon audit says vague guidelines are to blame for millions of dollars in questionable payments to major defense contractors for work performed by outside consultants. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in a review of 12 of the top 100 defense contractors, questioned the validity of claims for $ 43 million out of the $ 236.5 million charged to the government over the past year for consultants. A separate audit, by the Pentagon Inspector General's office, estimated that an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> logistics center in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> paid an estimated $ 104 million for spare parts that did not meet contract specifications, amounting to 89 percent of its inventory. The review of consultants' fees by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> agency involved 12 major contractors: <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNISYS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The audit, released Friday, found that the internal business discipline one would expect at a large company for hiring outsiders is, `` in most cases, non-existent.'' If anything, the total for questionable claims is `` understated,'' the audit added. Often, contractors simply could not explain what work their consultants had performed, the auditors wrote. And in some cases, it appears the consultants performed lobbying or publicity work that should not have been reimbursed. The <ORGANIZATION> DCAA </ORGANIZATION> audit, spawned by a massive fraud investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, depicts a clubby atmosphere in which major contractors rarely ask that consultant contracts be put in writing and frequently hire consultants without soliciting competitive bids. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in releasing the audit, announced it already had written new regulations to address the <ORGANIZATION> DCAA </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns. The audit was ordered last July after disclosures that federal prosecutors were conducting a wide-ranging fraud investigation focusing on contractors and their outside consultants along with selected <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees. The separate audit on the procurement of spare parts by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the service `` did not receive the quality parts it paid for.'' A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, took sharp issue with the draft Inspector General's report, which was obtained and distributed by the Project on Military Procurement, a private watchdog group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The figure is very misleading,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrotte </PERSON>. `` They tested a sample and made projections,'' he said, challenging both the methods and the calculations used by the Inspector General's office. To make their estimate, auditors from the inspector general's office visited the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 18 miles south of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and checked samples of inventory items ranging from a bolt costing $ 6.95 to more complicated hardware costing thousands of dollars per item The total value of the items checked was $ 114.4 million, of which $ 48.4 million worth were found to have major `` nonconformances'' which made them unfit for service and $ 55 million had less serious problems, known as minor nonconformances. The auditors checked 1,027 samples of 46 different items, and projected their results against a total of 685,925 spare parts calculated to have been at the center. Those projections showed that 89 percent of the spares did not meet contract specifications.

<HEAD>Budget Office Says Cost of Super Collider May be Underestimated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Energy Department's estimate of the cost of building a superconducting super collider could be nearly 50 percent too low, a government study says. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study said the price tag could be $ 6.4 billion if costs follow the pattern for atom smashers already built. It offered a second estimate, which it said was based on more conservative assumptions, of $ 5.1 billion. The Energy Department has put the project's cost at $ 4.4 billion, a figure it said was accurate within 10 percent given that final design studies will not be done until a site is chosen. The collider would be a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets capable of whipping proton beams together with 20 times the force of the most powerful existing accelerator, the Tevatron at the <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions The study released this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may have underestimated the price of collider components such as proton-collision detectors and overestimated savings expected from advances in the manufacture of superconducting magnets. Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated $ 205 million for the collider, including $ 100 million for research and development in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, but has not authorized its construction. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were chosen as finalists from among 25 states bidding for the collider, which will provide its host with thousands of construction jobs and permanent work for as many as 3,000 people. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> is expected to announce a tentative site selection this month and confirm the choice by January 1989.

 A decorated former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel who inadvertently shot a 30mm anti-tank shell into a service station gasoline pump has escaped criminal charges. <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> General District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> on Friday dismissed a misdemeanor charge against <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON>, saying, `` I'm convinced that you have suffered enough. The judge noted that <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> scraped together $ 50,000 to help compensate the people injured by flying shrapnel in the August 1986 explosion. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> had pleaded no contest a little over a year ago to the misdemeanor charge of discharging a firearm in a public place. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> had postponed sentencing in order to give <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> a chance to try to compensate the people hurt in the explosion. Three of the four people injured sued <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> and the federal government. Attorneys for the injured said the government was partly at fault for supplying <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> with ammunition. The Army never admitted liability, but one of <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON>'s attorneys said the government had agreed to pay 80 percent of the settlement to the victims. That agreement was reached about two weeks ago. `` It seems to me that the injured people have been satisfied,'' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said. The local prosecutor did not object to the dismissal of the charge. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON>, who was trying to market the 30mm anti-tank cannon to the Pentagon at the time of the accident, refused comment after the hearing. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> told authorities he had been filling his pickup truck with gasoline when he noticed his companion, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON>, was examining the cannon. When he tried to show <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> how the weapon worked, `` it went off. Nobody could have been more surprised than myself.'' Following the explosion, <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> said, he picked up one victim and pulled her away from the burning pumps, then moved the truck and another vehicle away from the pumps. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> drove away from the scene, but had second thoughts and said they had started circling back toward the station when stopped by police. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said he considered criminal penalties because <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> _ winner of three Silver Stars and four Distinguished Flying Crosses in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ left the scene of the accident. `` The only upsetting part of this was the walking away,'' the judge said. `` That is the only reason I would have denied the -LRB- dismissal -RRB- request.'' <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a former gas station employee, had sought $ 2.4 million in damages. <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, who were sitting in a nearby car when the pump exploded, sought $ 1 million each. All three were injured by metal fragments from the explosion.

<HEAD>FDA Says Three Patients Dead From Vitamin B1 Deficiency; Warns
Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three people receiving intravenous feedings have died from a vitamin B1 deficiency, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced as it urged doctors to be sure patients being fed by needle are getting the essential nutrient. Identities of the patients were not released, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the deaths were indirectly due to a national shortage of a multivitamin preparation usually added to the liquid given patients receiving intravenous feedings. The shortage occurred after a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> manufacturer of the multivitamin supplement, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had to cut production after the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> ordered a recall in July of some of the company's product. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that as a result of the shortage, the federal agency was concerned that patients receiving the IV feedings would not receive vitamin B1, or thiamine, which is essential to the body. `` Potentially fatal thiamine deficiencies could result because thiamine is consumed at a high rate in patients receiving intravenous feedings of glucose sugar,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement. The announcement came after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for Parentral and <ORGANIZATION> Enternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of experts in IV feedings, warned its 5,000 members that three patients receiving IV feedings have died as a result of thiamine deficiency. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Regenstein </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> ASPEN </LOCATION>, confirmed the deaths, but said the organization's legal counsel had advised against identifying the patients. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said he had no further details on the deaths. Intravenous, or IV, feedings are used for patients who are unable to take food by mouth. This would include those who are unconscious or who do not have an intact digestive system due to surgery, injury or disease. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, a dietician for <LOCATION> ASPEN </LOCATION>, said those most at risk are patients receiving what is called parentral feedings. She said such patients receive liquid feedings of 70 percent glucose through a needle that leads directly into the aorta. A shortage of thiamine in such patients can develop in as little as a week because the vitamin is essential for metabolizing the glucose. About 10,000 to 15,000 patients in the nation are on parentral feeding, she said. Vitamin B1 is essential for functioning of the cardiovascular and nervous system, and for metabolism. A deficiency results in a disease called beriberi. Severe cases can lead to heart failure and death. Thiamine easily can be added to the routine IV feedings, Ms. <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>, the company chose to close its <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> plant for a time after <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors found a problem that involved keeping products sterile. She said the problem has been corrected and <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> is now back into full production. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said it is expected that the shortage of the vitamin supplement will be corrected soon.

<HEAD>President Signs Into Law Bill Raising AIDS Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed into law legislation boosting spending on AIDS testing, research and education by up to $ 870 million a year. The compromise measure, stripped of controversial elements that had tied it up for months, was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in separate voice votes on Oct. 13. White House officials traveling with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday announced in <LOCATION> Voorhees </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, that the president had signed the measure. Fearful that no legislation expanding spending on AIDS programs would be passed because of opposition from conservatives _ particuarly Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> _ the measure's chief backers agreed to bring it up as part of an overall health package that skirted the controversial matters of confidentiality for AIDS test results and antidiscrimination protection for those found to carry the virus. As finally approved, the measure authorizes $ 100 million a year for AIDS testing over the next two years and an additional $ 100 million in each of the next two years for home health care of people with AIDS. It also includes up to $ 300 million in new research funds in each of the next three years and $ 370 million additional for AIDS education. Although disappointed they were not able to push through provisions guaranteeing confidentiality and antidiscrimination protection, AIDS activists in and out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said a bill that essentially just expanded spending without breaking new policy ground was better than no bill at all. The main authors, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., have vowed to continue their quest for confidentiality and antidiscrimination protection when the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in Whatever the outcome of the presidential election next Tuesday, backers of such provisions are encouraged they will have more support from the White House. Both Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have said they support the White House AIDS commission's call last summer for federal antidiscrimination legislation as the single most important tool in fighting the disease. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made no such declaration, referring the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for study. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top health adviser told reporters this week that the vice president, if elected, would push for antidiscrimination legislation. Health professionals maintain that the best way to curb the spread of the virus, which federal officials estimate has already infected up to 1.5 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents, is to do everything possible to encourage people to come forward for testing and counseling. And the best way to do that, they argue, is to insure that people who carry the virus will not be punished by arbitrarily losing their jobs, homes and health insurance. The chief victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnsed in 76,932 Americans, of whom more than half, or 43,177, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature fell today after doctors gave him antibiotics to alleviate intestinal inflammation brought about by a slight discharge of blood, a palace spokesman said. Court doctors said antibiotics were administered Friday for the first time since mid-October to alleviate the inflammation of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s upper intestinal area. The world's longest-reigning living monarch, 87, has been bedridden since Sept. 19 when he vomited blood because of internal hemorrhaging. He has continued to bleed intermittently, including Friday night, mostly in the upper intestinal area where he underwent a bypass operation last year. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has received 34.2 pints of blood to combat anemia and internal bleeding since his health worsened. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Kyoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosho </PERSON>, a palace in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> where the imperial family lived until 1868, will open to the public for five days starting today for a biannual festival. But some attractions, including music and dancing, were called off in deference to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s illness, palace officials said.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a final day of campaigning there in hopes of putting <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the top in that most important state. `` This is the big prize. Forty-seven electoral votes,'' he said on arrival Friday night at the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> airport. `` We win this one, we win it all,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> claimed the latest polls showed the Republican lead collapsing and insisted the Democrats still had time to catch them by election day. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to attend a get-out-the-vote rally this morning in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The Republicans are dropping like a rock in those polls,'' he told the cheering crowd of several hundred at the airport rally. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> earlier in the day. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> worked to highlight the Democratic ticket's commitment to the space program, which has a major presence in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> industry and with the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator toured the Challenger Center at the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. The center was founded as part of an effort, in the wake of the 1986 Challenger space shuttle tragedy, to boost interest in science and technology among the young. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> looked at a mock space station to watch fourth graders operate various devices, and he took an electronic stress test. A girl held wires to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s finger and measured only 1.6 on a scale in which 5 is considered normal. `` That means I'm cool,'' the senator quipped. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also met with a student audience in the museum auditorium, and made an unusual miscue. The man <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said would head up his cabinet council on space asserted that the next space shuttle launched, the Atlantis, would be unmanned. In fact, the ship will have a crew of five for its secret military mission later this month. Aides attributed the mistake to an incorrect briefing paper. On his way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, for a rally at that airport with about 500 supporters, hosted by Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he wanted to `` set'em straight'' on issues the Republicans have distorted, such as gun control and defense. The <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION> area is near the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION> testing area, and government research dollars are important to the area economy. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the crowd a Democratic administration would spend $ 1 billion a year on research on Star Wars. The Democrats currently oppose deployment of a space-based missile defense system.

 The French vote Sunday on a referendum the government hopes will bring peace to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> following a campaign that has generated little enthusiasm and confusion about what they're voting on. Polls leading up to the vote indicate only 38 percent of the eligible voters will cast ballots. Of those who said they would go to the polls, 84 percent said they would approve the plan. Periodic violence has broken out in the territory since November 1984 between native Melanesians, known locally as Kanaks, and white settlers, called Caldoches. Nearly 40 people have been killed. On April 22, Melanesians attacked a police station on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, killing four policemen and taking 27 others hostage. On May 5, an assault on a cave where the kidnappers held the hostages killed two more policemen and 19 Kanaks. The latest attacks sobered Caledonians, native and European, and caused them to rethink their attitudes. The plan to be voted on Sunday has attracted great support in mainland <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Governing Socialists, Communists, and center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> all are backing a `` yes'' vote on Sunday. Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has taken a front-line role in the campaign. `` I do n't want there to be any more violence and deaths in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>,'' the premier said. `` I say no to civil war, and the only means of preventing this danger is the ` yes' in the referendum,'' he said. The conservative Rally for the Republic is campaigning for absention. It says it can not disavow its local arm, which agreed to the plan, but also can not vote for it because of constitutional objections. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Socialist government is asking voters Sunday to approve measures set out in 96 articles of a long draft law that few people have read and, because of its legalistic language, even fewer have understood. Some people interviewed by newspapers and television seem to think they are voting directly on independence for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. Others are not sure exactly what they are voting for, though some say they will vote anyway. The essential provision is for a local referendum in 10 years to decide if the territory becomes independent or remains French. Meanwhile, the new law would divide <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> into three provinces, each with its own local assembly, and an elected territorial congress with no pre-determined ethnic breakdown. The territory would be ruled directly from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> until next summer, when the new bodies and local administration would take over. The population of the archipelago, controlled by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since 1853, is 145,000. Forty-three percent are native Melanesians mostly favoring independence. But they are in the minority because most Polynesians and Asians support the European community of 37 percent that generally wants to remain French. The plan to be put before French voters Sunday came out of June discussions between <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON>, head of anti-independence <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caledonia </ORGANIZATION> in the Republic. They met in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, and the resulting plan was lauded as one of the successes of <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s new government. A referendum on independence was held in the territory Sept. 13, 1987, when local voters supported remaining French by 98.3 percent to 1.7 percent. But the main Melanesian group had called for a boycott, keeping turnout to 59 percent. All eligible French voters, including those in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and other overseas territories, may vote Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Keeping the public informed about the illness of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has proved to be a marathon job for an overworked palace staff and weary press corps. Hundreds of journalists stake out the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the seven gates to the moated palace in hopes of snaring visitors who have just seen <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, or of gleaning a clue to his health from seeing who is entering the palace _ the chief doctors, or a blood-delivery car. Dozens of Japanese reporters and cameramen fill the vaulted halls of the palace agency, rolled up in blankets on the floor, slumped over lawn chairs or vacantly reading comic books. Others scribble away elbow to elbow at tiny desks in the press room. Some go home so rarely that the media have virtually taken over nearby hotels. `` We've had a couple of reporters hospitalized out of sheer fatigue,'' said a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, a major private TV network. News reports have consisted almost entirely of detailed updates on <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s pulse, temperature, blood pressure, respiration, blood transfusions and vague palace comments that the monarch is `` resting.'' The 87-year-old <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> began suffering from internal bleeding Sept. 19 and since has been given many blood transfusions. The sole official source for such news is <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, who until July was police chief in northern <LOCATION> Aomori </LOCATION> prefecture. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, 49, is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, which means he is in charge of security as well as palace spokesman. When he took the job, he hastily studied up on imperial history and traditions, but concedes there is no time for that now. The 20-year police veteran still is getting used to the intricacies of the imperial household and the specialized language used to talk to and about family members. `` I admit it all makes me nervous,'' he says carefully, his eyes fluttering from lack of sleep. `` It's been true on-the-job training.'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, works 12 to 13 hours daily, seven days a week, then faces more telephone calls and reporters when he gets home. The palace press club is a tightly knit grouping of nine big newspapers and six TV networks. Following a Japanese media tradition that gives them exclusive coverage rights, other Japanese media and foreign reporters are barred from membership. `` We understand the media's deep interest,'' said <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>. `` But they want everything. We just tell them what we feel is necessary.'' His office view of black pine, camphor and sweet acorn trees is marred by a parking lot jammed with media vans bristling with antennae and microwave dishes. Six black telephones sit beside <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>'s desk, linked with other extensions in the agency, the Fukiage palace where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is bedridden and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. A portrait of the imperial family hangs on a wall next to a huge photograph of the emperor hosting a banquet for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Once viewed as a living god, the emperor still is seen by many as a hallowed symbol of state. According to <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> rules, he may be seen but not heard on television, except in rare appearances before the public, and palace officials refuse to describe his private conversations. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, like any Japanese bureaucrat, refuses to talk about what happens once <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> dies, dismissing such questions as `` hypothetical.'' For the media, it has been an enormous expense. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates it spends $ 160,000 a day on emperor coverage, while TV networks face daily bills of $ 240,000. But the reporting has been a windfall for some. One <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> correspondent said he earned $ 4,000 in overtime during the first month of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s illness.

 The old-favorite pairing of `` Cavalleria Rusticana'' and `` Pagliacci'' returned to the Metropolitan Opera Friday night after three years away. Both had their thrilling moments as well as moments that were n't. <PERSON> Ghena </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrova </PERSON>, singing her first <PERSON> Santuzza </PERSON> in `` Cav'' at the Met, has wonderful vocal power which she put on the boil as a woman scorned. Her voice can simultaneously have a harsh delivery, showing <PERSON> Santuzza </PERSON>'s bitter feelings, and a beautiful, big sound. She and tenor <PERSON> Ermanno </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON>, singing Turiddu, blended well, though they did n't always attack the notes at the same time. Their duet in which she pleads with him to return contained passionate singing. Baritone <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Pola </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rovereto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, made his Met debut as the farmer whose bride has taken up with Turiddu. He did n't make a favorable impression. Soprano <PERSON> Ilona </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokody </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, also made her Met debut Friday, as <PERSON> Nedda </PERSON> in `` Pagliacci.'' She has a strong vibrato which sounds unpleasant to Americans, who usually prefer a clear tone. <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> sang in `` Pag'' also. He sounded good in both but did n't quite make the most of his big `` Pagliacci'' aria `` Vesti la giubba. His finale was stirring. The strongest impressions in the second opera were made by <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ciudadela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, singing the Prologue in a focused voice which held the ear's rapt attention without shouting and baritone <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, whose singing as <PERSON> Nedda </PERSON>'s lover sounded intensely romantic. <PERSON> Alessandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Siciliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, made his Met debut conducting, with more graceful results in `` Cavalleria Rusticana'' than in `` Pagliacci.''

 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> incumbents, perennially better able to raise money than their challengers, have 14 times more financial ammunition left to fire than their opponents in the campaign's final days. A report released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, based on candidates' financial activities through Oct. 19, showed that office-holders had $ 94.7 million left to spend, compared to $ 6.4 million for their opponents. Democratic incumbents held a $ 13.7 million to $ 900,000 edge over <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challengers in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 45.6 million to $ 1.2 million advantage in the House. Republican lawmakers had an advantage over their Democratic challengers of $ 5.9 million to $ 2.2 million in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and $ 29.5 million to $ 2.1 million in the House. Overall, the report said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hopefuls had so far raised $ 157.5 million, barely $ 1 million more than in 1986. There are 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat contests this year, one less than there was two years ago. Candidates for the 435 House seats have reported raising $ 202.3 million, 8 percent more than the $ 187.6 million they collected for their warchests in 1986. Of the total, $ 119.7 million has been contributed by political action committees, which are formed by corporations, labor unions, issue-oriented groups and other organizations to donate money to candidates. On average, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates have raised two-thirds of their money from individuals and 24 percent from PACs, the same percentages as two years ago. House contenders have garnered 49 percent of their money from individuals, down from 51 percent in 1986, and 40 percent from PACs, up from 35 percent in 1986. So far, Democratic incumbents have done a better job of raising money than their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challengers by $ 47 million to $ 19.6 million in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and $ 88.5 million to $ 14.7 million in the House. At the same time, Republican office-holders have collected more than their Democratic opponents by $ 41.8 million to $ 21.7 million in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and $ 62.9 million to $ 17.2 million in the House. The five top <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> money raisers, and the amounts they have collected overall and from PACs, are Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., $ 9.9 million, $ 1.6 million; Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, $ 7.8 million, $ 2.1 million; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, a Republican running in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 7.1 million, $ 1.2 million; Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 6.6 million, $ 884,000; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, $ 6.6 million, $ 734,000 The five top House money raisers, and the amounts they have collected overall and from PACs, are Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., $ 1.4 million, $ 62,000; Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 1.3 million, $ 314,000; Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., $ 1.3 million, $ 250,000; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 19th District, $ 1.3 million, $ 408,000; Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, D-Wis., $ 1.2 million,

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says Governor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can not reconcile talk of the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' with the fact that a state current-accounts fund is nearly $ 190 million in the red. `` We know, right now, that state's revenue collections are way below estimates,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, told a campaign rally in this northeastern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> city. Appearing later Friday before some 5,000 to 6,000 <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, one of the largest <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> crowds of the campaign, the senator mocked `` tax hike Mike'' and said young people should trust <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to ensure continued economic prosperity. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was touring the mid-Atlantic states of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> today as the long campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> neared its conclusion. In the <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> speech, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> excoriated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the current-accounts problem, saying it was evidence of mistaken tax-and-spend policies. `` This week the citizens of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> awoke to find out that their state's bank accounts have been overdrawn up to $ 190 million for the past 30 days,'' he said. `` He likes to talk about a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` But the only miracle involving <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> will be the one he needs to get out of the mess he created for his state.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that `` despite the totally false denials made by Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his last debate with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, we knew the fiscal situation was bad.'' The state constitution in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> requires a balanced budget. But the amount of tax receipts that have been coming into the state's coffers have been less than anticipated by the office of state treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>. Consequently, the balance in the current account accrued a deficit of close to $ 190 million. Governors faced with less-than-expected state tax revenues often issue what are called revenue anticipation bonds, meaning they borrow money against the revenue they expect to come in, thus closing the gap. But in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> situation, state officials apparently opted to pay the interest on the $ 190 million overdraft rather than face a higher prevailing interest rate on the floating of such bonds. The state has over $ 1 billion in separate accounts, but these monies are untouchable; they involve funds raised through other bond issues for projects such as highway construction and public works. Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the federal debt has more than doubled, surpassing $ 2 trillion. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his fourth visit to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and boasted that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have a `` Southern strategy'' that will produce big victories in the region next Tuesday. During the <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> speech the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said, `` I doubt if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been spending too much time in the South. ... He thinks alligators are something you buy in a shoe store.''

 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> announcement that it is suspending its troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> culminates months of protests against the continued arming of Afghan rebels by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Friday announcement could mark an unraveling of the carefully crafted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan Agreement, signed April 13 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. That accord was considered the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> victory in years, resolving a regional conflict and showing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was trying to extricate itself from such conflicts worldwide. The development comes one day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> adopted its first consensus resolution in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreed on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats say some nations may have overestimated <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> determination to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, end an unpopular war and cut its losses at any cost. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> proudly admits arming the Moslem rebels and denies it is violating the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreement, but it accuses <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of violating it by aiding the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and, most recently, by providing SS-1 Scud missiles and using Backfire bombers. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks, had not seen the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> report and had no immediate comment, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The Soviets on Friday announced the suspension of their troop withdrawal because of recent Afghan rebel successes and indicated they might not meet the Feb. 15 withdrawal deadline unless the attacks stop. It was the clearest Soviet statement that continued arming of Afghan rebels by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not be tolerated and could jeopardize the withdrawal schedule. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has repeatedly protested such Pakistani aid, saying it violates the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement's call for non-interference in Afghan and Pakistani internal affairs. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> might have to reconsider and possibly extend its withdrawal schedule if violations and aid to the rebels continue and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as a guarantor, must bear some responsibility. In September, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Soviets have not yet started the second phase of their withdrawal. `` Let's wait and see. It is necessary to stop the violations that take place.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, `` As soon as Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop production line of violations was set in motion.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> appealed to the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to discuss agreement violations. The five are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Under the Afghanistan Agreement, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw half its 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15, and the remainder by Feb. 15. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group of 50 soldiers certified the Soviet pullout, but the Soviets complained the group operates poorly and has not investigated violations _ the arming of rebels. The agreement also requires non-interference by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in each other's internal affairs. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> say the arming of rebels by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violates the agreement. Most of the aid comes from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is funneled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But diplomats say the Americans and Soviets tacitly agreed if one side continues aiding and arming clients, the other side may do the same. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the Soviets have used SS-1 Scud missiles against rebel positions and Backfire bombers to aid Afghan forces under attack. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says the introduction of Soviet missiles violates the accord. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says arming the rebels is a violation. On Thursday, for the first time in nine years, when <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> troops moved in to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> by consensus adopted its annual <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> resolution without a divisive vote calling for Soviet withdrawal or criticisms of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. This year, a milder resolution expressed satisfaction with the troop withdrawal and expectation of its completion by Feb. 15. It was adopted by acclamation, with agreement among the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 Here are some comments Friday from the presidential campaign trail: <PERSON> MICHAEL </PERSON> <PERSON> DUKAKIS </PERSON>, saying there's nothing wrong with talking to terrorists as long as no concessions are made: `` I've never said that you do n't negotiate. You talk, you make every effort to get those hostages back home, but you never make concessions to the hostage takers.'' <PERSON> GEORGE </PERSON> <PERSON> BUSH </PERSON>, denying Americans are turned off by negative campaigning: `` The idea that this campaign is so different from others _ I do n't believe it. I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people believe it, all this stuff about being turned off. You can always go out and find people to say that. Our people do n't say that when I get off this airplane.'' <PERSON> LLOYD </PERSON> <PERSON> BENTSEN </PERSON>, asked by young <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> student how he got to be vice president: `` I have n't done it yet.'' <PERSON> MICHAEL </PERSON> <PERSON> DUKAKIS </PERSON>, blasting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for borrowing the Democrat's standard rallying cry on Thursday: `` Four days before the election, after all the symbols and slogans, four days before the election, he tells you he's on your side Who's he kidding?'' <PERSON> DAN </PERSON> <PERSON> QUAYLE </PERSON>, citing a nearly $ 190 million overdraft in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' current bank account as evidence <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is ill-equipped to manage the federal government: `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are not only just beginning to find out how bad it really is, but they are finding, as we are, that the fiscal situation in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is a time bomb set to explode in the faces of its citizens.'' <PERSON> RONALD </PERSON> <PERSON> REAGAN </PERSON>, stumping for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` If you want to know who's on the side of the little guy, well, I'll tell you, it's the big guy, the big guy from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.''

 Ground-breaking reforms in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> are fueling cautious hope among Lithuanian emigres, but also stirring discord over the prospect that some degree of independence may be on the horizon. `` We are all a little bit shocked'' by the changes, said <PERSON> Algis </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimaitis </PERSON>, a Lithuanian dissident who lives in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and works with the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He said some people are too quick to accept the Soviet reforms, `` and some people are too skeptical. We must find a middle way.'' The debate over tactics has heated up in the last two weeks following an inaugural conference in the Lithuanian capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> of the officially sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION>, which takes its name from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan of economic and social reform. About 20,000 people gathered for the Oct. 22-23 conference, where more than 1,000 delegates, including many <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, adopted resolutions demanding sweeping reforms for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, already one of the most progressive of the 15 Soviet republics. Emigres who participated in the conference said that within a few days, the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party began to reduce food and medical privileges enjoyed by its elite members. And last week, the newly installed party chief, <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, announced plans to free several prominent political prisoners. <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieliauskas </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and one of a few <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens allowed to attend the conference, said `` enthusiasm is quite high'' in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` People were sitting at the television _ it was transmitting everything from the conference _ and people were crying,'' he said after returning home to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bieliauskas </PERSON>, whose organization says it represents a quarter of the world's 1 million expatriate Lithuanians, received a visa to attend the conference. But many other emigre activists were refused permits. Some claim that by this move, Soviet authorities were trying to drive a wedge into the Lithuanian emigre community. `` They -LRB- the people of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> -RRB- are after independence, but the Soviets only want the economic advantage of free enterprise. People expect more freedom than they'll get,'' said <PERSON> Ancietas </PERSON> <PERSON> Simiutis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s consul general-in-exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> absorbed the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in 1940 under a secret pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Nationalists denounced the pact, and several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, continue to recognize Baltic diplomats who maintain offices in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simiutis </PERSON> is one of many nationalists who are skeptical of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to reform the Soviet system and permit more openness about controversial issues. `` We think -LRB- Bieliauskas -RRB- is doing a good job, but -LRB- he -RRB- might be a bit naive because he expects more than the Soviets will give,'' <PERSON> Simiutis </PERSON> said. He said the Soviets need Bieliauskas to help legitimize their `` occupation'' and called his admission to the conference a `` Soviet trick.'' <PERSON> Bieliauskas </PERSON> responded that the Lithuanian organization's executive committee voted 8-1 in favor of him attending the conference `` -LRB- <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> -RRB- is occupied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but it does n't mean it does n't exist I deal with people, not with the government,'' <PERSON> Bieliauskas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bieliauskas </PERSON> said independence could be possible for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` But people are not ready. The process has just started. ... I believe in the process, but it will take time,'' he said. Klimaitis of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the older generation wants `` only the reconstruction of the Baltics of the 1918-1940 period -LRB- when they were independent -RRB-. But it looks like there are other possibilities ... more creative ideas for a new state,'' he said, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klimaitis </PERSON> envisioned the republics in a loose confederation with the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that would have control only over military and some foreign affairs. `` I think this will be possible,'' <PERSON> Klimaitis </PERSON> said, because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> realizes the region could become the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s `` big duty-free shop.'' Soviet Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> last week appeared to rule out independence for the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> republics </ORGANIZATION> by saying in a published interview that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would n't let the Baltic states conduct their own foreign affairs or print their own currency. But <PERSON> Bieliauskas </PERSON> maintains his hope for independence, pointing to a younger generation of activists in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klimaitis </PERSON> called the youth's participation the most encouraging sign he saw. `` They have had some days of real freedom, and they will never forget that.''

 The `` virus'' program that infected computers across the country was created by a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> whose father is one of the government's most respected computer security experts, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions Two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, a computer science graduate student whom friends describe as `` brilliant,'' wrote the set of computer instructions as an experiment. The student could not be reached for comment Friday, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s information technologies, said in a statement early Saturday that the university had not talked to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> but confirmed that he was a graduate student at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. `` We are investigating his computer files at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, and so far we have determined that his account contains files that appear to hold passwords for some computers at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> to which he is not entitled,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. `` We also have discovered that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' account contains a list of passwords substantially similar to those found in the virus.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said the university `` can not say whether or not he was responsible for this activity,'' adding: `` We've tried to reach him but he's not at home. Apparently he's left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He's apparently not in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> right now. Several telephone calls to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> senior's home in Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, went unanswered. Later, an answering machine was attached and there was no immediate response to requests for calls to be returned. The virus was introduced into the Arpanet, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> computer network, the Times said. It was intended to live there innocently and undetected, slowly making copies that would move from computer to computer, the report said. But a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out of control, ultimately jamming more than 6,000 computers nationwide. The virus apparently caused no damage other than the thousands of hours that computer scientists and programmers were spending to remove it from their systems. By Friday, universities and research centers turned their computers back on. Sources told the Times the younger <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday and is planning to hire a lawyer and meet with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in charge of the Arpanet network, to discuss the case. His father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, has written widely on the security of the Unix operating system, the computer master program that was the target of his son's virus program, of which, the sources said, he had no prior knowledge. The 56-year-old <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told the Times in a telephone interview Friday, that the virus was `` the work of a bored graduate student.'' He said his son was `` for his age very well trained in computer science: he studied it in college and held various summer jobs at various places.'' The Times reported Friday that an anonymous caller to the newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it got out of hand. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spoke in the presence of officials and lawyers of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and would not discuss the case in detail. He is chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> devoted to protecting computers against outside attack. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told the Times that he believed the virus might ultimately have a positive effect. `` It has raised the public awareness to a considerable degree,'' he said. `` It is likely to make people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in the future.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determine whether federal law had been violated. Contacted about the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> said he could add nothing beyond the prepared statement earlier in the day. `` As the matter is currently under investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it,'' <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> said.

 Actor <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowall </PERSON> has been star-crossed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <PERSON> McDowall </PERSON>, a child actor in `` My Friend Flicka'' and `` Lassie Come Home'' before moving on to grown-up movies like `` The Planet of the Apes'' and `` The Poseidon Adventure,'' was honored with a star on the famous walk in 1960.

 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pressed communist authorities to open negotiations with the opposition during her visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but also advised the opposition to act with restraint. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> prime minister, who returned home late Friday after a three-day visit, performed a balancing act in her meetings with government officials and leaders of the outlawed Solidarity union movment. She declared she had no intention of meddling in the country's internal affairs but then encouraged social strivings for greater freedom and human rights while urging the government to stay tough in restructuring its economy After her visit ended, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported public opinion polls showed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was viewed favorably by 52 percent of the Polish population, which it said made her more popular in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A `` poll of polls'' issued today by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> showed support in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at 47 percent, with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> second at 35 percent, and smaller groups trailing far behind. The poll covered the period of Oct. 19-30. Saying farewell Friday night to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist party leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> thanked him for allowing her to meet with different leaders. During her visit she went to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the birthplace of Solidarity, and met with Solidary founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as thousands of defiant people cheered her and hooted the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who arrived Wednesday, also spent hours in conversation with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, hearing their appeals for greater cooperation from the West in helping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> tackle its foreign debt problem. She was told the government is serious about economic and political reforms, and that the West should recognize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s achievements Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expressed sympathy for the goals, at one point telling <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> he was pursuing the same type of restructuring she had done in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. And she also told him he might have to endure criticism en route to success. She also seemed to express doubts about the pace of reforms and the government's attempts to set up talks with the opposition, while showing enthusiasm for Solidarity. She was the first Western leader to make the significant gesture of traveling to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to talk with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Solidarity was created at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> shipyards in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> in fall 1980 and became the first legally chartered free union movement in the Soviet bloc. In December 1981, the union was suspended and it was outlawed the next year by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> his `` leadership has achieved so much.'' `` I knew that I had to come and feel the spirit of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for myself,'' she told 20,000 Poles who gave her a sustained greeting outside the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> works as an electrician. The government announced Monday it would close the shipyard on Dec. 1. It said the subsidized state industry is losing money. Opponents called the decision a political attack on Solidarity. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> avoided commenting on the dispute, telling a news conference, `` That's not for me. It is for the people of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to decide.'' The official media gave the Thatcher visit heavy coverage but omitted mention of her meeting with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Solidarity leaders had hoped she would press authorities to `` recognize reality'' and again make Solidarity a legal organization. At a Thursday banquet given by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> she linked Western financial assistance to a government dialogue with the opposition and said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs political freedom to achieve economic progress. That pleased the opposition. `` It was beautiful what she said,'' a senior Solidarity adviser, historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, told reporters. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has a crippling $ 39 billion foreign debt. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said Friday night it was too early to assess the visit. Urban was asked about Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s suggestion that Western economic aid would be forthcoming if a `` real dialogue'' was undertaken with Solidarity. `` We are skeptical of such attempts to define conditions, and of such promises,'' he said.

 A severe earthquake rocked the <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> region in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> reported. The observatory said the quake occurred at 10:19 a.m., and registered a preliminary magnitude of 6.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The quake's epicenter was in the western region of <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION>, about 372 miles north of the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the observatory said. Further details were not immediately available. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas. A top-scale quake of magnitude 8 is a `` great'' earthquake, capable of tremendous damage in populated areas.

Even so, the three were among the would-be Sinatras, Madonnas and Elvises living out fantasies of being a singing star at a recent Record-A-Hit show at Choice's. Tuesday night patrons of the saloon can get up on stage, grab the microphone and sing along with tapes of hit songs recorded without the lead vocal. `` It makes you feel like a rock star once you loosen up,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON>, a college student. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, a bartender at another tavern, said, `` You can be anybody you want to be up there. It's a fantasy.'' The singers get a free tape of their performance, said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Broms </PERSON>, a former sales manager who saw a similar audience participation show in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 2 -LCB- years ago and founded Record-A-Hit in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Record-A-Hit sets up shop at five different Chicago-area nightclubs each week. The company also does private functions, special video tapings and even goes on band tours. The concept is big business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where it is known as `` karaoke,'' or `` empty orchestra.'' `` Everything is free for the customer except the beer,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Asta </PERSON>, Choice's owner. `` This really helps my place's Tuesday blahs, with bigger crowds.'' Record-A-Hit offers over 600 selections _ songs from the 1930s to the 1980s. `` I pick songs whose words I'm familar with,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Drzal </PERSON>, a computer programming trainee. Singers get plenty of help _ copies of lyrics, tips on vocalizing, echoes and other electronic effects, backup singers and props like sunglasses and cowboy hats. Master of ceremonies <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> coaxes people on stage like a carnival barker. `` Make a tape. They're great little stocking stuffers for Christmas,'' he implored. The show attracts an occasional Elvis or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> impersonator. At Choice's one Tuesday, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, who works for Record-A-Hit, did Presley's `` I Ca n't Help Falling In Love With You.'' `` Than' you, you're boo-ful,'' he kept telling the crowd, a la Elvis. `` Gee, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> lives,'' yelled <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a former professional singer and current <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> supervisor who had done <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s `` Summer Wind'' earlier. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternberg </PERSON> did a rousing `` Hello Dolly'' in a raspy <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> voice. Some are kidded for their performances. When <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> finished singing `` Boardwalk,'' his brother, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, told the audience, `` <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>'s supposed to be at a church meeting tonight. I want to see how he's going to take this tape home and play it for his wife.'' Although the crowd of about 50 people heard some less-than-tuneful crooners, there were n't any catcalls. Particularly off pitch was <PERSON> Sternberg </PERSON>, a 35-year-old lawyer who sang <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s `` My Way.'' `` His voice is like fingernails on a chalk board,'' offered <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouton </PERSON>, a college student. <PERSON> Sternberg </PERSON>'s own brother, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, agreed. `` He ca n't carry a tune in a suitcase,'' he said.

 The new Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said his country may increase aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We support the Sandinista Revolution with all our heart,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikolayenko </PERSON>, said Friday in his first news conference since presenting credentials to President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Oct. 28. `` There could be an increase -LRB- in aid -RRB- as a result of the additional needs of the Nicaraguan people,'' <PERSON> Nikoloyenko </PERSON> said, apparently referring to the destruction caused last month by Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Girl Hit By Lawn Dart Says She's Lucky To Survive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An 11-year-old girl recovering from injuries sustained when a lawn dart lodged in her brain said it was good news to hear that federal regulators last week banned the sale of the game. The one-pound, metal-tipped dart penetrated about two inches into <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herron </PERSON>'s skull Oct. 25. <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> doctors said she probably saved herself from bleeding to death by leaving it there as she went to her mother for help. `` I did n't pull it out because I thought it might hurt,'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> said Friday in a conversation with reporters. The girl, awake and alert and wondering when she would be allowed to go home, had been placed in a drug-induced coma for several days after surgery to minimize damage from the swelling of her brain by reducing brain activity. Recounting to reporters how she was injured, she said, `` We was playing darts to start with, and they started throwing them up in the air as far as they could throw them.'' She said some of her companions were trying to catch the darts as they came down. `` I did n't want to play and I started to go back home and I did n't see them throw it, but they threw it and I looked up and it hit me in the head,'' she said. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, her stepfather, said he was unaware of the circumstances of <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s injury as she described it. `` We're going to have to check into that,'' he said. Previously, the family thought <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> was struck by a dart thrown toward a ring on the ground _ the proper way to play the game, which is similar to horseshoes. Doctors have told <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> she may be released from the hospital by Wednesday. `` They say I'll have to stay home for a while _ that I wo n't be able to go back to school for a while _ but mother is looking into the possibility of getting a teacher to come by the house,'' said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, who was listed in fair condition Friday. The injury caused problems with her vision, but otherwise left her unscathed, the <LOCATION> McMinnville </LOCATION> girl said. `` When I look at the elevator and try to push the button, it looks like it's way over there, but it's right here in front of me,'' she said. `` That's the only change I've noticed. It's the only thing I ca n't do very well now that I could do before.'' Doctors have not commented on whether <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> suffered brain damage or can expect any long-term problems from the accident. `` We have been very pleased at this point with her situation and are very hopeful for a full recovery,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenkopf </PERSON>, her neurosurgeon. `` Her major asset is her age. I would rather be young than old if I had to recover from anything _ including a hangover.'' Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted to ban the sale of lawn darts and said the game probably would be off store shelves by Christmas. The darts have been blamed for at least three deaths and several thousand injuries in recent years. The ban did not include a recall, and commission member <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> asked the public to keep the darts out of children's hands.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a list of recommendations for computer users for virus prevention and control. It was drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LAN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and approved this week by more than 60 companies: 1. All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources. 2. All purchased software should be in its original shrink wrap or sealed diskette containers when received. 3. Back-up copies of all original software should be made as soon as the software package is opened. Back-up copies should be stored off-site. 4. All software should be reviewed carefully, by a system manager, before it is installed on a computer network. 6. New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer. This testing will greatly reduce the risk of system virus contamination. 7. A back-up copy of all system software and data should be made at least once a month, with the back-up copy stored for at least one year before re-use. This will allow restoration of a system that has been contaminated by a `` time-released'' virus. A plan that includes `` grandfathered'' rotation of back-up copies will reduce risk even further. 8. System administrators should restrict access to system programs and data on a `` need-to-use'' basis. This isolates problems, protects critical applications, and aids problem diagnosis. 9. All programs on a system should be checked regularly for program length changes. Any program-length deviations could be evidence of tampering, or virus infiltration. 10. Many shared or free programs are invaluable. However, these are the prime entry point for viruses. Skeptical review of such programs is prudent. Also, extended quarantine is essential before these programs are introduced to a computer system. 11. Any software that exhibits symptoms of possible virus contamination should be removed immediately. System managers should develop plans for quick removal of all copies of a suspect program, and immediate backup of all related data. These plans should be made known to all users, and tested and reviewed periodically.

 A witness testified at the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> that during the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> calmly said `` this is the man we killed'' while looking at a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON>, a German-born American citizen who was on the hijacked airliner, also said Friday that he received a mysterious telephone call recently in which a caller identified himself as a `` Mr. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>.'' `` About four weeks ago I got a telephone call. I thought it was kind of strange,'' <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> said. `` The man on the other end of the line said ` Hello Mr. <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON>.''' `` I said, ` Who's this?,' and he said, ` Mr. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. This is <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> calling,''' <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> testified. He said the man then hung up without mentioning <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> was not further questioned about the call and did not say if he thought it was a threat. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> comes from a family of 11 children. An older brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, is security chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for the fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party of God -RRB- organization. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder, air piracy and other crimes in the hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage 17 days and a 23-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, <PERSON> Rogert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, was killed in the ordeal. <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> caused a stir in the courtroom when he produced a Lebanese newspaper, An-Nahar, dated June 16, 1985, two days after <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 was seized on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The newspaper's account of the hijacking then in progress at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport included photographs of the hijacked plane and a photograph of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s body lying on the tarmac. <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had been reading the newspaper aboard the plane and when `` I asked him what was in it, he said, ` This is the man we killed.' I asked him, ` Did you shoot him?''' `` He said, ` No, my friend shot him,''' <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> testified. `` He said it very nonchalantly, like it was no big deal.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He blamed the killing on his accomplice, identified by court documents as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>. In another conversation on the hijacked plane, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, and had been trained in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> previously denied being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Lebanese Shiite group backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Another former American hostage, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Willet </PERSON>, testified Friday and confirmed statements by earlier witnesses that the hijackers brutally beat the passengers. Under guidelines set by the court to protect the witnesses' security, neither witness named his current residence At the time of the hijacking, <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON>'s address was given as <LOCATION> Lunenburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Willet </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Choupic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> declined comment on Friday's testimony. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s Lebanese parents arrived Friday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to testify next Tuesday, when the trial resumes, about their son's childhood in war-torn <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in January 1987 as he tried to smuggle liquid explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 An intelligence-gathering satellite capable of spying on 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be carried by the secret space shuttle mission scheduled for late this month, an industry magazine reports. `` When fully deployed, the spacecraft will have a span as large as 150 feet,'' Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. `` It has the characteristics of an imaging radar or optical reconnaissance involving digital imaging, or both. `` The radar transmission is designed to penetrate cloud cover and would be valuable in both ocean and land surveillance,'' the magazine said in its Nov. 7 issue, available Friday. Space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew will be flying the third classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shuttle mission, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> have cloaked most details about it in secrecy. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> processing director <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> said the agency was aiming for launch on Nov. 28 or 29. Aviation Week said the satellite will be launched into an orbit that will enable it to look down on 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. At least three of the 27 earlier shuttle missions flew over the same Soviet territory. The magazine said the satellite will be dropped overboard from the cargo bay by an astronaut using the craft's 50-foot robot arm. Two astronauts are prepared to take a space walk in case there is trouble deploying the satellite. Aviation Week said estimates of the cost of the satellite, filled with advanced-technology equipment, range as high as $ 500 million. It said the satellite could be retrieved on a later shuttle mission and returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for improvements. Sources who insisted on anonymity earlier told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Atlantis would carry an intelligence-gathering satellite that would help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials verify that the Soviets were complying with arms control treaties. The sources also said the astronauts will conduct several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer in space. The tests would involve coordination with troop and ship movements and missile launchings on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The space shuttle program resumed Sept. 29 with the successful launch of Discovery, the first shuttle launched since the fatal explosion of the shuttle Challenger in January 1986. During the hiatus, the Pentagon relied on conventional rockets to send military payloads into space.

<HEAD>Study Finds Widespread Discrimination In Hiring Those Who Might Be

<TEXT>
 Employers in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are engaging in widespread discrimination against legalized aliens and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who appear to be foreigners, the first such study of its kind in the nation has found. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Immigration Affairs said much of the discrimination apparently stemmed from the Immigration and Reform Act of 1986, which offered amnesty to eligible aliens up to May 4 and then imposed stiffer fines and other sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens. The study, begun last month, looked at 400 private employers in the metropolitan region selected from more than 130,000 private employers who have more than 4 million people working for them, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. By extrapolating from the data gathered from those 400, the study found that more than 22,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens or aliens who were authorized to work had been at least temporarily denied employment. In their responses, employers indicated confusion about the legislation or fear of sanctions, the Times said. The panel that conducted the study found that employers discriminated by refusing to accept legally valid proof of residency, by denying employment to those who experience minor delays in gathering documentation, and by screening out those applicants who look or sound foreign. Of the employers surveyed, 7 percent admitted they had engaged in `` selective screening'' or had placed more stringent requirements on job applicants who seemed `` risky'' under the new sanctions. The federal <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which is required by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to report evidence of employer discrimination stemming from the immigration law, is expected to release its annual report Monday.

 Although computer viruses have caused little damage so far, they ultimately may slow the computer revolution by requiring the introduction of safeguards that make the machines less convenient and accessible. `` What I think it does is spell the end of the user-friendly era,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> tenEyck </PERSON>, telecommunications director of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` The brave new world of computing, I think, is still becoming a reality. But there's a -LRB- need for a -RRB- gatekeeper,'' he said Friday. A computer virus is a program that `` infects'' other programs by modifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from one computer to another and alter or destroy data. Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone lines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a computer. A virus that swept the country this week temporarily crippled the computing centers of many universities and research centers. Business began to return to normal Friday as computer operators cleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplying program. In attempts to control viruses, there will be much stricter limits on who can use certain programs and data bases and under what conditions. This will make it harder for people to work together in computer networks. New pieces of software, no matter how seemingly beneficial, will be tested at length, especially if they come from insecure sources. Certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will be run every time someone sits down to use a piece of software, causing frustrating delays. There could even be delays in everyday activities such as using a credit card. In short, steps to protect against computer viruses may drain computers of two of their most important attributes: speed and accessibility. Even with time-consuming and expensive precautions, viruses will remain a problem. Once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almost impossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has been eradicated, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Chruscicki </PERSON>, program manager for system reliability at a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, institute that performs studies for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Some people have expressed concern that the danger of computer viruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computers were mainframes in locked `` glass houses,'' operated by people in white coats. Ms. <PERSON> Chruscicki </PERSON> said she does not think that will happen. `` The world of information is here and computer users do n't want to go back to where they're sheltered from what's out there, whether it's a low-cost product or a free product,'' she said. `` The key issue is that with proper precautions, one can continue to live a normal existence,'' said <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the National LAN Laboratory in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. More than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelines drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LAN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> that are intended to prevent and control viruses Among the recommendations: _ All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources _ New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer for testing _ Back-up copies of all master software and computer data should be made at least once a month so the back-ups can be used if the current versions are corrupted by a virus `` It's very much like the AIDS virus: The best solution is precaution,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says it is studying whether a nationwide computer `` virus'' attack on a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> computer network broke federal law. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Friday a criminal investigation would be launched if a preliminary inquiry determined that federal law had been violated. The bureau will review the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which deals with unauthorized access to government computers or computers in two or more states. If records within the computer systems that were `` infected'' are found to have been destroyed or harmed, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> could conduct a full-scale investigation, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The virus is an unauthorized computer program that officials this week said reproduced in computers nationwide and apparently instructed them to send copies of itself to other machines through a research network, Arpanet. Although there was no apparent damage, computers were turned off as they became overloaded with material. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that the virus program was created by a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, whose father is one of the government's most respected computer security experts Two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> wrote the set of computer instructions as an experiment. The virus was intended to live in the Arpanet undetected, slowly making copies that would move from computer to computer, the report said. But a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out of control, ultimately jamming more than 6,000 computers nationwide. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for information technologies, said early today the university had not talked to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> but was investigating his computer files. `` So far we have determined that his account contains files that appear to hold passwords for some computers at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> to which he is not entitled,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We also have discovered that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' account contains a list of passwords substantially similar to those found in the virus.'' Passwords are the codes needed to gain access to computer systems. The <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, school scheduled a news conference for today. Several telephone calls to the family's home in Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, went unanswered. Later, an answering machine was attached and messages left on it were not returned. The younger <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> also could not be reached. The university said it did not have a local address for him, and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said college officials believed he was on his way to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Arpanet, established by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is used by researchers and defense contractors to share data. Officials said the virus also spread into some government computers, from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, computer security officer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClary </PERSON> said the virus had caused no damage but a few hundred scientists suffered delays in their work. Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colladay </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing the virus had been defeated in roughly 24 hours' time after being spotted Wednesday evening. He said the Pentagon was confident the computer network had resumed normal operations. `` It was a benign virus; by that I mean it did n't destroy files,'' Colladay said. Colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use the system had concluded the virus program _ while fairly sophisticated _ did not contain any `` Trojan horse'' bug that could crop up again at a later time. <PERSON> Colladay </PERSON> said he had ordered a new study by his agency of the security procedures used by Arpanet. He said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials purposely had designed the network as an `` open'' system and deliberately rejected various security procedures in the past on cost grounds. Colladay and Col. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON>, the manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said the Arpanet differed significantly from the computer networks that handle classified military information. <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON> said there was never any danger or possibility the virus could have jumped from the Arpanet to a classified system. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits gaining access to a `` federal interest computer without authorization'' and engaging in conduct which `` alters, damages or destroys information.'' Conviction carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. One of the definitions of a federal interest computer is one of two or more computers used in committing an offense which are not all situated in the same state.

 A computer `` vaccine'' that would block the invasion of a computer virus like the one that swept the nation this week is under development by scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>' computer security officer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClary </PERSON> said two main efforts are under way to guard against future viral attacks, both `` using computers more to get to people who are attacking computers.'' `` The first is to use computers to guard computers against viruses _ enhanced intrusion detection techniques that let you look for unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computer system,'' he said Friday. `` The other approach ... is to develop anti-viral code _ vaccines, if you like, to carry the analogy further _ that amount to self-examining code, so the code itself will know if someone makes an unauthorized change to it.'' Computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenient for researchers at universities and research centers, but did no known permanent damage and did not enter classified computers. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the virus was created by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' father, chief scientist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the virus could `` make people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in the future. The younger <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> McClary </PERSON> said scientists at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, a federal nuclear weapons research center, were able to identify the virus and cleanse it from the lab's system. `` The most useful aspect of these sort of events is that they occur in an unclassified, non-sensitive environment that lets us look at the techniques used to introduce these viruses,'' said <PERSON> McClary </PERSON>. The virus infiltrated the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> network that links computers at scientific laboratories nationwide, infecting <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, its sister <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and numerous other government and private research centers. `` This is the largest-scale virus attack that I have seen that was distributed across the country,'' <PERSON> McClary </PERSON> said. A computer virus is a program that `` infects'' other programs by modifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from one computer to another and alter or destroy data. This virus did its damage by making repeated copies of itself, slowing computer processing and eating up computer memory space. Viruses usually are communicated by data transmission over phone lines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a computer. <PERSON> McClary </PERSON> said scientists working at remote terminals, all using the Unix operating system, began experiencing delays in gaining access to their research data late Wednesday. He said he believes the first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered the computers. Thursday morning, laboratory scientists disconnected the access route of the virus, the electronic mail system by which scientific data is transmitted among research institutions, he said. Later that morning, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> informed the lab the computer virus existed. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> and the other laboratories will analyze the virus code to determine its source, <PERSON> McClary </PERSON> said. `` What they'll have to do is follow each path that they're able to pick up at some point and go back along that path,'' he said. `` Generally, you can trace back. We do n't know yet enough about this one. This one does a fair job of cleaning up after itself.''

<TEXT>
 An earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale struck a thinly populated region of western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported. The bureau said the quake hit the <LOCATION> Tanggula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> range along the border of <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> at 10:14 a.m. It said the epicenter was near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 310 miles north of the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, in the snow-covered <LOCATION> Tanggula </LOCATION> range. Peaks in the region, inhabited mainly by nomads, rise to 19,680 feet above sea level. An official at the bureau, contacted by telephone, said there was no information about damage or injuries and efforts were being made to contact the seismological bureau in <LOCATION> Xining </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> capital. The Richter Scale measures the total strength of an earthquake as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number represents a tenfold increase in magnitude. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. A quake measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale could cause devastating damage in a populated area. A top-scale quake of magnitude 8 is a `` great'' earthquake, capable of tremendous damage in populated areas.

 Ten years ago, when <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> paid $ 7,500 for a parking space on tony <PERSON> Beacon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, some of his friends thought he was nuts. But this year, two spots in the same garage changed hands for $ 135,000 each _ and 10 more buyers put their names on a waiting list. So who's nuts now? `` I'd say it looks like it was a pretty good investment,'' <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said. `` Would n't you?'' Of course, not all parking in this city is so expensive. A space in the garage under the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> goes for $ 110 a month. All you have to do is sign up and wait your turn _ which, at the present rate, would come in about seven years, according to the state agency that runs the 1,500-car garage. While prices on <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the wait at the Common may be extreme examples, there is no question that parking has become expensive, time-consuming and frustrating in downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. On an average day, according to a recent study by the city's transportation department, 99 percent of the spaces in the financial district are filled by 10 a.m. By noon, the occupancy rate rises to 102 percent _ the extra 2 percent reflecting illegally parked vehicles While many major cities have similar problems, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s is particularly acute, because the parking supply has been frozen since 1973, when the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a state environmental agency set a cap of 35,500 spaces in an effort to control smog. Only a few cities have such caps _ others include neighboring <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> _ and in the face of public exasperation, the city is preparing to seek a partial reprieve. Early next year, said Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimino </PERSON>, the city will present a plan calling for the addition of 5,000 spaces. In addition, the city is trying to encourage car and van pools by reserving spaces for them in municipal garages. And it is looking to build new garages in outlying areas. To get the new spaces, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> will have to prove to the environmental agencies that lifting the cap `` would not make the air quality situation any worse, and, preferably, would make an improvement,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwetz </PERSON>, a state air pollution regulator. To a large extent, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s parking problem is a matter of simple geography: Downtown covers less than 2 square miles, and is bound by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to the west and the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the north and east. But the crunch also has been exacerbated by a building boom in which high-rent office buildings have drawn more workers and, in some cases, supplanted parking lots or garages. City officials contend that there is no lack of parking enforcement. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s corps of parking officers has jumped almost 50 percent in the last year, from 65 to 95, and the city has been issuing tickets at the rate of 150,000 a month. Still, a $ 15 ticket can seem cheap compared to the price of parking in a garage. According to the transportation department, the average hourly rate across the city is $ 3.60, but in some areas, like the <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, it goes as high as $ 6. Already, several of the city's largest companies _ including <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> _ formed an organization named <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> that broke ground last month for a 1,400-car underground garage in the heart of the financial district. A good measure of the value of downtown parking was provided by the organization's sale of 450 shares of preferred stock in the garage. Each share entitles the owner to rent a space in the garage for the regular monthly fee, expected to be about $ 340. All 450 shares were sold in advance _ for $ 65,000 each.

 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to recognize a 3,500-member union at the school after a bitter, 13-year organizing drive. Adopting a conciliatory tone, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> said Friday the university decided against appealing a judge's recent ruling that the union won a fair election in May. `` With this decision, and the expected certification -LRB- of the union -RRB- by the -LRB- National Labor Relations -RRB- Board, we will commence a new chapter in our relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> said. `` I will work to make this relationship as constructive and harmonious as possible.'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> administrator responsible for union relations, said the university hurriedly printed up several thousand `` We'll Make It Work'' buttons in the school colors of crimson and white, and handed them out to coincide with <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>'s announcement. `` I hope people see this as a positive statement by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> about how we're going to approach this situation, because that's the way it was intended,'' she said. The union drive, which began in 1975, was viewed by national labor leaders as a test case for organizing white-collar workers. `` <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>'s statement is the most respectful gesture that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> could have made to its employees right now,'' said union organizer <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, with its main campus in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, and the union have agreed to 60 days of informal talks before entering contract negotiations, <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON> said. The union, which represents non-professional employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> college, is affiliated with the 1.1 million-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees. Noting that 83 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> union's members are women, <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> victory is enormous and broadly meaningful _ and will help women in work places all over the country.'' The union won the May 17 election by a margin of 1,530 to 1,486. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> filed a series of legal objections to the vote, contending that union organizers kept track of voters at the polls and used coercive tactics. After hearings in August, an administrative law judge issued a strongly worded decision Oct. 24 dismissing <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s objections.

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s national airline established two firsts by ordering advanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft and planning to offer two classes of service in the new jets. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will sell three 767 wide-body jets to <ORGANIZATION> LOT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, marking the first time a Soviet bloc nation has purchased modern, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> jets. The deal, announced Friday, is worth $ 220 million to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the engine supplier. LOT also said it would offer business - and economy-class service on the jets Only one class of service currently is offered on the Soviet-made aircraft that make up LOT's 45-plane fleet. The state-owned airline said the three jets would be used on flights linking <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. It said they should help double its traffic between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as early as next year. The moves were seen as the first attempt by an Eastern bloc airline to compete with Western concerns for Western passengers, particularly business travelers, who pay higher fares but also demand a high level of service. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials said they hoped the deal, though relatively small, would lead to more deals with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other Soviet bloc nations. `` We're very proud and pleased that we were selected. It's a major breakthrough for us,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillinga </PERSON>, director of sales for Central and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said it will be the first to deliver modern, wide-body jets made in the West to a Soviet bloc nation because it will deliver its first two planes to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> consortium delivers two A-310s to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> under a previously announced deal <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> will deliver two 767-200s in April and May 1989 and one 767-300 in June 1990. All will be extended-range models, powered by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> CF6-80C2 engines. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> declined to specify how the $ 220 million price was split between <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and GE. Although <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has a desperate shortage of hard currency to buy Western goods, the airline is an exception because it brings in hard currencies every time it flies to the West. That made the financing relatively easy. In a deal financed by unspecified Western banks, LOT will lease the airplanes and engines for 12 years, at the end of which it will own them, <PERSON> Hillinga </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will be paid by the banks. LOT said it will use the jetliners on its routes between <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Later, <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> will be added.

 Five black police officers filed a $ 55 million federal lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, alleging the department `` intentionally mistreats its black officers.'' The filing of the suit Thursday came less than two months after the 207-member <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firefighters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> filed another discrimination suit against the city. Both lawsuits claim that longstanding discrimination by white supervisors prevented black officers from advancing. The city denied the firefighters' charges. First Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON> said Friday he had not yet seen the pleadings in the latest lawsuit. `` It'd be inappropriate for me to comment at this time,'' he said.

It also requests class-action status to include all of the estimated 300 black officers on the 3,100-member force. `` We realize we're going to receive some criticism from white officers, and also some of the black officers,'' said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and one of the five plaintiffs. `` A lot of young black officers are not familiar with problems that have gone on in the past.'' City Councilwoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> agreed that black officers face discrimination. `` The concerns are quite legitimate,'' said <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>, who is black. The police department has been criticized this year for its use of deadly force and its relations with minority communities. The issue came to a head in January when a white officer was shot in the face three times with his own gun by a black homeless man described as mentally ill. Two witnesses said the shooter was urged on by a few young black men who yelled: `` Shoot him, shoot him!

 Two men acquitted of kidnapping and conspiracy charges for abducting a <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> member and trying to `` deprogram'' her were relieved by the verdict and said they would continue to work with cult members. `` I think -LRB- the verdict -RRB- is telling people there is such a thing as coercive persuasion and saying people have the right to religious freedom. Cults take those rights away from people,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. He and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandyberry </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were acquitted Friday after six hours of deliberation. <PERSON> Brandyberry </PERSON>, who cried after the verdict, and <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> said they would continue their work in some way. Using the rare `` choice-of-evils'' defense, the men contended their actions were permissible because they intended to `` rescue'' the woman from a greater evil, the Rev. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. They were charged with second-degree kidnapping and conspiracy in the May 26, 1987, abduction of <PERSON> Britta </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfsson </PERSON>, 30, from a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> street. The defendants had faced two to eight years in prison for kidnapping and one to four years for conspiracy. `` This is a rescue, ladies and gentlemen, not a kidnapping,'' <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said in closing arguments Thursday. `` What <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> did was a necessary emergency measure to avoid permanent injury.'' <PERSON> Tord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margit </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfsson </PERSON>, the woman's parents, paid the defendants about $ 8,000 to abduct and deprogram their daughter because they thought she was going to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to participate in a second `` mass marriage.'' The Swedish woman's 1982 marriage, performed during a mass wedding ceremony by the church, ended in divorce in 1985. Deprogramming entails persuading a person to abandon rigid commitment to certain values or beliefs of a cult by undoing the effects of indoctrination. Prosecutors argued that <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, a private detective, and <PERSON> Brandyberry </PERSON>, a deprogrammer and ex-Unification Church leader, were motivated by money and hatred for the organization. Moreover, the defendants created the `` emergency'' by playing on the family's unfounded fear that the woman was being brainwashed and on the brink of marriage, they said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagliuca </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brandyberry </PERSON>'s lawyer, said <PERSON> Adolfsson </PERSON>, although 29 at the time of the abduction, was `` a naive little school girl'' when she came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979 as an exchange student and was lured into the cult in 1980. <PERSON> Britta </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfsson </PERSON> had said she was terrified by the abduction, which ended when she escaped from a <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, house by jumping through a second-story window. She remains a <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> member. Unification Church President <PERSON> Mose </PERSON> <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said the judge erred in allowing the case to be tried. `` To put a religion on trial is to contradict everything in the Constitution. The ramifications of this are horrible, especially for minority religions,'' <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said.

 A leading television network went to court today demanding prosecutors return seized videotapes allegedly showing a businessman offering bribes to a lawmaker involved in a stock trading scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, investigating the alleged bribery case, seized four master tapes from the <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Kyoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokiwa </PERSON>, a network official, told a news conference today his company filed a complaint in <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeking an injunction against the seizure that he said `` violates freedom of the press as guaranteed by the constitution.'' The videotapes contain scenes, some broadcast by the network, that reportedly show <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> official, offering cash packets to <PERSON> Yanosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>, an opposition party member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> has been a leader of a parliamentary probe into a scandal involving the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares to dozens of politicial leaders and other prominent people at bargain prices before the stocks were publicly traded. When the shares were listed on the over-the-counter market in 1986, they quickly rose in value and the purchasers made large profits. Network officials said they made the videotapes with <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>'s cooperation after he told them <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> tried several times to bribe him $ 40,000 to tone down his investigation The tapes reportedly were made with a hidden camera Aug. 30 and Sept. 3 at <LOCATION> Narazaki </LOCATION>'s residence near <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. After some scenes were aired, <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> was arrested Oct. 20 and charged with attempted bribery. Top politicians, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, say they were not directly involved but that aides bought the shares. Opposition officials and newspaper reports say at least 140 people and more than 1.2 million Recruit-Cosmos shares were involved. Government officials have said the stock sales were not illegal unless they involved political or other favors in return. But the case has raised ethical questions about links between business and politics in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Opposition parties say <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, founder of Recruit-Cosmos' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, offered the unlisted shares to politicians, business leaders and others in exchange for privileges and special favors for his company

<TEXT>
 A law giving Orthodox rabbis sole authority over conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> stands a good chance of being passed by the new parliament, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast today. The so-called `` Who Is A Jew'' law has been denounced as discriminatory by American Jews. More than 80 percent of the 6 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews who are affiliated to congregations belong to Reform or Conservative movements. The law is a key demand of four Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox religious parties engaged in coalition talks with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc after Tuesday's general election <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and needs the 18 seats of the religious parties to form a majority government that would also include extreme right-wing parties. Sixty-one seats are needed to govern. The `` Who Is A Jew'' law does not appear to be a sticking point in the coalition talks. Most Likud legislators, including <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, voted for the proposed law when it was last put to a vote in 1987. At the time it was narrowly defeated. `` If there are now more <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members who agree to this -LRB- the law -RRB- there are more chances that it will pass,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return, which grants automatic citizenship to all Jews, defines Jews as those born to a Jewish mother or converted to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. The amendment demanded by the Orthodox would change the definition to read: `` Converted according to Orthodox Jewish law.'' Although the law would not disqualify most Conservative or Reform Jews, movement leaders have said it would symbolically expel them from the Jewish fold and alienate them from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> dismissed such concerns. `` Before every vote on some religious law, there is a big noise among American Jews,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think there is a lot of exaggeration. I'm convinced we'll reach some understanding with the American Jews. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also sought to allay fears by secular Israelis that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would give in to blackmail by the religious parties that demand a ban on driving, movies and soccer on the <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>. `` I do n't foresee any decisive chances,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` Everyone will be able to continue to live as he does now.'' He did not specify which demands by the religious parties the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would reject or accept. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reiterated that he rejected demands by potential extreme right-wing coalition partners to annex the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and to expel the 1.5 million Palestinians living there. He told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> stuck by the 1978 Camp David accords, which says the final status of the occupied lands should be determined by negotiations between the parties to the conflict. Despite the differences, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was confident he could put together a coalition soon. `` Certainly, it will not be easy, but a government will be formed,'' he said. The left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 39 seats, also held coalition talks with the religious parties, but its chances of forming a government are seen as slim. Many top Labor officials have urged party leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to stop the negotiations and accept a role in the opposition.

<HEAD>Metropolitan General Manager Announces Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The general manager of the Metropolitan Opera surprised the company with his announcement that he will step down to become chief executive officer of a New York-based corporation. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 59, announced Friday that he will quit as of April 1 but will remain on the board of directors and executive committee. In an interview published in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, he denied that there had been any limitations on his authority or personality clashes. He said he had resigned solely because of the appeal of his new position. He would not disclose his new employer's name. `` There is nothing that the Met could have done in light of the opportunity that has presented itself to me,'' he said. The Met learned of <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s decision during its Friday morning rehearsal of `` Carmen,'' when an announcement was posted, said <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman. `` I think everybody is extremely surprised. It was totally unexpected,'' she said. As administrative head of the opera company, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has been credited with stabilizing it financially and artistically. <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON> noted that he has `` increased the box office percentage and reduced the deficit.'' In 1983-84, the season before <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> became president of the company, the Met ran a deficit after contributions of $ 8 million. In the last two seasons it has essentially broken even. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, president of the Met board, said, `` While we're very sorry <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> is resigning as general manager, we understand his desire to return to the corporate world. She said the executive committee would form a search committee to look for a successor. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> left his position as chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> BBDO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the sixth-largest advertising company in the world, to become the Met's general manager. The Times said <PERSON> Cawford </PERSON> received a salary of $ 750,000 at <ORGANIZATION> BBDO </ORGANIZATION>, according to proxy statements. The newspaper said Met officials would not reveal his salary as general manager but did not deny reports that it was about $ 300,000.

 An ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> policeman has been sentenced to five years in jail for assaulting a Serbian Orthodox nun in ethnically troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province, newspapers reported today. The district court of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, capital of the southern province, ruled Friday that policeman <PERSON> Ahmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ljatifi </PERSON> on Aug. 28 `` physically attacked'' <PERSON> Abess </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatjana </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Gracanica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> monastery, the Politika daily reported. <PERSON> Tatjana </PERSON>, in her early sixties, said in a recent interview that the policeman, in his early thirties, grabbed her that night in the monastery yard, threatening to rape her. She said she managed to free herself. The attack `` has triggered anxiety'' among the Serbian minority in the province, the newspaper quoted the court as saying. The court added <PERSON> Ljatifi </PERSON> was aware of what he was doing, even though he was `` under slight influence of alcohol.'' Thousands of Serbs protested near the monastery after the incident. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Slav minority claims it is being harassed, intimidated and forced to leave the region by ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the province's population. The majority of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Albanians are Moslems, compared to the mostly Orthodox Serbs and Montenegrins.

 Staffers of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers expressed dismay over the resignation of their top editor, who cited a lack of `` shared values and mutual trust'' with the newspapers' senior management <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, who left the top post at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau to take over the Journal and Constitution in December 1986, announced his resignation Friday Stunned staffers then gathered 119 signatures on a petition urging Publisher <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to reconsider his acceptance of <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s resignation And a full-page advertisement in today's combined editions of the papers _ which are essentially one newspaper with different editorial pages _ was purchased and signed by 123 of the paper's approximately 400 staffers It said they were `` deeply saddened by the sudden resignation of Editor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>. We are disturbed that it was so readily accepted.'' According to a story in Friday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` An irreconcilable difference in management styles surfaced in a discussion Friday morning.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that although he and <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> were `` in accord philosophically over the direction the newspapers have taken,'' the management difference caused him to accept the editor's resignation. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said his resignation brought to an end `` two years of effort to develop a set of shared values and mutual trust with the senior managers of the company. ... It became clear this week that no such relationship existed.'' Exactly what precipitated Friday morning's developments was unclear. Neither the Journal's story nor <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s statement went into detail. But according to today's edition of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, some staffers suggested that the newspapers' management had been under pressure to rein in <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> because of his aggressive business-news coverage. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> reportedly riled some of the city's most highly visible corporate citizens with articles that included descriptions of discriminatory lending practices in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s poorest neighborhoods.

He acknowledged that he and <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> differed on several issues, including control of the newspapers' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau and the amount of money to be committed to covering news. He said the budget dispute was settled several weeks ago, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> declined to comment on whether their dispute over control of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau was related to <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s resignation.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s decision to suspend its troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> violates the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and raises doubts about <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s commitment to end the war, a top Pakistani official said today. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> announced the suspension Friday and said it sent advanced weapons to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because of unrelenting pressure from Moslem guerrillas. Witnesses have reported seeing MiG-27 jets and SS-1 Scud missiles in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets also accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> withdrawal agreement by sending arms to the insurgents. The Soviet actions reflected <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s frustration over how the Afghan army has handled the fight in the nearly three months since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reached the halfway point in withdrawning its estimated 115,000 men. The announcement Friday appeared to indicate the Soviet withdrawal might not be completed by the Feb. 15 deadline set in the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The withdrawal began May 15. `` The decision of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to suspend further withdrawals of its troops is a matter of concern and disappointment,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said in a statement today. The suspension and the new <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons represent `` a violation of the letter and spirit of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements and are incompatible with the understanding that the only military activity to be undertaken by Soviet forces would be in defense of their withdrawing troops,'' <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. He called the escalation of Soviet military activity a form of `` support of the desparate and isolated <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime.'' <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, has recently come under heavy missile attacks by the guerrillas. Soviet forces intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to replace one fledgling Marxist government with another.

 Indian and <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> military officers negotiated on the high seas today with foreign mercenaries who fled the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> in a boat with about 18 hostages after failing to overthrow the government. `` We have started talking,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` We have not yet reached any conclusion. There are many lives involved. There are threats to life.'' The major gave only one name. The negotiations began after two Indian warships halted the boat with the mercenaries and their hostages. At sundown today, the talks were still under way, said A.K. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON>, the Indian high commissioner in Male, the capital. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> said that out of concern for the hostages' safety soldiers refrained from boarding the boat, whose location he declined to reveal. `` We fear that the mercenaries may harm the hostages, so we want to be cautious,'' he said. The mercenaries' boat was intercepted en route to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, said an Indian general who helped rescue besieged President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> after the attempted coup Thursday on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation. Maldivian officials and foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> said the mercenaries were thought to be Sri Lankan Tamil guerrillas. The general, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the mercenaries' boat escaped from Male on Friday after Indian paratroopers reached the Maldivian capital The <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> is 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and more than 600 miles west of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON>, whose rank is equivalent to ambassador, said between 27 and 32 people died in the attempted coup. `` This figure may be understated because the mercenaries may have removed their dead,'' he said. He gave no breakdown of the deaths. A short time earlier, <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> and a Maldivian Foreign Ministry official, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleem </PERSON>, said at least 20 people were killed, including 13 civilians and seven <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> security men. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> said the mercenaries, estimated to number about 150, fled in two boats and one dingy. He said the four who fled in the dingy surrendered Friday on a neighboring island. One boat carried mercenaries and the hostages, and the whereabouts of the other boat was unknown, he said. Shops and businesses in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> were closed today after President <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> declared a day of mourning for those killed in the attempted coup. <PERSON> Suleem </PERSON> said there were about 18 hostages aboard the boat halted by the Indian navy and that the hostages included Transport Minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujithaba </PERSON> and his wife. No one could say how many mercenaries were on the boat. A senior <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> air force officer at the south Indian airport at <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION> said the hostages were hustled aboard the 5,000-ton boat when the gunmen fled through blasts of Indian machine-gun fire on Friday. In <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the biggest Tamil militant group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, denied involvement in the attempted coup. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> have been waging a five-year separatist war against <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Sinhalese-dominated government. In the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, Indian troops started a new house-to-house search operation today for arms and foreign gunmen who may have failed to escape, said a Male resident reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The residents were advised by state radio to stay indoors today. The <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, population 190,000, gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1965 and became a republic in 1968.

 The South was belted by thunderstorms today after a violent weather system in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> brought destructive winds, hail the size of golf balls and numerous tornadoes that killed at least one person. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, eight tornadoes were spawned Friday night by severe thunderstorms, mainly in the northern portions of the state.

The tornado left 12 people injured in or near the truck stop and a total of 17 people hurt in the county as a result of the violent weather, authorities said. One man was admitted to a hospital but other injuries reported were minor, officials said. `` I went inside the truck stop and lay down on the floor where everybody else was,'' said <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` All we could do was pray.'' In northeast <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, high winds forced workers to evacuate 30 of 52 residents of the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, but no injuries were reported. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, thunderstorm winds caused heavy damage to three homes in southeast <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where roofs were blown off and large trees and power lines were downed.

Heavy rains dumped 4.8 inches of water at <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on the Big Island. Throughout the islands, roads were closed and boaters ran aground in the high surf. Power and telephone service was knocked out in some areas. There were no reports of major damage or injuries.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> today said the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement leading to the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from the war-torn country was near ruin, and he called for a new international debate on it. The statement by <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> to Afghan legislators came one day after Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had stopped withdrawing its soldiers because of unrelenting pressure from rebels. <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent advanced weapons to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, an apparent reference to MiG-27 jets and SS-1 Scud missiles spotted there. The moves appeared designed to increase pressure on anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas who have stepped up their attacks since the Soviets began withdrawing May 15, and on their backers _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> today condemned the Soviet moves, saying they violate the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and raise doubts about <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s commitment to end the war. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> told a group of Afghan legislators that the supply of modern weaponry to the guerrillas by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` is a very serious blow to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, which practically torpedoes them.'' `` The time has come for a new international debate of all aspects of the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and around it, because foreign powers _ <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ are involved here,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> as saying in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which helped negotiate the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, could help straighten out the situation. <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still is committed to completing its troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. But he added that Soviet compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords also depended on whether the other signers obeyed it as well, indicating that the Soviets may be considering keeping soldiers in the country after the deadline. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> did not address that issue and did not say what kind of an international debate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet newspapers published this morning did not carry <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>'s announcement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was halting its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a statement from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, said the suspension and the indroduction of new Soviet weapons `` are incompatible with the understanding that the only military activity to be undertaken by Soviet forces would be in defense of their withdrawing troops.'' More than 13,000 Soviet soldiers have died in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the war has become increasingly unpopular in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls the war a `` bleeding wound,'' and Nobel Peace Prize-winner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> says it is `` one of the greatest tragedies of our times.'' But <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>'s statement showed deepening Soviet frustration with how forces of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s pro-Soviet government are faring against the insurgents since the Soviet withdrawal began. In September, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnaze </PERSON> said the Soviets had finished the first part of a pullout set to end Feb. 15, but had not begun the second phase, saying it depended on whether violations of the accords cease. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers have said half the Soviet troops withdrew by Aug. 15, so <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statement meant the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> retreat stopped since then. The withdrawal began May 15.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of protesters screaming for the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> on corruption charges battled riot police and demonstrated today in eight <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> cities. At least 11 officers were injured, including 10 when a police station in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> was firebombed, authorities said. Witnesses said dozens of protesters were injured but police provided no details. Tear gas was used to break up demonstrations in all eight cities. Fierce fighting broke out in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the capital, when riot police stopped 10,000 dissidents and students trying to march to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s house after an anti-Chun rally at a downtown park. `` Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!'' demonstrators shouted as they charged riot police with rocks, bricks and clubs. Police fired barrages of tear gas and chased protesters into sidestreets and alleys. The number of protesters swelled to more than 15,000 at one crowded shopping district, and clashes continued several hours after nightfall. Protesters burned effigies of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Some shouted slogans demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Others demanded the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, claiming his government is a front for military rule. Police martial arts squads charged protesters into sidestreets, beating and kicking, but the protesters regrouped and occupied several other boulevards. A police officer was injured seriously on the southern outskirts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when students brandishing firebombs and iron bars attacked an office of the governing political party. Police said 10 other officers were injured when a three-story police station was firebombed in another section of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Dissidents and radical students had called for nationwide rallies today to demand the arrest and punishment of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> for alleged corruption and violations of human rights during his seven-year tenure, which ended in February. Police reported firing tear gas to thwart anti-Chun rallies in seven other cities _ <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chunchon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> and Wonju. In <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, an opposition stronghold south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, fighting began late today when police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters trying to burn an effigy of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> after a street march, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency said. In <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, police said hundreds of students armed with firebombs and rocks attacked a government prosecutors' building, burned two police buses and damaged eight cars. Dozens of windows were smashed. At least one student was injured when he fell off a third-floor window to the ground, and eight students were arrested for seizing the prosecutors' building, police said. During the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> rally today, dissident leaders called for bigger rallies next week and vowed to attack <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s house. As part of their anti-government campaign, radical students have attacked government buildings and offices of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since riot police thwarted a march Thursday by thousands of students hurling rocks and firebombs. Opposition parties today turned down a governing party proposal that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> apologize or respond to allegations of corruption during his tenure. The three major opposition groups are moving to subpoena the ex-president to testify in a parliamentary investigation, but the governing party objects to the move. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was recently sentenced to seven years' in prison for taking bribes and misusing millions of dollars in government money while he headed a rural development program. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who took power with military backing in 1980, also is being investigated for his alleged role in putting down a 1980 civil uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. By official count, about 200 people died in the military suppression of the nine-day uprising.

<TEXT>
 The campaigns of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ushered in the final few days of the contest with a flurry of new ads, including the debut of two appeals from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attack ad on drugs. The candidates were spending millions on television in key states such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, in addition to network slots during the final four-day push. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also arranged a $ 1.3 million advertising drive on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS from Friday through Monday, with five primetime slots on each network and another during Saturday afternoon sports events on each network. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to repeat a five-minute, populist-flavored message originally broadcast Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. It will be rebroadcast Saturday at 10:55 p.m. EST on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Cost of the time: about $ 375,000 for both slots. In addition, each candidate has paid nearly $ 1 million to buy a half-hour on all three networks on Election Eve. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will make his final appeal at 8 p.m. EST followed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at 8:30 p.m. And they were taking advantage of another round of appearances on news and interview programs. Both candidates were interviewed Friday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s World News Tonight and by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> for an hour-long syndicated show airing Saturday and Sunday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was scheduled to be on an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> campaign special Sunday night. One of the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ads shows the vice president talking into the camera asking voters to look at his and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' records `` because this campaign is about very real differences, very real hopes, very real dreams.'' `` My vision is a growing and strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with low taxes, a strong national defense and tough laws to fight crime,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says. `` My mission is to keep building a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that remains second to none.'' The other spot is set to the song `` God Bless the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' sung by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>. The lyrics include lines such as, `` I'm proud to be an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> where at least I know I'm free ...'cause there ai n't no doubt I love this land _ God bless the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' The lyrics are intercut with narration to the effect that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the only candidate qualified to be `` the next leader of the free world.'' The ad is set to images of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the campaign trail, with children, with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ad, a variation on several he has released on the drug theme, attacks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to make his running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the nation's drug czar. `` First he said he'd put <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge,'' a narrator says. `` Now he refuses to cut off aid to countries that allow drug traffic. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> thinks he's dead wrong.'' The scene shifts to a large rally, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is saying, `` If you're against us, do n't expect a dime of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign aid. ... I'll work with other countries but I'll be damned if I let those countries send their poison into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Democrats began running a radio ad to counter Republican-sponsored, Spanish-language radio spots carrying two warnings that `` voting officials will be watching closely'' on Election Day to make sure non-citizens do not vote and voters do not accept money.

 The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today met for the third time since U.N.-mediated peace talks resumed six days ago. Neither minister made any comment before entering the session, mediated by by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The ministers last met Wednesday. Since then, technical experts from each side have held one meeting, and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met separately once with the two foreign ministers, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced he would leave <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> tonight for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and return Sunday to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> appointed a premier today and asked him to form a new government to begin solving the country's economic crisis, the Algerian news agency reported. The appointment of Health Minister <PERSON> Kasdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> to the post came two days after Algerians overwhelmingly approved changes to the constitution that grant the premier new powers. Another provision of the reform, approved by 92 percent of the voters in Thursday's referendum, is aimed at separating the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the only legal political party, from the day-to-day running of the government. Algerians took to the streets last month to protest a declining standard of living, food shortages and a lack of jobs. By official count, the riots left 176 people dead when troops fired into crowds that failed to disperse. The rioting ended when <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> promised political and economic reforms, begining with the referendum and the naming of a new government. <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON>, 50, replaces <PERSON> Brahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahimi </PERSON>, whom the official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Algerie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, did not mention in its dispatch. The new premier has served under <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> as minister of agriculture, and for the past 10 months as minister of health. <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> oversaw the conversion of many enormous state farms into small, private collectives _ a change regarded by Western economists as one of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s more successful attempts at making the economy more productive and efficient. `` He is known as a can-do guy,'' said one Western diplomat. It was not immediately known when the rest of the new government would be named. It faces the immense challenge of pulling <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> out of a crisis brought on by the plummeting price of oil, which represents 97 percent of the country's export earnings.

 A bus driver whose vehicle was commandeered by a passenger who accepted his challenge to `` drive this better than I can'' has been fired, transit officials said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 36, was dismissed Friday, a day after his case was heard by an <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, said transit district spokeswoman <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. The driver was dismissed for berating a passenger and leaving a bus unattended, Ms. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> could not immediately be reached for comment. His phone number was not listed in the <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> directory. He had not driven for the district since Oct. 19 when witnesses said he stepped off his bus after challenging passenger <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> to do a better job than him. <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON>, a 52-year-old Buena Park engineer, said the dare came after he complained about the driver's berating a passenger for not giving him the proper bus fare. He also said he chided <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> about his driving, complaining that his sudden starts and stops were throwing people back and forth in their seats. At that point, <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told him, `` I suppose you think you can drive this better than I can.'' When <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> said he could, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> got off the bus and stood on a street corner with his arms folded. He was left there when <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> put the bus in gear and pulled away. He carried the vehicle's 31 passengers more than mile, stopping to let people off and on, before police pulled him over. Other passengers said later that <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> made change, gave them transfer tickets and was courteous. <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> was cited for joy riding and operating the vehicle without a bus-driver's license. He is scheduled to appear in Municipal Court on Monday and faces a maximum of $ 400 in fines and three months in jail.

Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports free trade whereas Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems to be leaning toward protectionism. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defends the free market whereas Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supports government intervention. And yet the distinctions between these two men are not at all so clear. `` Either of them will be likely to emphasize Japan-U.S. relations as a central element in their foreign policy. ... `` On trade, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to uphold the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's devotion to free trade in principle, if not always in practice. ... Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been transformed in a few short months from the free trader among the Democratic contenders to a protectionist in comparison with Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. ... `` On the economy, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adheres to the laissez-faire principles of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, proposes an ` economic development strategy' which at times follows closely on the model of Japanese industrial policy. ... `` Paradoxically, perhaps, a revival of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness would serve <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s best interests in the long run. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial erosion continues, no <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leader will be able to fight off the forces of protectionism. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy resurges, however, this could provide an important engine for growth in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins, as the polls indicate he will, we can only hope that he will be magnanimous enough in victory to learn some lessons from his opponent as from his predecessor.''

<TEXT>
 Although they are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, Puerto Ricans can not vote for president on Election Day. But the next occupant of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could help determine whether this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island remains a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth or becomes the 51st state. The Republican candidate, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has aligned himself with the pro-statehood party. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is for commonwealth. The Spanish-speaking island of 3.3 million people 1,000 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has been a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth for 36 years. Although it has nearly as much control over its affairs as the 50 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is not a state. It is not a colony either, although some say it comes close. A small but vocal minority favors independence. All three main parties _ Popular Democratic, <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> _ want the relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to change. They are putting up candidates for governor, legislators, mayors and one non-voting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Congressional delegate. Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, the pro-commonwealth candidate, is seeking a third term and in polls has maintained a comfortable lead over his chief rival, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Baltasar </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrada </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, who favors statehood. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> wants strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties but more autonomy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is his man. `` I am a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supports me,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The statehood party is with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans deny <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> any change.'' For example, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> was not pleased when Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> turned down a request in 1986 to seek a treaty with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to give Japanese firms tax breaks in the island. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, first elected in 1972 and re-elected in 1984, wants more leeway in economic, foreign trade and immigration issues. His Popular <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> runs under the slogan `` bread, land and liberty,'' implying <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> has its cake and eats it too. `` We have the best of both worlds,'' said law professor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. `` Puerto Rican people do n't want the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to get out, but they also do n't want them to rule the country.'' As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, Puerto Ricans are eligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military service and welfare benefits. But they do n't pay federal taxes and ca n't vote for president. The island received $ 6.5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid this year, and with tax exemptions for American companies, it has <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'s strongest economy. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>'s campaign focuses on economic gains. He cites a drop of 14 percent in the unemployment rate, which was more than 23 percent in 1985 when he took office. Economic growth has been 5 percent over the same period, according to government figures. <PERSON> Corrada </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> says the governor should thank the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the strong economy. `` If the economy has grown, the credit belongs to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, not to you,'' he said in a television debate. His New <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose slogan is `` statehood, security, progress,'' says a statehood advantage would be to vote in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elections. `` It's a sovereignty issue,'' said the party's Sen. <PERSON> Oreste </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>. `` We are governed by people we ca n't vote for. And we want to participate in that process.'' The Independence Party's gubernatorial candidate, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated law professor, says <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is grossly overdependent on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Chickens! We import chickens!'' he said. `` We're not capable of raising our own?'' <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>' party has n't won more than 6 percent of the vote in 20 years. All candidates have promised a referendum on the status issue after the election. But <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said he wants beforehand a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge to honor the outcome. In the last referendum in 1967, 60 percent wanted commonwealth to continue, 39 percent preferred statehood and 1 percent supported independence. Whatever this election's outcome, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s status is not likely to change soon. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to approve any proposal. Still, if <PERSON> Corrada </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s statehood party wins and so does <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the chances of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> becoming a state would be enhanced. And what if the polls are right and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> both win? `` I can work with the Republican administration,'' the governor said. `` It's just in relation to our status that the Republicans do n't cooperate.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election failed to produce a clear statement on how Israelis want to approach peace with the Arabs and on the future of the occupied territories. The balloting for Parliament seats was seen as a referendum on the peace issue after 11 months of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But results indicate Israelis remain deeply divided on the issues. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Avineri </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION>, said about 30 percent of Israelis want to annex occupied land, while another third prefer territorial compromise. `` The people in the middle found an easy option, voting for ethnic or religious parties, but not coming down on the major issue of peace,'' said <PERSON> Avineri </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc will likely lead the next government, probably by forming a coalition with small right-wing parties and Orthodox religious factions. But the electorate did not give <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> a mandate for introducing hard-line policies. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is committed to expanding Jewish settlements, but he was quick to assure voters he would not go along with right-wing calls to annex the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> or expel its 1.5 million Palestinian residents. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, failed to convince voters there was a reliable <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> partner for peace. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had argued that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should accept <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> demands for an international conference because it was the only way to get <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> into the process as a stand-in for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> But <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> appeared to vacillate, reinforcing a widely held belief in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that he lacked the courage of the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to make peace. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced July 31 that he was cutting ties with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the occupied lands. Then in the final days of the campaign he signaled he had changed his mind. He met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and gave a belated endorsement to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' plan as a `` step forward.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s supporters let it be know the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was planning a declaration of Palestinian independence, reinforcing right-wing alarms that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' approach would lead to creation of a Palestinian state. `` What the organization -LRB- PLO -RRB- had somehow neglected to do was to offer any convincing proof that it was itself a legitimate partner to peace talks,'' said the pro-Labor <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The final blow for the credibility of Arab intentions came in firebombings in the final days of the campaign. An Israeli woman and her three children burned to death last Sunday and a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporter was seriously hurt as voting was under way Tuesday. `` Israelis go to the right when fears for security go up,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Leonard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>. He said Israelis feared that in an international conference, other countries would gang up and demand concessions that would threaten the nation's security. Moderate Palestinians, however, were equally disappointed in the Israelis for failing to give a mandate to negotiations. `` In the past, Israelis complained that they lacked a partner for peace. Now, it's the Arabs who can not find a partner in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>. Some Palestinians, like <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, predicted Palestinians would react by stepping up violence in the occupied lands. More than 300 Arabs, and 10 Israelis, have died since the uprising began Dec. 8. `` It's obvious Israelis do n't want peace, but we will hit back,'' said <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>. In meetings with small right-wing parties, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refused extremist demands for annexation of the occupied land and the expulsion of Arabs. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> clarified that the idea of transfer -LRB- of Arabs -RRB- will not be included in the guidelines of the next government. The concept is rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> pledged to support new Jewish settlements in occupied areas, but <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> noted the effort would be constrained by the amount of money available.

<HEAD>Government Tightens Measures Against Child Labor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Saturday it will fine and close the growing number of factories that illegally employ children, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. Factories that hire workers under the age of 16 face fines of $ 810 to $ 1,350 per child and will have their licenses revoked if they continue to defy the labor laws, the report said. It quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying child labor is particularly prevalent in economically booming areas. In some rural factories, 20 percent of the workers are children, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In August, coastal <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province banned the recruitment of child laborers after news reports said more than 1,000 children were working in factories in the city of <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>. Many of the factories using cheap child labor are foreign joint ventures or foreign-funded firms, the reports said. The government said all private enterprises and individuals wishing to recruit workers have to sign contracts with the employees that must be approved by labor authorities. Schools have been asked to tighten controls over dropouts, and parents who force children under 16 to work will be liable to fines and punishment, the report said.

 `` Well, what do we do now?'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the morning after they were elected eight years ago. Either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will face that question come Wednesday, and the answer is not as evident now as it was in 1980. The long campaign between Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been filled with political symbols, such as the flag and the Pledge of Allegiance, but short on specifics about what either candidate actually would do in the White House. There have been no overriding issues, such as a faltering economy or a threat to peace that have compelled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to come forward with bold ideas. For example, neither candidate has been willing to offer a concrete program for shrinking the huge budget deficit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election was viewed as a mandate for a change in course from the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. He pledged to cut taxes, build up the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and cut down the government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, ahead in the polls a few days before the election, promises to stay the course set by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` When you have to change horses in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>, does n't it make sense to switch to the one who's going the same way?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. On the other hand, if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> managed an upset, there would be a major upheaval in policy and personnel. `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come,'' he promises. But again, few specifics. With the now familiar invitation to `` read my lips,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will not raise taxes and, indeed, will try to cut capital gains taxes. He says he will oppose new spending by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and personally negotiate with lawmakers for a `` flexible freeze'' on the budget. He promises to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s military strong, pressing ahead with research and eventual development of the Star Wars missile defense shield, while at the same time seeking progress with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And he says he will clean up the environment and strive to improve education. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also promises more money for child care, including a toddler tax credit of up to $ 1,000 per child under age 4 for poor families. He has proposed no less than five summits, including an early meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to `` size each other up correctly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to convene a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit `` as one of my first acts as president.'' He says there will be a global conference on the environment at the White House within the first year in office and a summit of Western hemisphere nations to chart strategy for a war against drugs. Moreover, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will `` meet with all the governors to discuss the most urgent problems facing our nation's schools.'' In addition, each year the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meets with the leaders of the six other richest nations in the world at an economic summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will make agriculture the top item on the agenda. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises a crackdown on tax cheats who he says beat the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> out of $ 110 billion a year. He says he'll hire more tax inspectors _ which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seized on as a promise that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would put an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent in every kitchen. On taxes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says no responsible candidate can rule out the possibility of new taxes, but that he'd ask an increase only as a last resort. To fight drugs, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would double the number of agents at the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> within five years and hire 800 more federal prosecutors to handle drug cases. He says he will wipe out the trade deficit in four years and put the country on the course toward a balanced budget. On defense, he calls Star Wars a fantasy but still would put $ 1 billion in the budget for it, about 25 percent of what it gets now. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises to find a `` sensible, affordable'' way to modernize the land-based nuclear missile arsenal but opposes the MX missile. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also would scrap two planned aircraft carrier task forces, but said he would bolster military readiness with a `` conventional defense initiative.'' He says he would lay out the prospect of better economic ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a way of achieving concessions on arms control, human rights and other superpower problems. Under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> would become a Cabinet agency. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would seek legislation to require employers to provide health insurance to all employees. He also proposes to raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to at least $ 4.55. While a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration would bring a wholesale turnover in government managers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be expected to keep at least several of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet officers, including possibly <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman, is a likely bet for secretary of state in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.

<HEAD>Governor Negotiates Deals For Wright Items Going To Museum</HEAD>

 Rare furniture designed by architect <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will return to its original home in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> following efforts by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and more than $ 800,000 in donations. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Friday he has negotiated deals for the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> museum to buy the furniture, a $ 704,000 double pedestal table lamp, a $ 20,000 drafting table and four dining room chairs costing $ 120,000. `` There are only a few major pieces from the <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> home that are still privately owned, so the opportunities to purchase them, either at auction or by private sale agreements, are extremely rare,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Experts describe the Dana-Thomas house, built by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for $ 60,000 around 1903, as one of the finest examples of the architect's <ORGANIZATION> Prairie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> houses open to the public. The house, commissioned by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> and now maintained by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the most completely furnished of all <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s buildings. The lamp was purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> through a direct sale arranged without fee by <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said, noting that it is scheduled to arrive upon final payment next June. `` Considering the near-hysteria surrounding the acquisition of authentic <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> pieces and the rapidly escalating prices being offered by collectors, we were pleased that <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s agreed to the private sale of this rare lamp,'' he said. The chairs were bought from a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> family and were returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in September. The drafting table will be bought from a private owner through <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will continue campaigning hard against the Democrats, who he said `` thought they were going to kick my brains out and get away with it'' at their <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention. `` They can dish it out but they ca n't take it,'' he told campaign workers at Republican headquarters, before setting out on a door-to-door get-out-the-vote tour. In answer to reports that he was tiring and cutting back, the vice president promised that the day would be `` one of the darndest days we've ever seen so that everybody will be exhausted.'' His campaign schedule, however, was being altered. A rally in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> tonight was rescheduled for Sunday morning, replacing a <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, event. A CBS poll showed his race with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tightening but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I do n't believe those polls.'' And finally, he told reporters, `` Do I feel I've got a good shot at winning? Absolutely.'' In <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, Friday night, with his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and daughter <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` You're looking at three tired people here.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign strategists were changing his schedule several times a day as they figured which battleground states to send him into. `` They're making strategic decisions based on a whole lot of last-minute data including polling, local pressures and the ability to checkmate our opponent,'' press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. The idea is to use the last three days of the campaign `` trying to make inroads, not let him get any momentum'' and make it impossible for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win the states his campaign says it is counting on to garner the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule changes were coming on such short notice that the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was doing only a fraction of the advance work that normally begins several days before a visit to any city. Today's swing included <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for the second time in a week, as a poll published in the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had pulled within four percentage points of him statewide. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to be back again in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on Sunday night, after a day trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Earlier Friday, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the conduct of a presidential campaign some have labeled one of the most negative in recent history. `` The idea that this campaign is so different from others _ I do n't believe it. I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people believe it, all this stuff about being turned off. You can always go out and find people to say that,'' he said. He also expressed dismay that a consulting firm headed by his longtime associate <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -LRB- no relation -RRB- had sought business with the Haitian government by touting the firm's ties to the vice president. `` I denounce it, I do n't like it, I think it's wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the intiative in his name was done without his approval by his partner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Govan </PERSON>. Asked how <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, deputy fundraising director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s primary election campaign and now a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> consultant, could have allowed it to happen, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Ask him how he could allow it to happen. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the lobbying episode does not indicate what would happen in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, because, `` I've been in public life for 20 years, and no one has ever made any allegations about impropriety on my part because they know how strongly I feel about ethics in government.'' The vice president, interviewed on his plane between events in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, dismissed suggestions that his campaign was easing off in anticipation of victory, as his weekend schedule filled up to bolster his argument. `` We ca n't do any more, we just ca n't,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Also in the AP interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested working toward a free trade pact with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> similar to the one recently negotiated with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said he opposes such an arrangement at this time with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The morning of Nov. 10, 1938, <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> saw synagogues aflame. By afternoon, the 15-year-old boy and his father had been arrested and beaten by <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Within months, <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON>, his father and thousands of other Austrian Jews were deported to the <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> concentration camp. In April 1945, <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> was freed from the dreaded <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, the third death camp in his ghoulish odyssey through Nazi terror. He weighed just 77 pounds. Today, <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>, 65, a slender, quick-witted man, sits in his apartment in a nondescript tenement bloc in suburban <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and recalls how his terror began on the night now called Kristallnacht: `` In the morning of Nov. 10, we saw two synagogues burning in the Leopoldstadt -LRB- then a largely Jewish district of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> -RRB-. Then we waited for the knock on the door. `` In the afternoon I was arrested. So was my father. After I was maltreated at police headquarters ... I was allowed to go home because I was only 15.'' A day later, police released <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>'s father, who two decades earlier had been seriously wounded and decorated as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian army. Those World War I decorations did not impress the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> and many of his family were deported the next year. `` Half of my family were gassed, including one sister and my mother,'' <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> said. Another sister and a younger brother escaped and ended up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where they still live. `` They burned synagogues and other places of worship. It was terrible ... howling people were standing by,'' screaming anti-Semitic slogans, <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> recalled. `` The firefighters arrived all right, but they were under orders not to extinguish the synagogue fires. They protected nearby buildings from catching fire until the Jewish temples were burned out.'' Speaking the broad German dialect of the Viennese working class, <PERSON> Kleimann </PERSON> said the officially endorsed pogrom was a welcome opportunity for many Viennese to vent their anti-Semitism. They looted and stole from Jews, humiliated and mistreated them. `` The terrible thing was that our neighbors, my friends, my father's friends, were among those beating us, vilifying us, spitting at us. Young people who had been my playmates were suddenly <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON> who turned against us,'' he said. Unlike in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, then home to some 200,000 Jews, did not wait for Kristallnacht to start burning and ransacking. Existing Nazi documents and data in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s fire department show numerous Jewish temples were devastated in October that year. On Oct. 16, firemen were called to extinguish a fire involving the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, records show. According to a report on Kristallnacht by Austrian Jews, some 7,800 people were arrested and an unknown number killed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> alone. The detained were taken to so-called collection camps and brutally treated, while 4,083 <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> shops were plundered, the report found. Some 680 people, many of them Jews, committed suicide on Nov. 10 and subsequent days, said the report by intellectuals, camp survivors and members of the Jewish community Many synagogues, some of them local landmarks, were completely gutted, with mobs throwing hand grenades to set them ablaze. It was only this year that <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> city authorities unveiled plaques to mark remind citizens of the sites where synagogues stood 50 years ago. But <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> and the few who survived the Holocaust never forgot. It took only three weeks after the Nazi Anschluss of March 1938 for <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> to lose his apprenticeship in house decorating, his father's trade. Like tens of thousands of others, he was jobless because he was a Jew. His family was too poor to emigrate and survived on meals from a Jewish relief service. At first, Aryan friends helped <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>'s father survive, slipping him illegal work. Soon, the help turned to scorn and insults. <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>'s two sisters were often picked up by Nazi patrols, mostly former friends, for `` rubbing,'' the practice of forcing Jews to rub walls, pavements and cobblestone roads to remove painted slogans predating the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> annexation. `` I remember that one day I asked a former friend why he was picking up my sister,'' <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> said. `` He said he was ordered to get hold of the girl by a Nazi cell foreman, whom she had once refused to kiss in the doorway.''

 As in hundreds of other towns across <LOCATION> Nazi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, terror struck Jews in this picturesque village on the infamous `` Kristallnacht.'' A half-century later, students there are still confronting the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. Last month, the 23 students in <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>'s history class heard a former Jewish resident describe the tensions that led up to the brutality of Nov. 9-10, 1938. Later, in a roundtable discussion with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, students in this town of 11,400 people north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> discussed the night when thugs ransacked the homes of the 10 to 15 Jews who lived in <LOCATION> Usingen </LOCATION>, then a rural village. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenzel </PERSON>, 18, said Kristallnacht, named for the sparkling shards of broken glass that littered streets and sidewalks after the vandalism, was a `` channeling of aggression'' against the Jews. Asked about constant reminders of Kristallnacht and other Nazi atrocities, he said: `` There is the danger the Nazi era could be disposed of, or settled in a way. But this history should always be alive.'' <PERSON> Stenzel </PERSON> also sees sharp differences among generations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has paid more than 80 billion marks -LRB- $ 44 billion at 1988 values -RRB- to Nazi victims and their families. `` The older generation has kept the prejudiced view of Jews,'' he said, adding that this was n't true with younger generations. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, 20, said: `` I can well imagine there were feelings of jealousy because the Jews were merchants and in general were better off financially. But I just do n't think it could happen again. People are more broad-minded now. They would n't do it again.'' None of the six students taking part in the Oct. 13 discussion at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian-Wirth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was Jewish. All are working toward the Abitur, the examination which grants a prestigious diploma roughly equivalent to a junior college degree in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, like her classmates, also said the older generation views the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era far differently from today's younger Germans. `` My grandmother tells me that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> brought order to the country,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, adding that her grandmother dwells on the chaos that plagued the <LOCATION> Weimar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> after World War I. `` She says after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> came to power, it was n't that way anymore. You could walk down the street without being afraid.'' <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> <PERSON> Pachl </PERSON>, 18, agreed the `` biggest danger'' was that the legacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> could eventually be put aside. But he, too, noted that some Germans think it is time to stop dwelling on the past. `` Many people feel under attack, including from people outside the country,'' <PERSON> Pachl </PERSON> said of Holocaust reminders. He said he remembered watching television documentaries as a child. `` I had the feeling it was aimed at me as a German,'' <PERSON> Pachl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kerstin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumke </PERSON>, 18, said of Kristallnacht violence, `` I can imagine that some people were swept up by what was happening, even if they did n't have any hatred for the Jews beforehand.'' Like the others interviewed, Ms. <PERSON> Dumke </PERSON> has traveled to other countries, and she said the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past comes up there, too. `` There's less interest in what is happening today than what happened in the past. It's something that you drag around with you all the time,'' she said. The students had heard from <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilienstein </PERSON>, 67, an <LOCATION> Usingen </LOCATION> native who emigrated a year before that terrible night. A retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> educator, <PERSON> Lilienstein </PERSON> studied at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian-Wirth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> more than 50 years ago, according to the 42-year-old <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>. `` For some of them, it was the first time they'd ever seen a Jew, knowing it was a Jew. Certainly, it was the first time many had really talked to a Jew,'' <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said. In a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lilienstein </PERSON> said of his meeting: `` I was amazed both at their lack of knowledge about what really happened, but also at their interest in questioning me.''

 <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Maulfair </PERSON> claimed he got bladder cancer because he handled plutonium during the 26 years he worked at the Rocky Flats nuclear plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maulfair </PERSON>, who retired about two years before the cancer was diagnosed, filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contractors who operate the nuclear weapons facility. As part of a 1986 out-of-court settlement, <PERSON> Maulfair </PERSON> agreed not to discuss any payments he might receive or make any further charges that the cancer, which was removed surgically and has not recurred, was caused by exposure to the plutonium processed at Rocky Flats. `` If I disclose anything about the agreement, they can come back and sue me,'' said the 71-year-old <PERSON> Maulfair </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. `` They have people like me pretty well shut-up.'' <PERSON> Maulfair </PERSON>'s case is symptomatic of the problems faced by the 90,000 workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons production complex in documenting any relation between exposure to radiation and cancer or other diseases. Four of the 17 major facilities operated by the department in 13 states have been wholly or partially closed down for safety reasons, bringing nuclear weapons production to a virtual halt. And Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has informed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it could cost as much as $ 110 billion to clean up radioactive contamination at the sites and make them safe. However, present and past workers in the nuclear weapons complex say they still face a wall of secrecy around the effects of radiation on their health. Safety concerns have prompted unions and individuals to file dozens of lawsuits across the country. Additionally, some unions and other critics are demanding that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> provide independent researchers or another federal agency with data it has collected on 600,000 people who worked in the nuclear weapons production complex, starting with the top secret <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project in 1942. The research is being conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of 49 colleges, unversities and other institutions analyzing the data under contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Critics, and they are legion, have accused the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of suppressing and distorting data and delaying the research, and failing to inform workers at nuclear weapons plants of the practical implications of scientific findings. Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, director of the federal government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> from 1978 to 1981, said `` there is a potentially great risk'' to workers in the nuclear weapons complex `` The real issue is that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has chosen not to look too closely at the problem,'' said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>. The criticism had prompted senior officials in the department to review their health policies, said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, assistant energy secretary for public affairs. `` There are two issues we are looking at. One is the narrow issue of access to the data, for people who claim they have attempted to see it and have been denied,'' said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. That issue might be resolved within the month, he said. The department also is reviewing `` the wider issue of what we are doing with epidemilogical studies,'' and that officials might decide that major changes were needed in the way scientific analysis is conducted and how the results are presented to workers. The department has spent $ 42 million since 1964 analyzing the health and death records of 300,000 of the 600,000 workers who have worked in the federal nuclear weapons complex. That research has been turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> group, and its published findings are ambiguous. An Oak Ridge research team headed by <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cragle </PERSON>, under contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, found in a study released last month that a `` statistically significant'' number of a sample of 1,274 male workers at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> died from leukemia, a cancer of the blood system. However, the study also said the incidence of leukemia was `` unexplained,'' meaning that researchers were unable to establish a direct link between cancer and possible exposure to radiation at the plant, which produces plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. And it found `` fewer than the expected number of deaths'' from other types of cancer and diseases sometimes associated with exposure to radiation. The three working reactors at the plant, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, have been closed down for safety reasons and the first will not be restarted until next month at the earliest, according to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` Workers at the plant could have been exposed to external radiation from nuclear fuel processing activities and internal radiation from inhalation or ingestion of tritium, uranium, fission products, iodine, activation products, or other radionuclides including americium, plutonium, and neptunium,'' the Oak Ridge group said in a statement. It said that `` while examining individual cases, the researchers also found that a statistically significant, but yet unexplained, increase in the number of deaths from all types of leukemia combined among hourly employees hired before 1955 who were employed at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> -RRB- between five and seven years.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, said that the results obtained by the Oak Ridge group indicate `` the work needs to continue.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, a professor of public health at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> state health commissioner, said the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> results were skewed because they failed to take into account the `` healthy worker effect.'' The disease rates among <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> workers, he said, were compared with those of the general population, which includes elderly and hospitalized people, rather than the working population, which is healthier overall. `` If they come back with an answer that says that leukemia is elevated, then my conclusion is that the rates are much higher than normal,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cragle </PERSON>, the Oak Ridge researcher, said `` a lot of the criticism kind of goes overboard.'' The healthy worker effect was not relevant, because if you keep track of the popluation over a period of 20 years, the worker population begins to resemble the overall population,'' she said. And she said the research was going as quickly as possible, under the current budget. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortlieb </PERSON>, director of the health and safety department of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not told nuclear complex employees about the results of the Oak Ridge survey. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not notified workers of their studies,'' said <PERSON> Ortlieb </PERSON>. `` It seems that their primary interest is to publish their findings in scientific journals. Workers do not read scientific journals. There is not a system of informing workers.'' <PERSON> Cragle </PERSON> said that she and other researchers met regularly with workers at the Feed Materials Production Center, in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and had prepared a video for the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>. Moreover, she said, the results were published in layman's terms in the plant newspaper at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> group, the <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987 to gain access to the disputed data, with the intention of turning the information over to a noted British epidemiologist, Dr. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, said fund executive seretary <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anson </PERSON>, the senior department spokesman, said a decision would be made on the request `` in a couple of weeks,'' but declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>It Was a Strange Election a Hundred Years Ago</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The election of 100 years ago Sunday was one of strangest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history: the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON>, the incumbent president, won a narrow popular victory against challenger <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> had 5,540,309 votes and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> 5,439,853. But <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> took <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> by narrow margins for an electoral vote total of 233 to the president's 168. That has not happened since, but <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> are among the pivotal states this time, too. Both <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> and his wife took the defeat as a temporary setback. On leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> told the staff: `` I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again ... four years from today.'' They did come back, too. In 1892, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> defeated <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, winning both the popular and electoral vote to become the only president who ever served two terms that were not consecutive. Unknown practitioners of dirty tricks started a rumor in the 1888 campaign that <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> abused his young wife, whom he married in 1886. There apparently were no grounds for the rumor, which seemed to have done him little harm _ any more than the story that he was supporting an illegitimate child. That one was true and he admitted it at once. The story gave rise to a celebrated street song: `` Maw, Maw, where's my paw? `` Gone to the White House `` Haw, haw, haw.'' There was some doubt whether the child was his. He had known the mother, a widow named <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, during his early political career in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She named her son <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Folsom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> In the 1884 election, which <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> won over <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>, a supporter suggested: `` We are told that Mr. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> has been delinquent in office but blameless in private life, while Mr. <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> has been a model of official integrity but culpable in his personal relations. We should therefore elect Mr. <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> to the public office which he is so well qualified to fill and remand Mr. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> to the private station he is admirably fitted to adorn.'' The voters took the advice. Indifference to scandal was not the only thing that made campaigns different then. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> ran into trouble in 1888 because he had a budget surplus _ the federal government's revenue amounted to $ 371 million, $ 103 million more than its spending. Much of the embarrassing surplus came from tariffs on imported goods. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, a Democrat, wanted lower tariffs. That was partly because he wanted to import more cheap manufactured goods for the benefit of farmers who were important supporters of his party. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a Republican, got support from industrialists who wanted a high tariff to protect their products from foreign competition. After the 1888 election, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and the 51st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> got rid of the surplus. It was called the `` billion-dollar <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' because it was the first that ever spent that much. There was some help from <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. A Civil War hero himself, he appointed as commissioner of pensions `` Corporal'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, whose policy was to help `` every old comrade that needs it.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, buoyed by surveys indicating a tightening presidential race, declared today that `` the Republicans began celebrating a little early.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shrugged off the numbers and said, `` You know me, I do n't believe those polls.'' The candidates launched their final weekend of campaigning amid a blizzard of pre-election polls. Aides hastily re-constructed campaign schedules on the basis of those numbers and thus <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending the day in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focused on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a warehouse rally, `` I think the Republican Party began celebrating a little early, do n't you? They were taking you for granted.'' He also continued his populist appeal. `` We're on the side of people who live off a family budget, not a family fortune,'' he said. `` He's on their side. We're on your side.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't trust new polls indicating a closer race. `` You know me, I do n't believe those polls,'' he said. The Republican nominee told workers in his <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, headquarters that the Democrats set the negative tone of the campaign. `` Let me tell you ... what I've had to do because I think everybody here and everybody across the country knows that when the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign came on and that convention, they thought they were going to kick my brains out and get away with it. They can dish it out but they ca n't take it,'' he said. Both presidential candidates were showing no signs of letting up in the final three days of the campaign, as a poll released Friday showed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead shrank from 12 points to seven points in three days. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leading 51 percent to 44 percent among probable voters, but also indicated as much as 24 percent of voters may not have made a final decision. Another half dozen national polls were expected over the weekend as well as a flurry of state-by-state surveys. A poll of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> voters, for example, showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 48 percent to 45 percent, the first time the Republican has led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in that state. The Northstar Poll was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, WCCO-TV and WCCO-Radio. The four-point margin of error made the lead statistically meaningless. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for a rally aimed at nabbing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47 electoral votes. `` We win this one, we win it all,'' he said upon arrival Friday at <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has entered the final stages of his campaign by invoking traditional Democratic themes and names, further aligned himself with that past by marching in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Democratic torchlight parade. Although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been growing increasingly hoarse in this final week, his voice was working at nearly full throttle when he told a post-parade rally: `` In 1960, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> went into that last weekend down eight points in the polls,'' he told an audience that went to its feet more than a dozen times. `` We're doing better than that. You can feel that surge and you can feel that excitement.'' He was joined by his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, who was recovering from a viral infection, and four former rivals: Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, former Gov <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interspersed his campaign appearances with individual media interviews He, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> pounced on a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> headline, `` What a Mess!,'' referring to the state's finances. `` He got into it by overspending,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, `` How did he get out of it or try to? By raising taxes a total of $ 180 million this year alone. ... Now he's borrowing like mad, writing checks that he does n't even have enough money in the bank to cover. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Voorhees </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ranked 30th among states in annual job growth in 1986 and 1987, `` and with yesterday's papers reporting a state bank account overdrawn by as much as $ 190 million for a month, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day.'' `` He likes to talk about a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, `` But the only miracle involving <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> will be the one he needs to get out of the mess he created for his state.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, interviewed back-to-back Friday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight,'' were asked about the nastiness that has pervaded their race <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his own campaign has been `` hardhitting but it's been fair and it's been accurate.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was attacking him to `` divert attention from a failed record on the war against drugs, from the kind of sleaze and corruption we've seen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said: `` The idea that this campaign is so different from others _ I do n't believe it I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people believe it, all this stuff about being turned off.'' Both campaigns were pouring a fortune into network advertising campaigns over the weekend _ $ 1.3 million was the announced figure for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and $ 375,000 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ not to mention additional thousands on both sides for commercials targeted to battleground states. In addition to their weekend advertising plans, each candidate has paid nearly $ 1 million to buy a half-hour slot on all three networks on Election Eve. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will make his final appeal at 8 p.m. EST followed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at 8:30 p.m.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead in the polls is causing some political operatives to worry that the networks might call a landslide win early on election evening and discourage potential voters in some close <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said pleas to the TV networks to withhold conclusions about the election's outcome until after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> polls are closed have yielded little `` We have asked them not to call the race based on exit polling,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. But he acknowledged that `` the competitive drive is going to escape any kind of restraint.'' Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have pledged not to make any statement of victory or defeat until all polls on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> have closed. The pledges from the two camps are `` a significant step to increase voter participation in Tuesday's election,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., who solicited the statements from the two campaigns Television executives have said they will not call the election in any state until its polls are closed. But they also have made it clear that if a candidate exceeds the 270 electoral vote margin needed for election, they will not sit on the news. Polls in Eastern states begin to close as early as 6 p.m., while the closing time in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is 11 p.m. Eastern time. For <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, poll closing is midnight Eastern time. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said the effect of announcing a presidential election victory before all polls are closed might be to discourage <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> voters from casting their ballots, even though local races might be very tight. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the race between Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> and Republican former Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> is a dead heat, as is the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> contest between incumbent Sen. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, a Republican, and Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. Those races, as well as potentially close <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> contests in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> could be affected by an early outcome in the presidential race, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` It was disastrous in 1980,'' when Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lost after the networks called the election for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shortly after 8 p.m. and President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> conceded soon afterward, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. Then, there were reports that voters lined up at polling places went home without voting after hearing the outcome of the presidential race reported, based on network exit polling. This time, it is unclear what effect an early call might have on the closest <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said, for example, that because <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> has devoted followers and a highly organized campaign, he might be able to turn out his supporters anyway and such a development might hurt his opponent, <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>. But regardless of the effect, he said, discouraging any voter `` negates the electoral process'' and is wrong. Legislation to address the problem through instituting a uniform poll-closing time across the country's six time zones has not been able to get through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Leftist guerrillas have stepped up attacks in the capital, staging bold daylight raids and threatening to fulfill their pledge to bring the 9-year-old war to the cities. Urban commandos last week hit the national guard headquarters with mortar and rifle fire, killing four soldiers and wounding 38 people. It was the largest attack in the city in seven years. `` This is only the beginning,'' the rebels boasted in a broadcast on their clandestine Radio Venceremos. `` Prepare yourselves Salvadorans, the hour is near.'' The barracks attack capped more than a month of increased activity by the <ORGANIZATION> Farbabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of five leftist armies battling the U.S.-backed and - supplied government since 1979 The rebels say they are showing their strength. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy says the guerrillas are losing in the country and the city attacks are an act of desperation and a search for publicity. The ultra-convervative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, blames the raids on a `` power vacuum'' in President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is ill with terminal cancer and, for the first time in years, the March elections will include leftist candidates. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> linked renewed rebel activity to the presidential elections and a Nov. 14 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` With the world's, or at least the hemispheric spotlight on them, they are using dramatic gestures to say ` we're here,''' the ambassador said. The guerrillas promised to take the war to the cities early last year, but until recently their attacks were infrequent and small. However, since Sept. 13 the guerrillas have maintained pressure in rural areas and moved into new regions of this Massachussetts-sized nation of 5 million. `` As of today I know what the war is. Before it had been only on the television,'' said <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>, a resident of <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION>, after an Oct. 6 attack on the town 12 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. That same day commandos using grenade launchers staged a rapid-fire morning attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. On Oct. 18, two car bombs exploded in parking lots in the posh Escalon neighborhood. `` There are no more areas of tranquility for the guardians of exploitation. It is not fair that the bombs and explosions are heard only in the rural zones, in the homes of the poor,'' the rebels said in a broadcast. The military has increased patrols in the sprawling capital, but the 1 million or so inhabitants seem unaffected by the war. Working-class neighborhoods still teem with activity. Crowds cram the outdoor cafes in the chic <PERSON> Zona </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>, scene of a 1985 hit-and-run shooting that killed six Americans, including four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines. However, the guerrillas' occasional calls for transportation stoppages are largely respected. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which overseas $ 1.5 million in aid per day to the Salvadoran government, says the guerrillas are frustrated because they have n't been able to topple the elected <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> administration. `` There's no doubt of increased actions -LRB- in the capital -RRB- in the last couple of months,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in an interview last week. `` But blowing up a hamburger joint is not a great demonstration of military strength.'' Asked about Wednesday's national guard attack, he said: `` They can do that on occasion and will be able to do that for some time. But it does n't particularly demonstrate military prowess.'' More than 65,000 Salvadorans, many of them civilians, have been killed in the war. The last attack as large as the national guard attack came in January 1981, when the guerrillas launched a failed `` final offensive.'' Groups traditionally sympathetic to the guerrillas, including the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the recent actions, especially the car bombs. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, a member of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of three leftist parties, also said civilians should be respected but added that the barracks attack was a legitimate act of war. `` These are the effects and not the causes of the war. The causes are internal, produced by extreme poverty, the oligarchy and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> said.

 Far longer than it had to be, and too nasty as well, the 1988 presidential campaign is as certain to trigger calls for reform as it is to elect the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The money, the tone and the timing are ripe for examination whether Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the winner on Tuesday. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory would send the Democrats into another agonizing round of internal debate. This was the guy the Democrats wanted to run against, the wimp who could n't win. Republicans are less inclined to try to reinvent the wheel after every defeat. But a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> victory would accelerate the conservative drive to purge moderates and create a more ideologically oriented party. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory would revive talk by Republicans of a political realignment in their favor and would force Democrats to confront new evidence that Americans like divided government _ <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> presidents and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congresses </ORGANIZATION>. Whichever candidate wins, the big loser could be <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Politicians are growing weary of the state whose caucuses dominate the first two months of the nomination campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished an embarrassing third in the 1988 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, reason enough for him to support any move to diminish the state's influence On the Democratic side, the state often seems a collection of special interest groups intent on demanding that candidates take positions they'll regret during the general election campaign. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> does its best to diminish <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s impact by consistently reversing the results of the caucuses. But the early <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary does n't have much more support than the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. Beyond the purely political consequences of Tuesday's outcome, the sheer ugliness of this campaign ought to prompt calls for change. A familiar figure returned to prominence in 1988 _ the fat cat. Through much of the campaign, the candidates disappeared from public view after dark. They were n't getting some rest or curling up with position papers. They were schmoozing with $ 100,000 contributors. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> liked to say he was `` more interested in the lathe operators and the machine operators'' than in the `` sharp operators'' on Wall Street. But his campaign spent a lot of time getting the candidate together with the operators willing to write big checks toward a $ 50 million fund-raising goal. The Democrats were only trying to catch up with what the Republicans had been doing for years _ raising big bucks for `` party-building'' _ political activity not covered by federal limits on contributions. That `` soft money'' was a campaign asset over and above the $ 46.1 million in public funds given to each candidate. A lot of the money went for good causes such as voter registration drives, but it also returned the parties and the candidates to an uncomfortable dependence upon fat cats. Maybe $ 100 contributors will have the same access to a President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or a President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as $ 100,000 contributors. Maybe not. A common saying during much of this as well as past past campaigns was that `` voters have n't started paying attention yet.'' For months and months and months, we were told that voters were ignoring the whole process. Then why in heaven's name will the 1992 presidential campaign begin on Nov. 9, 1988? The simple answer is the need to raise millions of dollars. The only solution probably is to have a late-starting candidate win his party's nomination and go on to be elected president. Politicians are like television programmers, they always try to duplicate the most recent hit show. The most disturbing aspect of the 1988 campaign was the negative tone. Can that be changed? Not so long as it works. Every politician who knows the road to election is the low one wo n't hesitate to take it.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told voters today the Republicans were `` taking you for granted'' and predicted he would upset <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Election Day. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued his populist appeal as he addressed a warehouse rally of 5,000. `` We're on the side of people who live off a family budget, not a family fortune,'' he said. `` He's on their side. We're on your side.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted new polls showing him closing the gap. `` I think the Republican Party began celebrating a little early, do n't you? They were taking you for granted,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had another grueling day planned today, with more rallies in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and a joint appearance with running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before heading to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to spend the night. The Democratic presidential nominee received a rousing welcome in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Friday night, marching with four former rivals and 15,000 people in a traditional torchlight parade and later addressing a rowdy rally attended by another 6,000 supporters. `` In 1960 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> went into that last weekend down eight points in the polls _ We're doing better than that,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You can feel that surge and you can feel that excitement.'' His voice has been raspy for days because of the busy schedule, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounded Friday night as if his voice was making a comeback. `` We know this race is not over,'' he said to thunderous applause at the post-parade rally. `` We're going to work even harder and every day until those polls close on the 8th of November and we're going to retire Mr <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalled a joke used by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in the 1960 campaign, when then-Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was trying to succeed President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. He amended it for the current race, in which Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is vying to succeed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The lead elephant is about to leave the circus,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the animal that serves as the symbol of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` And the No. 2 elephant has stopped dead in his tracks. He's coasting and we're fighting, all over this country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, to support their contention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is closing fast on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, cited a new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll that showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 51 percent to 44 percent. They also said internal campaign polls said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was now ahead in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, must-win states in his upset formula. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trails in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and would need to win at least one of them if he is to realize his plan, which also counts on victories in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a number of smaller states. It appears the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has given up on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and will attempt to win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides had been talking about returning to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> but no such stop is scheduled and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may make a second appearance in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tonight if arrangements can be worked out. Polls have shown <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a consistent lead in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp insists <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, is still capable of delivering his state. At the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> event, as he did earlier in the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent adoption of the new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> battle cry _ `` I'm on your side.'' `` Four days before the election, after all the ads and distortions and the rest of it, he says he's on your side.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Who's he kidding. Who's he kidding.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting a capital gains tax break the Democrat called a boon for the rich and declared: `` He's not on our side. He's on their side. And the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to reject him on Tuesday.'' Marching in the parade with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were former rivals <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. Also on hand was <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who rejoined her husband after spending several days in a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> hospital with a respiratory virus.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student whose father is a top government computer security expert created the `` virus'' that slowed 6,000 computers nationwide, said a report today, and the school found that the young man possessed unauthorized computer codes. But <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> staff may not be able to determine if <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a graduate student in the university's computer science program, was the source of the virus, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, vice president of information technologies at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference today in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Three sources with detailed knowledge of the case told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 23, whom friends describe as `` brilliant,'' devised the virus as an experiment. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> officials did not suspect the virus may have originated in their computer system until reporters asked questions Friday night after the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report was published, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. `` We are investigating his computer files at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, and so far we have determined that his account contains files that appear to hold passwords for some computers at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> to which he is not entitled,'' lynn said. `` We also have discovered that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' account contains a list of passwords substantially similar to those found in the virus.'' Passwords are the codes needed to gain access to computer systems. The student's father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, is chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> devoted to protecting computers from outside attack. He has written widely on the security of the Unix operating system, the computer master program that was the target of the computer virus. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, reached today at his home in <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said his son would not be available for comment until next week. Computer viruses behave like biological viruses in that they duplicate themselves and spread from computer to computer, through `` electronic mail'' systems or other networks. They consume computer processing power and storage space, and some _ but apparently not this one _ destroy stored information. The virus was introduced into Arpanet, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> computer network linking universities, research centers and defense operations, officials said. It was intended to remain there undetected, slowly making copies that would move from computer to computer, the Times said. But a design error caused it instead to replicate out of control, the Times reported Friday, quoting an anonymous caller to the newspaper who said he was an associate of the program's designer. The virus jammed more than 6,000 computers nationwide starting Wednesday. But it apparently caused no damage other than lost research time and the thousands of costly hours that computer scientists and programmers were spending to remove it from their systems. By Friday, most universities and research centers had turned their computers back on. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strawn </PERSON>, director of the Computation Center at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, described the impact of the virus at his school as `` a slight case of the sniffles.'' <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houweling </PERSON>, vice provost for information technology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said no files were damaged but many hours of work were needed to clean out `` duplicate waste files'' the virus created. <PERSON> Hans-Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, a computer expert at the <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, school, said the main effect of the incident was to call attention to the system's vulnerability. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told the Times that the virus `` has raised the public awareness to a considerable degree. It is likely to make people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in the future.'' Sources told the Times that his son flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday and planned to hire a lawyer and meet with officials in charge of the Arpanet network to discuss the incident. Computer scientists said the younger <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> worked in recent summers at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. One of his projects included rewriting the communications security software for most computers that run the Unix operating system, which <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T developed, the Times reported. Computer scientists who are disassembling the virus to learn how it worked said they have been impressed with its power and cleverness. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 56, told the Times that it was `` the work of a bored graduate student.'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON>, the graduate faculty representative in <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s computer science department, said he chuckled when he heard that quote `` We try to keep them from getting bored,'' he said. `` I guess we did n't try hard enough.''

 Seething hatred of the Jews, fanned by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s propagandists, exploded 50 years ago in the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' well-coordinated night of ransacking, torching and beating called `` Kristallnacht.'' Boastfully dubbed Crystal Night by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> because of the sparkling shards of glass from thousands of smashed windows, that single night of terror was also the dawn of the murderous seven-year Holocaust. The Nazis eventually killed an estimated 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of others they labeled `` undesirables.'' Throughout <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Nov. 9-10, 1938, <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> rampaged against Jews in major cities as well as those few left in small towns after years of persecution. The balance of the terrifying destruction, according to official <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> count: 195 synagogues and 7,500 businesses destroyed, thousands of homes ransacked. Officially, 36 Jews were slain, some as they fled burning buildings. Other accounts, however, indicate that at least 1,118 synagogues were vandalized and as many as 1,000 Jews were killed or committed suicide. Thousands more Jews _ men, women and children _ were beaten. More than 30,000 were arrested and shipped off to concentration camps in the first major step in the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate European Jews. The action, which became known as the `` Night of Broken Glass'' in English, stunned the outside world and bluntly heralded the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' intentions to `` Aryanize'' society and business. Germans in both East and West have for months been making elaborate plans to mark the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, including solemn ceremonies, panel discussions and new publications. Even half a century later, the memory of the terror haunts its victims. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON> was an 11-year-old in the town of <LOCATION> Arnswalde </LOCATION> _ now <LOCATION> Choszczno </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We were sleeping behind shutters with the windows closed,'' <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON> recalled in an interview. `` We were jerked out of our sleep by the crashing glass. We heard the screams: ` The synaogue is burning!' `` My father screamed, ` Yes, the sky's all red!' We lived just 500 meters from the synagogue. We were hiding behind him for three hours. We were shaking from fear and terror. Uniformed <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> rushed into our house. They arrested my father without saying a word,'' he said. `` My sister, <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON>, and I were crying terribly,'' added the 61-year-old <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON>, now head of the Jewish home for the elderly in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` My sister, mother and I had to leave Arnswalde within three days.'' <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON>'s mother, father and 13-year-old sister all died in the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON>, also sent to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, later saved himself by plunging into the snow when Nazi machine-gunners mowed down prisoners in January 1945. In what the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> called `` spontaneous anti-Jewish demonstrations,'' Kristallnacht raged across the German <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, including <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the recently annexed Sudetenland region of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In addition to homes, businesses and synagogues, the Nazi gangs ransacked Jewish hospitals, orphanages and homes for the elderly. In the city of <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Weimar </LOCATION>, all Jewish men aged 18 to 80 were rounded up and forced into a local gymnasium. `` Some of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> especially took to task Jews whom they personally knew, to vent their fury on them,'' said local B'nai B'rith president <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` We had to line up and march around to the sounds of the <LOCATION> Horst-Wessel </LOCATION> song -LRB- a Nazi favorite -RRB-. Then we were commanded to scream ` Death to the Jews'' and we had to do it,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. Some were savagely beaten with whips, he said. `` Then we were loaded into buses and brought to <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION>, where we arrived at dawn,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> recalled in historian <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz </PERSON>'s recently published book, `` The Jews in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 1933-45. In other cities, Jews were herded into courtyards before the men were separated from their families and sent to concentration camps. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Senger </PERSON>, then a non-practicing Jew from a staunchly Communist family, witnessed the outcome of Kristallnacht in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where some of the worst violence took place. `` On the morning of the 10th, I went to the factory where I worked, and on the way to the factory, I ran into a secretary. She said: ` Have you heard the synagogue is burning?''' he recalled. <PERSON> Senger </PERSON> described the mushroom cloud of smoke coming from the direction of the Boerneplatz. When he reached the synagogue, he said smoke was billowing from the roof, flames leaping through the windows. `` Hundreds of people were standing nearby,'' he said. `` The area was blocked off by police. The fire department was there, but they were n't trying to put out the fire. They had instructions to let the synagogue burn, but to keep nearby buildings from burning. `` I stood there and never heard any words of approval or applause or bravos. The people looked stiffly and silently into the fire. No one critcized it either. The fear was too great. `` That was the first time I felt I belonged to them, I belonged there, that's my people. My synagogue was burning. I really felt that I was a Jew,'' the 69-year-old retired journalist told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` I saw they were rounding up the Jews and putting them on trucks, that same day. The Jews were being mistreated and beaten.'' <PERSON> Senger </PERSON> survived in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> by hiding from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and using false documents. Much to the annoyance of Nazi finance chief <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Goering </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kristallnacht </ORGANIZATION> had an unforeseen and nearly disastrous impact. The damage, calculated at 25 million reichsmarks, worth about $ 6.25 million, shocked German insurance companies. They noted that just replacing the broken glass would hurt the Third Reich, since the glass had to be imported with much-needed hard currency. `` I wish you had killed 200 Jews instead of destroying so many valuables,'' <PERSON> Goering </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heydrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> fanatic who gave the Teletyped orders for Kristallnacht. Eventually, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> confiscated the insurance proceeds and slapped the Jews with a $ 250 million fine. Fifty years later, the anniversary is still creating conflict, including debate over the best way to mark the day and the extent to which government leaders should participate. Roman Catholic bishops from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> last month issued a joint statement that sharply questioned <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders' failure 50 years ago to publicly condemn the Nazi night of terror. The bishops implied that <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> `` failings'' were partly responsible for the Holocaust. In September, <PERSON> Ignaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubis </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Jewish Community, stunned the government when he publicly urged Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to have President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> write <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s speech <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has occasionally upset West German Jews with what they consider insensitivity toward their concerns. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, on the other hand, has gained the Jews' admiration for urging Germans to face the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. West German Jews also frequently object to the word Kristallnacht, saying it minimizes the atrocities that followed the rampages. They prefer the term `` Pogrom Night.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1933, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had 530,000 Jews. About 32,000 Jews live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the estimated number of practicing Jews is 450-600, with no permanent rabbi.

<HEAD>75th Anniversary Of Aqueduct Running Owens River Water To LA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There was a carnival atmosphere when 30,000 people gathered on a dusty hillside 75 years ago to see water carried almost 226 miles through the city's new <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqueduct </LOCATION> from the eastern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` There it is! Take it!'' shouted <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON>, the city water superintendent. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> took it, and more. Conceived with foresight, planned with guile, built in determination and surrounded by profiteering and hyperbole, the aqueduct, which opened Nov. 5, 1913, has spun a compelling history. `` The aqueduct to the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was the foundation of the modern megalopolis. It allowed <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to invent itself,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahrl </PERSON>, whose 1982 book `` Water and Power'' is considered an authoritative history of the project. `` What was done in the early 1900s is still very much with us,'' said <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, whose book `` Vision or Villainy'' is another definitive study. `` The city of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has been on a growth mentality really all the way.'' Water allowed <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to make the desert bloom. It made arid real estate in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> suddenly valuable and led to widespread speculation. But water diverted southward to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> also prevented the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> from blossoming into the center of commerce that its turn-of-the-century residents wanted it to be. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials ensured this by buying land in the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> _ at first covertly to acquire the water rights and later imperiously to take irrigated farmland out of production and save even more water for the city. Valley residents reacted by repeatedly bombing the aqueduct, and armed night riders took to the roads. The city responded with truckloads of armed guards. Today, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> owns about 300,000 acres in <LOCATION> Inyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mono </LOCATION> counties along the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> border. Storytellers sympathetic to the ranchers portrayed the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as a democratic <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> and the sinuous aqueduct as the evil serpent causing their ruination. Nor could Hollywood resist the temptation of embellishing the tale with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> in the 1935 film `` New Frontier'' and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> in the 1974 movie `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>,'' a tale of graft and greed. `` I would classify ` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>' as a fine film and a great story _ but not good history,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON>, the self-educated ditch digger who masterminded the aqueduct, had a tragic downfall. He pronounced the new Saint <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> northwest of the city safe, hours before it collapsed in 1928. More than 400 people were killed, homes and businesses were washed away and <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON> resigned in disgrace. <PERSON> Kahrl </PERSON> and others have concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> was neither benevolent nor malicious in its treatment of the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It was just coldly practical. `` The irony,'' said <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON>'s granddaughter, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, now 65, `` is that all the land <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> acquired in the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is pristine and gorgeous and it's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that's been trashed.'' `` So many mini malls. I think the developers have gotten away with murder in the last 20 years.''

<HEAD>New Grand Jury Reviewing Iran-Contra Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Iran-Contra prosecutors are using a new grand jury to review testimony from last year's congressional hearings in an apparent investigation of possible perjury by witnesses in the case. The prosecutors working for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> have been playing videotapes of the House-Senate hearings to the federal grand jury that has been meeting regularly on the case for about three weeks, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, it is unclear who might be suspected of lying under oath, either to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or to the original Iran-Contra grand jury that returned indictments earlier this year. But the panel could compare testimony a witness gave to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with facts developed by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation, as well as sworn statements that the individual or others made to the original Iran-Contra grand jury. So far, the grand jury has not heard any live witnesses, according to the sources, indicating prosecutors are laying groundwork for the investigation by playing the videotapes of the 1987 hearings. The grand jury has been meeting two or three times a week for several hours. It hears other cases unrelated to the Iran-Contra affair. The new grand jury, unlike the one that indicted former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other figures in the Iran-Contra affair, is free to review congressional testimony given under grants of limited immunity from prosecution for evidence of perjury. Such grants of `` use immunity'' prohibit prosecutors from using a witness' testimony or evidence derived from it to prosecute that individual in court on criminal charges. The immunized testimony, however, could be used as evidence in a perjury case if the witness lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or a grand jury. It could also be used as evidence that another person committed a crime, raising the possibility the new panel could develop leads from the congressional hearings that could not be followed up by the original Iran-Contra grand jury. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and most of his prosecutors carefully isolated themselves from news coverage of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee hearings to avoid exposure to the immunized congressional testimony. The independent counsel did not want to be left open to defense accusations that his office illegally relied on the immunized testimony as evidence to prosecute the Iran-Contra defendants. He also took measures to ensure that members of the original Iran-Contra grand jury were not exposed to immunized congressional testimony. The team of prosecutors presenting evidence to the new grand jury is led by <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, one of the few members of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff who has been exposed to the congressional testimony. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s appearance at the proceedings signaled that the new Iran-Contra grand jury is reviewing immunized congressional testimony and that perjury is a likely subject of the inquiry. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in court last spring that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> had been exposed to testimony given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and was not participating in the prosecution of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> was continuing to do unspecified work on his staff. North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> testified on Capitol Hill under limited grants of immunity from prosecution. They are accused of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting millions of dollars of proceeds from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the fourth defendant in the case, gave congressional testimony without any immunity from prosecution. No dates have been set for any of the four trials ordered in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panels openly expressed doubts about credibility of some of the congressional witnesses, including <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. In their recently published book `` Men of Zeal,'' two members of the committee, Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, note that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` said 184 times he could not recall events about which he was questioned.'' The memory lapses by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rear admiral known for his keen intellect `` raised serious questions about <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s credibility,'' the two senators wrote <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff would also be in a better position to evaluate the congressional testimony that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> gave about secret Swiss bank accounts and dummy corporations through which the arms money flowed. The congressional panels never saw the records of the secret bank accounts, which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> only obtained after protracted legal proceedings in Swiss courts. In addition, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has the cooperation of <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, an American lawyer and financier whose <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> company has handled many of <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s business affairs for many years. Unlike the defendants in the case, a number of figures in the Iran-Contra affair testified both on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and before the original Iran-Contra grand jury. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is not barred from using congressional testimony that was not given under immunity grants. But his staff and the original grand jury generally avoided exposure to accounts of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceedings so they would n't learn about the testimony of immunized witnesses from questions that were put to other witnesses. But the new grand jury would be free to compare the different versions of testimony by many witnesses who appeared before the original Iran-Contra grand jury and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>TV Campaign, Often Negative, Ending With Splash Costing Millions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential campaign shaped by `` sound bites'' and attack ads is finishing the same way it began: on television. With their color schemes and TelePrompTers, anthems and pledges, flags and balloons and children galore, the party conventions last summer were made for TV. And television will also host the campaign windups _ a half-hour of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> followed by a half-hour of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on each of the three major networks on election eve. Cost per candidate: nearly $ 1 million. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> program showcases the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor answering questions in a town meeting setting and contains footage of his family and his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effort summarizes the vice president's achievements, beliefs and plans for the nation. The two candidates set new records this year for money spent on commercials -LRB- expected to top $ 30 million apiece -RRB- and for free air time in 10-and 20-second `` sound bites'' on the news as well as talk and interview shows. Some say the campaigns also set a new record for negative advertising. And polls indicate TV ads had plenty of influence. Twenty-five percent of probable voters in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted in late October said political advertising had helped them decide how to vote. That compares to a 1984 post-election poll in which 12 percent of registered voters said commercials had helped them decide. `` The test of a good president is n't who comes up with the best commercial,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, in what sounded like an admission of defeat on the media front. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads helped him define not only the issues of the campaign but his largely unknown opponent as well. `` America ca n't afford that risk,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack ads said of the prospect of electing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whom he bashed on crime, taxes, the environment and defense. `` Ready on day one to be a great president,'' pro-Bush ads said, depicting him as an experienced world leader with a warm human side. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' advertising effort, beset by indecision, settled in the final days on two populist taglines: `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come'' and `` Dukakis-Bentsen. On your side.'' The themes reflected his campaign's end-game focus on the economic concerns of workers and the middle class. Foremost among the general election ads that left lingering impressions was a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spot called `` Revolving Door,'' a stark 30-second procession of inmates filing in and out of a revolving iron gate, capped with an ominous aerial view of prison grounds and a guard tower. The narrator says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed the death penalty and `` gave weekend furloughs to first degree murderers not eligible for parole. While out, many committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and many are still at large.'' On the screen the number 268 flashes, implying that's how many first-degree murderers escaped and committed crimes. In fact only one did _ <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. That ad, combined with another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercial called `` Crime Quiz'' _ and the millions spent by independent groups hitting on the same themes _ helped fuel an image of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime. The governor was slow to respond, though he eventually came up with ads citing figures showing that crime has dropped substantially in his state while he has been in charge. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also struck back with a series of `` Packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' ads that created a furor among consultants and columnists. Too confusing, too elitist, they said of the spots, which showed actors playing cynical <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handlers trying to disguise their candidate's alleged shortcomings. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign maintains the `` packaging'' series served its purpose by halting a slide in the polls. The series soon gave way to more traditional attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record and judgment, plus a well-received ad in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speaks directly into the camera about `` a father's concern'' for the future. Day care was n't such a challenge, drugs were n't such a threat when he raised his family, he tells viewers. Today, `` to stay even, most families have to have two working parents. ... If I were a young father today, I'd want to know that my government was n't blind to the changes in my life.'' The dominance of television was highlighted by two commercials that featured none other than, you guessed it, commercials. One, an upbeat musical spot for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, shows people watching excerpts of upbeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ads on TV. The other, perhaps more reflective of the campaign's tone, shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> watching a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attack ad. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> snaps off the TV set in disgust. `` Full of lies and he knows it,'' declares the Democrat. `` This is n't about defense issues. It's about dragging the truth into the gutter.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, proclaiming himself `` at the end of a long political journey,'' pressed his case today for the anointing of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his successor. `` All the progress we have made is on the line,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery at a Republican rally at <ORGANIZATION> Macomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. With less than three days remaining before voters go to the polls, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned, `` This election is n't over yet, not by a long shot.'' From this <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was traveling to <ORGANIZATION> Mesquite </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to speak in a rodeo arena. In his weekly radio address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also put in a no-holds-barred plug for his vice president. `` Yes, my fellow Americans, there is a choice, a very important choice _ a vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a vote for optimism ... It's an endorsement of what we've done these past eight years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president, who taped his address prior to departing on Saturday's campaign swing, urged voters to pay attention to each and every issue before them. `` There are ballot propositions on issues from gun control to the size of cow stalls, and yes, everyone of these choices is vital, every one is crucial. Every one gives you an opportunity to say, this is what I want the future to look like. This is the country I want to live in,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The freedom to vote as one wishes is what separates <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from totalitarian regimes, where the elections are `` sick jokes,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Did you know that in the most recent election in the Stalinist nation of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, the vote tally was 1,820,652 to one?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. On Monday, he returns for his third round of campaign appearances in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the richest prize with 47 electoral votes. `` We're now at the end of a long political journey that marks for me my last campaign as an officeholder,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I'm here today to bring home the simple fact that all the progress we have made is on the line,'' he told his audience. `` Today's activities are part of a get-out-the vote campaign and I just want to tell each one of you go to the polls on Tuesday and get your friends to go too.'' `` This election is n't over yet, not by a long shot, and as <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> once said, we must continue the struggle until victory is won,'' he said. His message about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponent, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and other Democrats was the same as it has been: `` Whether it's their opposition to voluntary prayer in school, support for gun control, or the left wing judges appointed in a state like <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, or a weak-kneed defense policy: Their views can only be described by the dreaded L-word: liberal, liberal, liberal.'' `` I just happen to think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is on a roll,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Speaking at an open-air rally at a <LOCATION> Voorhees </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, shopping mall Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the voters' choice on Tuesday will be `` just as clear'' as when they chose him over <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> scoffed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stewardship in his three terms as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Between 1986 and 1987, while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a whole was creating more new jobs than the rest of the industrial world put together, under the governor, his state ranked an abysmal 30th among our states in the annual rate of total job growth,'' said the president, himself the former governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` And with yesterday's papers reporting a state bank account overdrawn by as much as $ 190 million for a month, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day,'' he said. The president was referring to reports appearing Thursday that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> government was running a deficit and would have to increase revenues or reduce spending to meet the state constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. Heaping scorn on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim to crowds that he is `` on your side,'' he said, `` Now, let me ask you _ biggest job growth in the industrial world or one of the slower rates in the nation and a mess like that; you tell me, who's on your side, the liberal governor or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' `` Yes, the choice is just as clear as the choice in 1980 and 1984,'' he said, declaring that the Democrats offer `` liberal tax and spend, economic stagnation, international weakness,'' while the Republicans offer limited government, strong defense and firmness with the Soviets. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already ahead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> polls, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also campaigned for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, an underdog in a hard-fought race with Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>.

 A member of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> predicted Saturday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will establish diplomatic relations next year. He also said his country's occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has lasted too long <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> made the comments to reporters after arriving in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> following a monthlong lecture tour in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> also reported renewed efforts to resolve the fate of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen missing in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` I think that once the new government will be installed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, perhaps by mid-year or the end of next year we will resume recognition of diplomatic relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, a former South Vietnamese deputy prime minister. During his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration officials as well as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and `` received very encouraging and positive signs'' from them. He did not name the people he met. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> also met with American businessmen during the visit, which he said was part of a campaign to lure Western investment in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The nation is one of the poorest in the world and needs <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid and investment that is now banned by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is making progress in efforts to end its 10-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The country has promised to withdraw its 100,000 to 120,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of 1990, a condition <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has imposed before it will recognize the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> said his government was setting up offices throughout <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for people to report any knowledge of missing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers. The information would then be used for a joint U.S.-Vietnamese search for remains of missing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel, he said. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 to end massacres by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government and attacks on Vietnamese communities along the border between the two countries. `` But the mistake that we have done I think is that we have stayed there too long,'' he said. `` Should we have withdrawn perhaps a few years ago, we would not have provoked the kind of criticism that we have now.'' He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is willing to withdraw all its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and allow a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force to take over in exchange for guarantees that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will not return to power. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> served as a deputy prime minister of the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government and was jailed for a year after the capital, <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, fell to the Communists in 1975.

 A 45-year-old father of six has been convicted of molesting and sodomizing two teen-age daughters for half of their lives and faces a sentence of life in prison. The conviction of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> ended a weeklong trial marked by tearful testimony from the daughters, ages 18 and 16. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, a roofing contractor, cross-examined his daughters himself on the first day of the trial. The 18-year-old testified that her father had fondled and molested her since she was 9; the 16-year-old said her father began molesting her at age 8. <PERSON> Deidre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, 18, cried Friday when the verdict was read and said her father's conviction was too severe. `` I think it was real unfair,'' Miss <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said. `` He does n't deserve to be in there -LRB- jail -RRB- _ I've been there.'' In the pre-trial phase of the case, Judge <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> had jailed <PERSON> Deidre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, for more than a week for refusing to testify. During the trial, <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> repeatedly chastised <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who was acting as his co-counsel, for what the judge called attempts to slow the pace of the trial. In his closing arguments, <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and claimed courts use `` the most extreme form of psychological warfare to coerce children to give false testimony to convict parents of sexual abuse.'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johstono </PERSON> also quoted <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, telling the jury in his summation, `` It is better to have a millstone around your neck and be thrown into the sea than to lead a child to sin.'' He told the jury there had, indeed, been brainwashing but that it had been done by <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> and his wife, not the government. After deliberating for morre than three hours, the jury convicted <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> on eight counts of child molestation, aggravated child molestation, sodomy and aggravated sodomy. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> held without bond until sentencing on Thursday. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison for the aggravated sodomy conviction and more than 150 years in prison on the others. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>'s wife said her husband likely would appeal the verdict. Her next fight, she said, will be to regain custody of her children from <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials. All of the <ORGANIZATION> Dickeys </ORGANIZATION>' children except <PERSON> Deidre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the oldest, are in custody of the county social services agency. The couple's 16-year-old daughter, a younger daughter and two young sons are in foster care The couple's 13-year-old daughter is staying at the county children's shelter. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> also was charged with molesting the 13-year-old daughter, but prosecutors agreed to drop the charge to spare the girl the trauma of testifying. <PERSON> Johstono </PERSON> said the verdict affirmed that <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who had no prior criminal record, was `` a very sick individual.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Tishomingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was leading 16-14 with seven seconds to go when tailback <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> got the ball, ran 55 yards to the end zone, laid down and waited for the clock to run out for a two-point safety. But it was the wrong end zone and the two points went to the other school ... and that was exactly what the Tishomingo coach wanted. Tishomingo needed a victory by four or more points over <ORGANIZATION> Falkner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to advance to the playoffs. So Tishomingo Coach <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> weighed the chances of his team going 40 yards on one play against <PERSON> Falkner </PERSON>'s sturdy defense or making a long field goal. Finally he told his quarterback and son, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, to give the ball to <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> for the two-point safety. It took the younger <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> so much time talking his skeptical teammates into the play that they were charged a five-yard delay of game penalty. `` When <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> told them what we were going to do, one of our tackles said, ` Your daddy must be crazy,''' the coach said. But what <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s plan did was tie the score, 16-16, to put the game into overtime and allow <LOCATION> Tishomingo </LOCATION> to win 22-16 and earn its Class 1A playoff berth. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s mother -RRB- turned to a friend and asked if her son had gone crazy,'' the coach said of the surprise play. `` Both sides were silent.

<HEAD>Alaska Voters Consider Fate of `Unqualified' Judge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> has never been disciplined or censured in his nine years as a judge, but he fears voters may oust him from the bench on Tuesday because a state agency has branded him unqualified. The agency's recommendation that voters remove the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge has drawn attention to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s unique system of judicial review. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is the only state with an official panel that reviews its judges and publishes findings about their judicial fitness. In other states, bar associations sometimes issue ratings. In the 12 years since the council began making recommendations, <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> is the first <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge found unqualified. Only four other judges, all from lower courts, have received the unwanted distinction. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is used as a model for other jurisdictions which are thinking about adopting some method to evaluate judges already sitting on the bench,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former state attorney general and the council's executive director. `` We have been told by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that we give out more information than any other jurisdiction,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` That's not to say our system is entirely satisfactory, because it is n't.'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s governor appoints judges from a short list of nominees submitted by the council, but all state judges periodically go before voters. The recommendations about judges up for retention are published in the state voters' pamphlet and in most of the state's daily newspapers. In <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON>'s case, he scored poorly in integrity, judicial temperament and overall performance, especially as ranked by his fellow jurists. He is the first judge since the surveys began who lawyers and judges have scored less than acceptable in integrity. That, more than anything else, led to the negative recommendation, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The council of three lawyers, three non-lawyers and the chief justice of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> usually recommends retention. Of the 17 judges up for retention Nov. 8, only <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> was found unworthy of a `` yes'' vote. The recommendations are based on a review of court records, complaints, findings of the state <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, interviews, investigations by the council staff, and surveys of lawyers, judges, magistrates, police and probation officers. <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, said it's unclear to voters what is meant by integrity. `` Are you talking about his honesty? Is his work not any good? Are you talking about his character? The thing is, it's not focused,'' <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said. `` When you talk about somebody's integrity, you really strike at the core of his being,'' <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said. `` The implication, given the intelligence of the people involved, is that there's something horrendously wrong with Judge <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> or his colleagues would n't vote this way. <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> noted that his record as a judge and attorney is clean. `` I've never been sanctioned or disciplined or censured, either privately or publicly, by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, or by the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> when I practiced law,'' he said. He attributed his poor rating to some lawyers' dissatisfaction with a program he started to speed the disposition of cases and make attorneys more accountable. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said the rating system encourages `` guilt by association.'' `` The council ca n't say but in the most general terms what the problem is, and then the accused ca n't defend himself,'' he said. Critics also say survey results often are based on a small number of respondents and can be skewed by anonymous attorneys seeking revenge against a judge. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> pointed out that in the <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> survey, 528 attorneys and judges and 103 police and probation officers responded. `` The people who are rating Judge <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> are giving it thought, and in a sufficient number _ in my mind, at least _ that it overcomes any real possibility of a conspiracy being engineered,'' he said. The verdict is not yet in on the effect of the council's recommendations on voters Of the four judges previously found unqualified, two were ousted in their second retention election. The other two were retained but later resigned.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says U.S. and Pakistan Ruining Geneva Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, stepping up pressure on Afghan rebels to halt their advances, said Saturday the agreement on Soviet withdrawal is near ruin because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani arms supplies to the insurgents. The statement to legislators in the Afghan capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, followed an announcement Friday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had stopped removing its soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because of increased attacks by Islamic guerrillas. Soviet SS-1 missiles and sophisticated MiG-27 warplanes also have been sighted in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the past week. The concerted diplomatic and military pressure indicated the guerrilla offensive against the pro-Soviet Afghan government has pushed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> past its level of tolerance. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the newly appointed Soviet ambassador, said the supply of weapons to guerrillas by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` is a very serious blow to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords which practically torpedoes them.'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, in addition to being the ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, is a first deputy foreign minister with considerable influence and experience negotiating the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s exit from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> spoke during a meeting of the foreign affairs commissions of the two houses of the Afghan Parliament. His remarks were carried by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` The time has come for a new international debate of all aspects of the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and around it, because foreign powers _ <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ are involved here that push the opposition toward continuing the blood-letting,'' he said. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> could play an important role in any new debate on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Saturday for <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks, did not comment on the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> developments during brief remarks to reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> helped negotiate the agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April that led to the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal. The agreement was signed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> say the supplying of arms to the Afghan rebels is a clear violation of the agreement. But diplomats say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tacitly agreed at the time of the signing that one side could continue arming its client if the other did the same. In keeping with terms of the agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew half of its 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> between May 15-Aug. 15 The withdrawal is to be completed by Feb. 15. But <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>, a first deputy foreign minister, told reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday the withdrawal was suspended for the time being because of rebel bombings, mortar and rocket attacks. He also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sent fresh soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with more powerful weapons, but he said the quantity of troops and weapons has not increased. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Soviet moves `` raise speculation that they are n't going to live up to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords.'' <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still is committed to withdrawing all its soldiers according to schedule, but added that Soviet compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord depended on whether the other signers obeyed it as well. That indicated the Soviets may be considering keeping soldiers in the country after the Feb. 15 deadline. None of the national daily newspapers published Saturday reported <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>'s comment that the troop withdrawal was suspended. Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one pro-Soviet government with another and remained to fight the insurgency. More than 13,000 of them died in the fighting.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address Saturday: My fellow Americans, after a vibrant and fractious and exciting year, we will at last be going to the polls on Tuesday and exercising our most important right _ the right to choose our future _ the right to vote. There's nothing more glorious than the blessing that is our God-given freedom to choose those who will lead us, and there's no sight more moving than a lone American walking into that voting booth casting a ballot in secret, and thereby determining the destiny of this great country. And make no mistake, the choice this year at the top of the ballot is crucial. Do n't listen to the cynical pundits who tell you this election is n't about the issues. Oh yes, it is. In fact, it's about more than the issues It's about the direction this country's going to take over the next four years and beyond It's about the kind of economy we want, the kind of defense we want, the kind of values we want. The choice is yours. But yes, my fellow Americans, there is a choice _ a very, very important choice. A vote for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a vote for optimism, an expression of faith in the American experiment. It's an endorsement of what we've done these past eight years, and of our heartfelt promise that tomorrow and the days to come will be brighter still. No one knows better than a man who has sought the highest office in this land what an awesome responsibility it is to be the vessel of change, the selection of a people in control of their present and their future. It's truly humbling. And I'd like once again to thank all of you who placed your faith in me, and I'd like to tip my hat to those who supported others, but their took their responsibility as citizens of a democratic society seriously and with care. I have heard your voices, like those before me and those after me. I have heard your voices and I hope I have justified your faith. You know the two men who wish to succeed me on Tuesday. You know also so many others _ tens of thousands of candidates on state and local and school board ballots from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and there are ballot propositions on issues from gun control to the size of cow stalls. And yes, every one of these choices is vital. Every one is crucial. Every one gives you an opportunity to say, `` This is what I want the future to look like. This is the country that I want to live in.'' And I believe you must take every choice from county sheriff to president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with equal seriousness. That's because our system depends upon you _ every single one of you. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, one of our founding fathers, said it best. `` No laws have any validity or binding force without the consent and approbation of the people.'' Well, what we've learned in the course of human history is that dictators may coerce and tyrants may control, but the people who obey them do so only because there are threatened with bodily harm to themselves or their families if they do not. These societies are not just and they're not good. And perhaps most telling, they do not work. They do not work because the people have no voice; they have no say. Their elections are cynical frauds, sick jokes. Did you know that in the most recent election in the Stalinist nation of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, the vote tally was 1,820,652 to one. Yes, without the fundamental freedom of the right to choose, hope disintegrates, expectations for the future suffer, and life itself becomes gray and dreary. And, that means a weak economy, low standards of living, high infant mortality, and general gloom. Now, compare that kind of society with the Democratic societies, where the last two centuries have seen the expansion of opportunity and freedom, steady increases in standards of living, and a constant belief that things will get only better. And why? Because we who live in democracy are all our own masters, and we know that the future is ours to build. And that the only limits upon us, are those we place on ourselves. You can imagine how very moved I was last May to be in the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, at a podium before an audience of students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, speaking to them about the wonder and glory of human freedom. Individual freedom. Think of those students, only if they're very lucky and rise high in the communist party, will any one of them ever have the influence on the course of their country's history, and world history, that each of you can have just by going into the voting booth So, my fellow Americans, on Tuesday, breathe in the intoxicating air of human freedom in every polling place and voting booth in the nation, and reaffirm the words in the Declaration of Independence, `` All men are created equal.'' Thank you, and until next week, God Bless You and God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Texas Judge Reprimanded For Threatening Lawyers, Calling People
`Trash'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge allowed her child to run around her courtroom during proceedings, called litigants and others `` pure trash,'' and threatened to shoot a lawyer, says a state panel that publicly reprimanded her. The reprimand issued Friday against District Judge <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is the most severe action the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> can take short of removing a judge from the bench, officials said. The commission's findings said Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> had, among other things, called people in her courtroom `` pure trash,'' left the bench crying and shouting threats at attorneys, and told one lawyer that she had a gun and could shoot two holes in his back before he could leave the courtroom. `` The comments of Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> are not consistent with the temperament required of a member of the judiciary,'' said the commission's report, adding tha she `` brought discredit to the judiciary.'' Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was elected to the district court in 1984, and her term expires Dec. 31. However, the commission said, `` it is not to the benefit of the judiciary or the public to allow improper conduct to go unsanctioned solely because of an approaching expiration of a term.'' Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was elected as a Republican in 1984 but ran in this year's Democratic primary for a seat on the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. She was defeated in March. According to the commission's report, signed by executive director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> failed to respond to the charges `` through personal interview, telephone communication and hand-delivered written interrogatories.'' The commission's report said the disciplinary panel concluded that Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s cumulative actions constituted `` willful or persistent conduct that -LRB- was -RRB- clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of her duties.'' Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. She was n't in her office Friday and a secretary said Saturday that the judge was not expected until Monday. Her home number was not listed. As listed in the report, the commission's findings also included: _ During a court proceeding, the judge failed to control the actions of her 9-year-old son, who distracted lawyers, jurors and herself `` by running around and crawling behind the judge's bench. _ Ms <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> told her son, in the presence of litigants and others in the courtroom: `` Son, you see these people out here, they're trash, they're pure trash, all of'em.'' _ In one proceeding, she held a lawyer in contempt and told him `` to pay a fine to her favorite charity, i.e., a personal friend in the hospital. On Jan. 13, a jury acquitted Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of charges of threatening a <LOCATION> Kingwood </LOCATION> woman and her son in a dispute over a child's broken toy Several bar associations have rated her the worst judge in <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> is the judge whose temporary injunction propelled the state's controversial `` no pass, no play'' statute regarding high school athletics to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled the law constitutional.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Natural Toxin May Be Culprit In Dolphin Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A naturally occurring toxin is the focus of research into an epidemic of dolphin deaths along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the lead investigator said Saturday. More than 800 dead and dying bottlenose dolphins, many with skin lesions, washed ashore from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> southward to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> beginning in June 1987. The last dead dolphin was spotted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February. Researchers originally suspected a virus or bacteria, but are now concentrating on toxins that could have poisoned the marine mammals, said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON>, professor of wildlife diseases at the <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guelph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He presented a report on his investigation at an Oceans'88 conference here. He expects final conclusions in about six weeks. <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said that while high levels of pollutants and various viruses were found in the dead dolphins' tissue, neither appears to have killed them. `` -LRB- We -RRB- suspect that we are dealing with a point source, something at sea that might have been a natural toxin or some other pollutant,'' <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said. He said all the dolphins appear to have been poisoned in early summer 1987. `` Some died right away, some lived long enough to become infected with bacterias. Those animals languished for as long as six, eight months after the initial event,'' he said. Most industrial pollutants have been tentatively ruled out and scientists are concentrating on natural poisons, <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said. One battery of tests for biological toxins found nothing but tests are continuing, he said. The events that led to a rare red tide along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, although not the red tide itself, may be to blame, the Canadian scientist said. Red tides occur when microscopic algae become so populous that the water appears stained red. In great concentrations they release toxins that are deadly to some fish. And once in the food chain, the toxins can harm other creatures, including man. While common on the west coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, red tides are almost unheard of on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, although in 1987 a red tide spread as far as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, killing shellfish there, <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said. `` However, that event occurred in the first part of November, whereas the dolphins were dying as early as June,'' he said. `` There may have been events that spawned this red tide on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> that were also associated with the mortality of the dolphins,'' <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said. He declined to elaborate, saying that could compromise the objectivity of the investigation. Warm water, calm seas, high nutrient levels, low salinity and rainy periods followed by sunny weather are some of the factors that contribute to red tides. `` The pattern of mortality, the extended time when it took place, the geographic range: all lead us to suspect that we are dealing with an agent or condition which these animals might have contacted at about the same time in early summer of'87,'' <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said.

 Tens of thousands of screaming protesters clashed with police throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Saturday, demanding the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> on corruption charges. Riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> fired tear gas to block a 10,000-strong crowd from marching to the former president's house. The protesters brandished rocks and threw firebombs. At least 11 officers were injured, authorities said, including 10 hurt when a police station in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> was pelted with rocks and firebombed. Dozens of protesters were seen injured and carried away, but police gave no figures for the total number of injuries and arrests. Tear gas filled the streets of seven other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> cities _ Wonju, <LOCATION> Chunchon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> _ as police fought students at anti-Chun rallies, authorities reported. The scandal over corruption allegedly committed by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family has become the major political issue in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. On Saturday, three opposition groups rejected a governing party offer for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> to make a public apology for his alleged misdeeds in office. Students in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> burned effigies of <LOCATION> Chun </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, and thousands of citizens cheered and shouted `` Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected in December to replace <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who held office seven years. The election followed months of anti-government demonstrations. In <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, an opposition stronghold south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters trying to burn an effigy of the former president after a street march, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Police also battled groups of slogan-chanting protesters in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, after students razed two police buses, shattered dozens of windows and damaged eight cars in a firebomb attack on a government prosecutors' building. One student was injured when he fell out of a third-floor window. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police martial arts squads drove protesters into side streets, beating and kicking them, but the protest swelled with thousands of other citizens demanding <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s arrest. Thousands of riot police using armored vehicles fired volleys of tear gas at more than 15,000 protesters at one crowded shopping area. At least 10 police officers were hurt when students hurled rocks and scores of firebombs into a police station in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. A police officer was injured on the southern outskirts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when students attacked an office of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with firebombs. During the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> rally Saturday, dissident leaders called for bigger rallies next week and vowed to attack <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s house. Radical students have launched attacks on government buildings and party offices since Thursday, when riot police blocked a march to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s home by thousands of students. The governing party, in a move aimed at ending the protests, proposed Saturday that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> apologize or respond to allegations of corruption and misrule, but opposition leaders rejected the offer and demanded an investigation. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was recently sentenced to seven years' in prison for taking bribes and misusing millions of dollars in government money while he headed a rural development program. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who took power with military backing in 1980, also is being investigated for his alleged role in putting down a 1980 civil uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. By official count, about 200 people died in the military suppression of the nine-day uprising. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former military general and a friend of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Saturday to begin a four-day visit and did not comment on the disturbances.

It's my job to deliver the official response of my party to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and that's a difficult assignment. Even though he's been out campaigning for our opponents, I think every American wishes President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> well as he nears the end of his presidency. And even though President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is trying to lend <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a helping hand, I'll bet he's been disappointed in the behavior of those who now carry the Republican banner. A presidential campaign should be a magic moment for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A time when we're proud of ourselves as a democracy because we're proud of our candidates There has n't been much about the campaign of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that would make any American proud. They spent millions of dollars, your tax dollars, to raise false fears and make you believe this election is about phony issues. They hired the best political hit men Republican money can buy and they set out to assassinate the character of Governor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, my running mate. I think democracy is too fragile, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> too special for us to reward that kind of negative campaigning. We ca n't elect a candidate who is trying to divide <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into its lowest common denominator. The Republicans want you to believe this election is about right and left. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I say it's about right and wrong and who's really on your side We say it's wrong for the Republicans to duck the issues and distort the truth. We say the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> solves problems, creates opportunity and fights hard for working men and women who have suffered from eight years of Republican indifference. When it comes to issues of concern to the middle-income folks in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we're right and the Republicans are wrong. We're on your side and they are not. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I are right when we say a college education should be a right and not a privilege for every qualified high school graduate. We have a college loan program to make that dream a reality. We're on your side when we say <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs a government that will stand up and fight hard for American jobs and American products. We're right when we say countries enjoying full access to our markets must give us full access to their markets. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I are on your side when we pledge never to cut your Social Security benefits and to protect programs like <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. We are right when we say trade and budget deficits just have to be reduced. We are on your side when we offer programs to help young couples save for that first home. We're right when we tell you how we'll provide health insurance for 37 million Americans who lack coverage and live in terror of illness and financial ruin. We are right when we demand justice in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and when we demand competence, not contempt for government service. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are wrong, dead wrong when they turn their backs on issues of concern to middle-income <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and tell you that this country can toast into the future with the status quo. If we permit this election to be decided by the mudslingers and the truth-twisters, we'll do a grave disservice to our democracy. We'll set a dangerous precedent and put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on notice that when it comes to choosing a president, anything goes and the truth really does n't matter When you walk into that voting booth on Tuesday, stop for a moment. Consider the issues that really matter to you: education, health care, good jobs at good wages, making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> number one in the world. Ask yourself if <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is really qualified to be president. Ask yourself if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can do better. And if your answer is yes, vote for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> because we're on your side. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come and I believe that.

 A law that would boost the power of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox religious establishment but alienate many American Jews has a good chance of passage in the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Saturday Also Saturday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said his left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> might join a coalition with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc if <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> fails to form a government with religious parties `` A rightist-religious coalition will bring terrible things to this country,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV. `` In view of our national responsibility, I do n't rule out ... a broad-based government under certain conditions that would enable us to attain our goals in the areas of diplomacy and security.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said they would not accept <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> as a coalition partner s long as <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> insists on an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. Both <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have negotiatiated separately with Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties about possibly forming a governing coalition in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. The so-called `` Who Is A Jew'' law is a key demand by the religious parties. It would give Orthodox rabbis sole authority to validate conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. It has been denounced as discriminatory by American Jews, most of whom are affiliated with the Reform and Conservative movements of Judaism. `` ` Before every vote on some religious law, there is a big noise among American Jews,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` I'm convinced we'll reach some understanding with the American Jews.'' In Tuesday's election, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member chamber but needs the mandates of the religious parties and three extreme right-wing parties to form a majority. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 39 seats, has held coalition talks with the religious parties, but its chances of forming a government with them are considered slim. Most Likud legislators, including <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, backed the `` Who Is A Jew'' proposal when it was put to a vote last year and narrowly defeated. `` If there are now more parliament members who agree to this -LRB- law -RRB-, there are more chances that it will pass,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in the radio interview. Existing law defines Jews as those born to a Jewish mother or converted to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. It recognizes conversions by all three branches of Judaism, but Orthodox rabbis argue that only their conversions are valid. They want the law to be changed to read `` converted to Judaism according to Orthodox law.'' `` Should we have non-Jews among us registered as Jews, which is of course a lie?'' <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaki </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. The proposed law would not affect most Conservative or Reform Jews, but members of the two movements have said it would symbolically expel them from the Jewish fold. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is ready to give -LRB- the religious parties -RRB- as much as they want,'' said <PERSON> Shulamit </PERSON> <PERSON> Aloni </PERSON>, head of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` They can change our lives, lock us in at home on Saturdays and holidays.'' But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> dismissed fears by secular Israelis that the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would make too many concessions to the religious parties, which also demand a ban on driving, movies and soccer on the <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>. `` I do n't foresee any decisive chances,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` Everyone will be able to continue to live as he does now.'' Secular Israelis make up about two-thirds of the population.

<HEAD>Woman Can Sue Hospital For ``Outrageous Conduct''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has cleared the way for trial on a lawsuit filed by a woman who had to deliver her own stillborn fetus and seeks damages from a hospital for `` outrageous conduct.'' <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> says she delivered the child into a bedpan on March 11, 1985, at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> with the assistance of only a roommate. She alleged that for 15 to 20 minutes she and the roommate had been unable to get hospital personnel to assist them and that the nursing staff had intentionally de-activated her intercom buzzer after she used it several times to complain of pain. When a nurse finally arrived at the room after the birth, Ms. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> and the roommate contend, the nurse yelled at Ms. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, who was hysterical, to `` shut up, as she was disturbing other patients,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said in its opinion Friday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Monohan </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the nurse used `` harsh words,'' but said she did so only to calm the patient in order to determine what had happened and later apologized. <PERSON> Monohan </PERSON> said there was `` absolutely no evidence'' that the buzzer had been disconnected, and said nurses responded in `` 15 to 20 seconds'' after they heard Ms. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>'s screams. Ms. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, who had two previous miscarriages and had a high-risk pregnancy, does n't contend that <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for her baby's death. `` Our complaint is with how she was treated,'' said her lawyer, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sales </PERSON>. <PERSON> Monohan </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> was in a regular patient room, rather than the hospital's obstetrical section, on the advice of her doctor. `` Unexpected premature expulsions of the fetus can happen without the ability of anyone to predict it,'' <PERSON> Monohan </PERSON> said. `` No one did a thing wrong.'' Writing for the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, Judge <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> took no position on the truth of Ms. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>'s claims, but said she had presented enough evidence to meet the threshold for trying to prove `` outrageous conduct.'' Under <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law plaintiffs may recover damages for conduct `` outrageous in the extreme'' even if they have n't been physically injured. The Court of Appeals said plaintiffs must show they suffered severe emotional distress, rather than mere `` bad manners or hurt feelings.'' They also must prove the wrongdoer's conduct so `` intolerable it offends against generally accepted standards of decency and morality.'' The opinion reversed a <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling.

<TEXT>
 At times, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> seemed more like a politician on the campaign trail than a prime minister on an official visit when citizens of this Communist state flocked to see the British leader. During last week's three-day visit, Polish workers battling for a free trade union welcomed as a hero the staunchly anti-Communist leader who has battered <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> labor unions and axed thousands of jobs to cut losses in coal mines, shipyards and steel mills. The Communist government also gave her red carpet treatment. But <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accused Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of turning the visit `` into a hypocritical ego trip.'' `` In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> she has held a dialogue with trade unionists, oozing syrupy pseudo-sympathy. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> she tramples on trade unionists and never has any dialogue with them,'' he said Saturday. `` In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> she associates with men fighting to keep a shipyard open. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> she shuts most of our shipyards down,'' he said. Her visit began two days after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders announced they will shut down <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>'s money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> Dec. 1. She distanced herself from Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s admiring references to her own tough line with labor unions and closures of money-losing enterprises `` The situation was completely different. We were elected to stop abuses of power by trade union leaders in a democracy,'' aides quoted her as telling <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> got a rousing welcome from about 20,000 people Friday in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> when she became the first Western head of state to meet <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in the heartland of his banned Solidarity labor movement. Solidarity loved her for telling Gen. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> at a banquet that he must negotiate with the union and other opposition groups as the price for long-term financial aid from the West. He responded coolly. Their joint public engagements had an air of formal correctness. But the commemorations at monuments to those who died in World War II _ the sober-faced <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> in military uniform and the prime minister in a black coat and hat _ were more than rituals. Both leaders recalled that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1939 triggered World War II with the British declaration of war on <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and praised the gallantry of Poles who fought in the British armed services. She stopped business during a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> market trip that was reminiscent of an election-time visit. In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, she looked near tears at a service in the shipyard's Roman Catholic parish church, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>, as the congregation joined in a Polish national hymn, their arms raised in the Solidarity victory sign Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> dodged reporters' questions about her views of the shipyard closure, but she told <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>: `` It is apparent that no one can stop you.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> added an informal touch which aides said delighted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. He unexpectedly came to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to see her off Friday night and sent two bouquets of flowers to her plane.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Department Defends Use Of Padded Jail Cells</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge says the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail insulted human decency by housing naked inmates in unsanitary padded cells, but the sheriff's department says the dozen padded cells are necessary and used properly. `` Our philosophy is to treat inmates with dignity,'' Assistant Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said Friday at a news conference. `` The cells are always clean and they are properly used. We provide the finest care we can for them.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has ordered that inmates put into the cells be given bedding, cloth gowns, toilet paper and access to washing facilities. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> issued the order Wednesday in a lawsuit filed Oct. 8 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He said housing naked inmates in unsanitary conditions was an insult to human decency. The lawsuit claimed the padded cells were unfit to live in and were used to improperly punish inmates. `` They are the best alternative for the unfortunates who are suffering mental disturbances that are dangerous to themselves or other people,'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said. The judge's order reaffirmed existing policies for the cells, said Dr. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, director of the psychiatric unit. He said inmates put in the cells receive medical evaluations and approval is sought from a psychiatrist. `` We have no quarrel with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s order,'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said. `` More clothing and amenities are something we can comply with. But I think it's sometimes safer not to give the individual something they could strangle themselves with.'' A different picture was described by a doctor who worked in the jail from April 1987 to August 1988. `` Every time I walked into one of those cells there was vomit, urine and filth on the floor,'' Dr. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez-Pabon </PERSON> said. He testified that the cells were `` something out of a detention-camp movie.''

<HEAD>Democrats: Issueless Presidential Campaign Leaves Mandate To
Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 6-7 with 2 grafs to supply first names for Bush and
Dukakis.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats are so confident they'll do well in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races that they are throwing down the gauntlet for the next president already, saying they _ not the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ will have the mandate to chart <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s course for the next four years. Behind that confidence is the likelihood of Democratic advances in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and perhaps the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, plus the perception that the presidential candidates have done little to define a clear vision of what should happen after Election Day. In the current arithmetic, it appears likely Democrats will pad their 54-46 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> advantage by one or two seats. House Democrats will remain dominant as well, perhaps adding a small handful of seats to their current 255-177 majority. But both sides also are prepared for surprises. `` I've never seen the electorate as volatile as it is right now,'' says Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Presidential mandates are created when a president makes a persuasive case, based on a clear Election Day tide, that his victory amounts to a popular directive to pursue certain policies. `` There's not a prayer of a chance that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will accept any definition of a -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mandate,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. A more solidly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is also likely to deny <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, if he wins, the traditional honeymoon period of cooperation. A victory for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would bring less friction, but eking out a come-from-behind win is not the stuff of which mandates are made. `` Whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins or not, there is a very clear commitment to continue what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> started two years ago _ addressing trade, health care ... issues that have been ignored,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. Instead of resembling 1980, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was swept into office along with a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the next two years are more likely to look like the last two, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a lame duck and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> largely set the national agenda, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. `` The way to think about this is not as the president leading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but of the two as truly equal partners, seeking accommodation and negotiation'' he said. `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adopts that mode and demonstrates some flexibility, then he can get some things done.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, made it clear on the campaign trail last week that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, if elected, will be unable to expect much deference from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` I do n't see how a president has any kind of mandate if he wins by negative advertising,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is virtually certain to be re-elected to his <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat regardless of what happens in the presidential race. Polls, too, are showing that voters are unhappy with the choices for president and want to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to have a strong balancing role. A Wall Street Journal @ <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> poll published Oct. 28 showed that by a 22-point margin, voters prefer to have the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> controlled by different political parties. In both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-incumbent bias helps Democrats. Fifteen Democratic senators are seeking re-election, and all but two _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ are considered relatively safe. A dozen <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators are facing the voters. One, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, trails badly in the polls. Two others, <PERSON> Chic </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, are locked in dead-heat struggles to hold on. There are six `` open'' seats, where no incumbent is seeking re-election; each party currently controls three. One <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> seat, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, is regarded as certain to switch to the Democratic column for former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> is expected to hold the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republican </LOCATION> seat for his party. The Democrats appear likely to lose one of their open seats, in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, to GOP Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, and to hold onto another, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where millionaire businessman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has bought enough television time to make himself well known. Two open seats, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democratic slot and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state Republican one, remain toss-ups and will be the most closely watched contests on election night. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said a late surge by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was helping Democrats, particularly by generating enthusiasm that would help motivate voters to the polls. The get-out-the vote boost would be especially helpful among black voters, many of whom have harbored resentment toward the party over what they regard as ill treatment of their favorite candidate, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Republicans, meanwhile, were hoping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead in states like <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> would help their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was airing a TV spot in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorses him. `` We're more enthusiastic about our chances than we have been at any time in the cycle,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. While he conceded the possibility the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> might lose a couple of seats, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> added: `` We could just as easily be plus two or better.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, incumbency remained the most potent force at work in campaigns. It appeared likely that as in past years, nine out of 10 sitting lawmakers will be returned to office. Of 27 open seats which were the most open to party turnover, Republicans hold 15 and Democrats hold 12, giving Democrats the mathematical edge for possible pickups. Another 70 incumbent races considered reasonably close are split about evenly between the two parties.

 In this usually placid nation of palm-fringed tropical islands, people are trying to come to grips with a violent intrusion that left scores dead. `` I never thought I would see a man in combat in my life,'' <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>, a 29-year-old diving instructor, said Saturday. `` I heard gunshots for the first time,'' said <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, who works in his father's cafe on <PERSON> Male </PERSON>'s main street. `` I did n't know what had happened.'' Two days after gunmen tried to overthrow the government, bloodstains still marked the ground outside the presidential palace and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> building, headquarters of the 1,200-man force that is the country's only defense organization. While rain drizzled down, members of the force patrolled <PERSON> Male </PERSON>'s gray sand streets in jeeps and on motorcycles Outside the capital city of one - and two-story white brick homes, Indian paratroopers could be seen But the tuna trawlers that had stayed out of sight since the failed coup again docked at Male's jetty. By evening, people thronged <PERSON> Male </PERSON>'s streets to buy freshly caught fish from the trawlers. They carried the big fish home in their arms and on the handlebars of their bicycles, the main mode of land transportation. `` The <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> are normally a very peaceful, quiet place. We are all as brothers,'' said businessman Redeem <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Didi </PERSON>. The economy of the overwhelmingly Moslem nation depends largely on fishing and tourism. Special islands have been set aside for tourists, where they drink the alcoholic beverages forbidden to the 182,000 Maldivians under Islamic law. Tourists seemed largely untouched by Thursday's attempt to overthrow President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> and by the news that about 30 people died. The gunmen fled after Indian paratroopers arrived. `` We came to know about the coup only 12 hours after the mercenaries landed,'' said <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Granlof </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sundstahl </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Granlof </PERSON>, a radio journalist, and his wife were staying at the <LOCATION> Kurumba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resort </LOCATION> on an island five miles from the Male atoll. `` The tourists did what they came to do,'' said <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> Murad </PERSON>, an Indian on a business trip. `` We are cut off and life here was totally normal.'' Some tourists were upset because their departures were delayed when the attack prompted officials to close the airport to commercial traffic. `` I have stayed three days extra here with my family,'' said <PERSON> Satya </PERSON> <PERSON> Prakesh </PERSON>, who wanted to return to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> where he works for <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am paying 500 rupees -LRB- $ 34 -RRB- a day room rent.'' That was relatively cheap, though. Many of the beach resorts cost between $ 100 and $ 200 a night.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' `` on-your-side'' campaign pitch Saturday, saying the Democratic ca n't admit that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been been `` fighting for the people all along.'' `` Now I would ask you, who's on the side of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people? <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a crowd gathered in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state capitol building. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the No. 2 man on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration created jobs and cut tax rates while bringing about a post-recession economic recovery that has stretched into its 71st month. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saved <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from decline,'' he told the crowd, many yelling and waving miniature flags.

But he added, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not jittery. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not jittery.'' `` There'll be three, long hard days until the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people tell us who the next president of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be,'' he told some 250 gathered in an ornate, columned hall fronting the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber in the capitol building. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was accompanied on Saturday's trip by his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and his three children, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 14, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, celebrating his 12th birthday, and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, 9. He toured a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Timonium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, later, made some phone calls to undecided voters and mixed with people at the Valley View Farms nearby. `` Attention shoppers: <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has arrived and will be here soon,'' a voice barked over a public address system at the outdoor shopping mart. During the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> event, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was heckled at various intervals by a small band of pro-Dukakis supporters. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the rally that he had had `` a lot of fun'' talking about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' resume, a young man shouted, `` What about your resume?'' Scoffing at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' populist campaign pitch to voters that he's `` on your side'' and the Republicans are `` on their side,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> rattled off a host of government economic statistics that he said showed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> on the side of average people He cited the latest civilian unemployment report, released Friday, which fell to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1974. `` We're on their side and we've been fighting for the people all along,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> defended his relatively light weekend schedule of campaign appearances, telling reporters that `` it would n't make any difference if I had two or 16 events. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to focus on the top of the ticket these last ... days and see which person they want to have as the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Former Security Chief Named New Algerian Premier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> on Saturday appointed a former military chief to be the new premier after Algerians approved reforms giving the premier greater power in governing the nation. <PERSON> Kasdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> replaces <PERSON> Abdelhamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahimi </PERSON> as premier, according to a statement from the president's office. <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> will appoint a new government. In a referendum Thursday, Algerians overwhelmingly approved changes to the constitution aimed at reducing the power of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the sole legal party in this North African nation of 25 million. The referendum grants the premier greater powers _ which are now wielded mostly by the president through a Soviet-style central control _ and makes him responsible to the National Assembly, or parliament. Last month, Algerians took to the streets to protest their declining standard of living, food shortages and lack of jobs. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and provincial towns became violent, troops moved in and 176 people died in six days, according to official count. The rioting ended when <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> promised political and economic reforms, including the referendum and a government shake-up. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> -RRB- is known as a can-do guy,'' said one Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` -LRB- He -RRB- is objective-oriented and reform-minded. He may be just the guy to oversee the changes Bendjedid is planning.'' <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON>, who has kept a low profile in the state-controlled press, has a reputation among Algerians for integrity and honesty. The 50-year-old premier fought in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s war of liberation against the French colonizers in the 1950s. After Algerian independence in 1962, <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> was made an army colonel and was appointed director of national defense. He was among the officers who led the June 19, 1965, coup that ousted President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>. The new president, <PERSON> Houari </PERSON> <PERSON> Boumedienne </PERSON>, made <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> chief of military security, the country's most powerful police force. <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> was credited with tipping the balance among the military officers who brought Bendjedid to power in 1979 after <PERSON> Boumedienne </PERSON>'s death Bendjedid named <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> secretary-general of defense and, in 1980, vice-minister of defense. Since 1984, <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> held a series of offices, including minister of industry, minister of agriculture and minister of health. As agriculture minister, <PERSON> Mesbah </PERSON> oversaw the conversion of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s enormous state farms to small, private collectives _ one of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s more successful attempts at making the economy more efficient and productive. The new government faces an economic crisis brought on by the plummeting prices of petroleum products, which represent 97 percent of the country's export earnings. Sources close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Benjedid is planning a modified form of privatization for some industries and also hopes to find ways of diversifying the economy.

 A `` virus'' that clogged computers across the country probably was created without malice or intent to cause damage, school officials and associates of the student suspected of creating it said Saturday. If <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 23, was the source of the virus last week, he had enough computer savvy that he could have caused catastrophic damage to the network the virus invaded, fellow students said. `` He's very clever, very intelligent,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> computer student <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraff </PERSON>, who said he has known <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> since they both worked a summer at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even in high school he was already good at this stuff.'' `` If he had wanted it -LRB- the virus -RRB- to be malicious, it would have been really malicious,'' <PERSON> Baraff </PERSON> said. While the virus program kept computers extremely busy and jammed their memories by ordering the machines to replicate itself, it destroyed no data, officials at effected centers said. It eventually affected about 6,000 computers at military and civilian research centers. Other than his reputation as an accomplished hacker, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has been virtually nameless and faceless in the two months since he entered <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s doctorate computer science program, students said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources as identifying <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> as the creator of the virus. `` He was quiet and always working on things,'' said student <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Asplen </PERSON>. `` Maybe this is what he was working on.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a first-year student in the graduate computer science program, `` would just be programming all the time, though I do n't really know what he was working on,'' said student <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who said he worked at a terminal near <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' in one of their classes Other students in the same class said they could not even remember what <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> looks like. `` I would n't even be able to tell you who he is,'' student <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Given the nature of computer science, where work is generally done alone at a terminal, it's not unusual for students to remain aloof, students said. The skills to break into Arpanet, the Defense Department-supported network into which <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> allegedly unleashed the virus from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s computer system, also are not unusual, students said. `` I would presume we would all be considered quite good hackers,'' graduate student <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stodghill </PERSON> said. He shares an office with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> but said he rarely has seen him there. But <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was a little better at hacking _ unauthorized manipulation of computers _ than others, associates said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was highly recommended to <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> by his undergraduate professors at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but more for his practical computer skills than his academic record, according to his adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> instructor <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON>. If the virus is traced to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, `` appropriate disciplinary action'' will be taken, said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for information technologies. He would not give details on what actions might be taken. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krafft </PERSON>, research associate in computer science at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>, said it will be hard to prove whether <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was responsible, because `` it's not a question of having eyewitnesses ... it's not like we have any fingerprints'' left behind from programs used to create the virus.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Saturday the latest round of Iran-Iraq peace talks has produced a `` reaffirmation of the commitment'' by both countries to the 2 -LCB- - month-old cease-fire <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> made his remarks following a face-to-face meeting between the Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> foreign ministers. It was the third such session since the talks resumed Monday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> then left for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and is to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sunday.

Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters that the question of troop withdrawals was one of the problems.

 Here are excerpts from a speech by Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>: `` I smell victory in the air. ... I do n't have to tell you what's happening out there You can feel it and sense it and taste it. ... `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> started celebrating a little early, do n't you? I've got a message for them: We're the ones who are going to be celebrating on the Eighth of November. As a matter of fact, yesterday <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, ` We're going to work hard right through Nov. 4.' I can understand why he wants the election to be over. We're going to be working hard until the polls close on the Eighth of November. I think he's slipping, and we're surging.

 Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, gloating that Republicans are `` dropping like a rock in the polls,'' rallied volunteers Saturday in delegate-rich <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and told radio listeners the election should n't be decided by `` mudslingers and the truth twisters.'' `` The Republicans are panicking because the truth is catching up with them,'' said the Democratic vice presidential nominee, blasting what he contends are false advertisments by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. The Republican philosophy was, `` If it sounds good, we're going to say it, and never mind the facts,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, speaking at a rally of about 250 Democratic precinct workers and other supporters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said it was now up to them to get out the word and win <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the election for him and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` My friends, this is the big one _ 47 electoral votes,'' he said. `` We win it in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, we win it across this nation.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was joined at the rally by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Rep. <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, D-Calif., and was introduced by actress <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> `` I'll tell you, the Republicans are dropping like a rock in the polls,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, repeating his assertion that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would _ like <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> _ confound the experts and win. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll released Friday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by seven points among probable voters, down from the 12-point lead in a survey taken earlier in the week. `` I see some of those Republicans popping their champagne corks,'' he said. `` On Nov. 9, they're going to have one of the worst hangovers they've ever had.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wrapped up a one-day swing through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with a speech later Saturday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to a union audience emphasizing the Democrats' class-conscious theme that they were `` on your side.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, delivering the Democrats' response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, blasted the Republicans for negative campaigning and said, `` Even though President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is trying to lend <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a helping hand, I'll bet he's been disappointed in the behavior of those who now carry the Republican banner.'' `` They have spent millions of dollars _ your tax dollars _ to raise false fears and make you believe this election is about phony issues,'' he said. `` They hired the best political hit men Republican money can buy.'' `` If we permit this election to be decided by the mudslingers and the truth twisters ... we will set a dangerous precedent and put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on notice that when it comes to choosing a president, anything goes and the truth really does n't matter,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also was scheduled to appear on two television interview shows on Sunday, part of the Democrats' aggressive media strategy in the waning days of the campaign. Late last month, the campaign aired a five-minute spot on network television featuring <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, unprecedented for the No. 2 person on the ticket. At the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> rally, the bilingual <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> mixed a little Spanish in with his English. And he also threw in a Yiddish expression _ chutzpah, which roughly translates to `` gall'' _ to describe one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claims against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But he botched the pronunciation of the word. Afterward, aides asserted, jokingly, that it was a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> dialect. Later in the day, in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> union hall near Fisherman's Wharf, more than 500 Democratic campaign workers staged a boisterous rally for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` We're on the side of working ment and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> declared, citing the Democratic plans for new health care, education and housing programs. Again attacking the Republican ads, he said, `` We're not going to put up with it, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are n't going to put up with it,'' he said. `` We're armed with the truth, and we're going to set the record straight,'' he said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON>, the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign director in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said 80 get-out-the-vote rallies were being held in the state this weekend.

<HEAD>How Computer Viruses Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A computer virus is a tiny program introduced to computers either as a prank or vandalism. Just as a biological virus disrupts living cells to cause disease, a computer virus invades data processors and disrupts normal operation of the machines. A virus duplicates itself, spreading into other programs in the computer and infecting one computer after another as users share floppy disks or link up over telephone lines. Mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative message on a user's screen; `` deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a computer. Some are `` time bombs'' designed to wreak havoc on a pre-programmed date. The virus that infected 6,000 university and military computers nationwide last week apparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.

 Economic Manager Says Reform Showing Results, More Needed
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Politburo member, addressing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders Saturday, said economic reforms are showing results but must be followed by improvements in food and consumer goods. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> spoke at the traditional Kremlin gathering marking the anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. During the meeting President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talked and joked with <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo and considered to be a conservative rival of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who had been considered the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hierarchy, was downgraded and given the agriculture portfolio in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s shake-up at the end of September. Two Politburo members, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, were absent. There was no explanation for <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON>'s absence, but it was believed <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> was presiding over anniversary ceremonies in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> is the former party chief in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, which has been held up as an example of economic reform. `` Today, like never before, we need strict discipline, but not the discipline of the fist but the discipline of interested, conscious democracy,'' he said. The call to social action is `` not fear, but interest, economic stimulus,'' <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> said. He told the gathering of hundreds of party and government leaders along with scientists and military officers that the national income is rising because of an increase in labor productivity. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still must supply its citizens with more consumer goods and food, he said, and part of the solution is the lease system of farming that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is promoting to give farmers a greater interest in their work. <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> expressed the party's support for greater openness in public discussion, if it does not question the party's power. Without offering specifics, <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> said the party also recognized the need to work out new relations between members of the country's more than 100 nationalities. Ethnic tensions have been especially strong in the southern republics of Armenian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and in the Baltic republics of the northeast.

A handful of major steel firms had been lobbying the vice president for a commitment on the quotas, and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would lose the state and its 25 electoral votes unless he promised to extend the trade pacts, which expire next September <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> released a letter to <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> Saturday saying that one of his key trade policy goals as president would be to achieve `` international consensus'' on eliminating unfair steel trade practices. `` Pending that, I can assure you of my intention to continue the voluntary restraint program after Sept. 30, 1989,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the letter. `` As vice president, I worked to prevent the sacrifice of our industry to those who choose not to subject themselves to the discipline of the market, and I have no intention of abandoning that commitment if I am elected president.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON> said the Democrat `` has been in support of extending the steel agreements for the entire campaign.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to come out in favor of it,'' <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON> said. `` This is the most cynical and cowardly action one can imagine. He -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- had the entire campaign to come out for the steel idustry.'' Pressured by the industry and by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year steel trade agreements with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other leading steel-exporting nations in September 1984. The idea was to give American companies breathing space from subsidized foreign competition by pressuring competitors to restrict imports on a product-by-product basis. With the steel industry turning a profit last year and with some importers complaining of steel product shortages, it has been hotly debated whether the import curbs should be extended. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter demonstrated the vice president's commitment to the nation's manufacturing base and provided `` proof, I believe, that we will carry <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and other industrial states where the contest is too close to call.

 Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Saturday the government must suspend its decision to close the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard before he will meet the interior minister to discuss convening talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. `` In this situation, our meeting depends exclusively on the authorities. In spite of numerous disappointments, I trust that this time we manage to come to agreement,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a communique. There was no immediate response from the government, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement appeared to leave the two sides no closer to convening the government-opposition talks originally planned for mid-October Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said Friday that the government's decision to close the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Dec. 1 was `` irreversible.'' The Solidarity trade union was formed at the shipyard in 1980 and became the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc when it was chartered by the government. But it was suspended in December in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. Saturday's developments followed more than three weeks of verbal sparring between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the government over when the talks can begin. The talks had stalled over whether <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would drop two advisers from Solidarity's proposed delegation who the government considers extremists. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said he would not allow officials to interfere in the composition of Solidarity's delegation. He also said he would not agree to a preliminary meeting with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> if the meeting would include personnel matters. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> on Wednesday renewed the offer of a preliminary meeting in a letter sent to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Saturday he would meet with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> if the government suspended the shipyard decision and honored a previous promise to rehire workers dismissed for striking during a wave of labor unrest in August. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> delayed a formal reply to <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> until after the departure Friday of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The government on Monday announced its plan to close the Lenin shipyard and said the action was taken because of the economic need to shut down money-losing, state-subsidied industrial plants. But Solidarity said the decision by the new prime minister, longtime Solidarity foe <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, was political. Talks among representatives of the opposition, authorities and other social groups were first proposed by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> during the strikes in August.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ More women working outside the home have allowed most American families to keep the buying power they had 10 years ago, according to a study released Saturday. Forty percent of families, however, have not keep pace with the increasing cost of living over the past decade, said the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The head of the liberal think tank said the report shows average <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families have been under greater economic pressure during the past decade than at any time since World War II. `` Without new economic policies it is clear that families can no longer count on steadily increasing incomes and that the next generations can not expect to live better than their parents,'' said institute President <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Faux </PERSON>, an economist. The institute, established in 1986 by prominent liberal economists, describes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit group. It has opposed the conservative economic policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The report said salaries for most women have increased faster than inflation, while salaries for all but the richest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men have n't kept up. The study documents a growing gap between rich and poor in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and says that young adults who do not finish college are doing `` substantially worse'' than those who were the same age a decade ago. It also says low wages are forcing growing numbers of unattached young people _ 1.5 million more than a decade ago _ to `` return to the nest'' of their parents' households rather than living on their own. Economists <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasenfest </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, who wrote the report, said they used statistical methods that take into account family size. They also used the most conservative cost-of-living figures to overcome objections to previous studies that also showed widening inequality and slow income growth. Some conservative economists have argued that Americans are doing better because families are smaller even if family incomes have not kept up with inflation. `` This is an important first step in measuring the real economic benefit of having a wife work,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said figures cited by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and others seem to show improved economic conditions while polls show that people think they are worse off. Income from a working wife, he said, may add to family income but may cost more in child care, restaurant and other expenses. `` More wives are working now because they feel they have to, because they have to have a certain relative standard of living,'' he said. The report says the number of working wives increased from 55.4 percent in 1979 to 66.1 percent in 1986. Wives' earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 12.1 percent from an average $ 14,064 in 1979 to $ 15,768 in 1986, the study says, while husbands' adjusted earnings dropped from $ 23,204 in 1979 to $ 22,240 in 1986. Even with wives working, the study says, roughly two out of five <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families _ those earning less than about 27,000 a year in 1986 _ earned more than they did 10 years ago but the increase did not keep up with inflation. Adjusted income for all Americans increased 7.3 percent, however. If women had worked only the number of hours they did in 1979, the study says, average wages would have increased only 4.9 percent, with three out of five families, or those earning less than $ 40,000, lagging behind the inflation rate. With more women working, average adjusted family income increased from the equivalent of $ 38,492 in 1979 to $ 41,288 in 1986, the study says. The nation's wealthiest 20 percent earned nine times more than the poorest in 1986, compared with seven times in 1979, it says. The top group includes families that earned over $ 59,533 in 1986. Their income averaged $ 94,104, compared with $ 9,133 for the lowest fifth of the population. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said the trend of a widening gap between rich and poor is a reversal from earlier decades. Institute research director <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON> said the report was intentionally released prior to the presidential election, but it was not intended to be issued so close to election day Tuesday. `` We think it's an important part of the debate as to how well people have been doing. This shows evidence that people are struggling to get by and that things are not going as well as they used to,'' he said.

 Sikh separatists attacking across <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state before a major Hindu holiday have killed 62 people, officials reported Saturday. Security forces were ordered on maximum alert. At least 20 Sikh gunmen masquerading as border police killed five Hindus Saturday night in the village of <LOCATION> Darapur </LOCATION>, according to C. Pal <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, inspector general of police along the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He said the killers separated Hindus from Sikhs and opened fire on the Hindus in the main crossroads of the village 39 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The gunmen, who arrived in two police jeeps and wore uniforms of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s border security force, escaped after the massacre, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. Police blamed Sikh extremists for five other attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Friday and Saturday that claimed 57 lives. In addition to those deaths, five Sikh militants were killed by police in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Friday night, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s 32,000-man police force was placed on maximum alert, according to a police spokesman in the state capital of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. Hindus, who form a vast majority in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but are outnumbered by Sikhs in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, will celebrate <LOCATION> Diwali </LOCATION>, a festival of lights, on Wednesday. Police and news reports gave these accounts of the other deaths: Seven bombs exploded Friday in a crowded market in the town of <LOCATION> Batala </LOCATION>, 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, killing 28 people and injuring 50. Most of the victims were Hindus. Also Friday, six Sikh militants raided a farm near the town of <LOCATION> Lawdohwal </LOCATION>, 70 southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, and killed 20 Hindu laborers. Nine people were killed in three other attacks Friday and Saturday. Militant Sikhs have waged a six-year campaign for a separate homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Sikhs say they are discriminated against by the Hindus, who make up 82 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. Sikhs account for about 2 percent of the country's population but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 A strong, early snow storm blasted the upper Great Lakes region Saturday, while late-season tornadoes killed one person and caused scattered damage in parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Strong thunderstorms spread over the Southeast during the morning. A tornado touched down in the community of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in the northern part of the state, and one person was killed, authorities said. At least six houses were destroyed, 10 more were damaged and one business was damaged, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampsom </PERSON>, a director of a local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also reported several tornado sightings from the central Gulf coast to counties inland. Between midnight and 2 a.m. CDT, three tornados ripped up trees, downed power lines, tore off shingles and flattened signs and wooden fences in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. No one was injured, but three houses were damaged. Wind blew at more than 70 mph during a severe thunderstorm in <LOCATION> Levy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and trees and power lines were reported down in neighboring <LOCATION> Citrus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where gusts up to 57 mph were recorded.

One twister touched down near <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and in several residential areas in <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said. The other twister took the roof off a rural house in <LOCATION> Currituck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> City </PERSON> tornado `` kind of took everyone by surprise'' because twisters rarely occur in November, said police Sgt. H.L. Bunch. Thunderstorm wind gusts were measured to 52 mph at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and 70 mph at <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the weather service said.

High wind and blowing snow was expected to cut visibility in some areas to below a mile, authorities and meterologists said. `` We should n't have this to just until about the hunting season, about mid-November'' <PERSON> Homsa </PERSON> said. `` We have snow occasionally before then, but not like this.'' In extreme northeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> only 1 to 3 inches of snow fell, but high wind blew it into drifts about a foot deep. South of the snow belt, freezing rain was scattered over northeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with showers over the lower <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, central through southern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.

 Bombings, shootings and stabbings have left 13 people dead and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic conflicts, official reports said Saturday. An Indian soldier, a Sri Lankan policeman and a Moslem civilian were killed in two bomb explosions in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, 147 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Friday, the government's Lankapuwath news agency reported. It said one bomb exploded in a courthouse and the other went off in a shop patronized by members of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force deployed in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in an effort to end a separatist war by Tamil guerrillas. A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said 10 civilians and four Sri Lankan civilians were wounded in the bombings. Speaking on condition of anonymity, she added that Indian troops killed one Tamil guerrilla and captured 19 others in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Sri Lankan military officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said nine Sinhalese men were shot or stabbed to death in a series of attacks by Sinhalese radicals in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The slayings were carried out by members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> Friday night and Saturday, according to the officials who under standing regulations are not identified by name The government has blamed the front for the killings of more than 500 people since July 30 when <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed an accord designed to end the Tamil guerrilla war against the Sinhalese-dominated government and Sinhalese civilians. The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord, which was rejected by the Tamil guerrillas. The Sinhalese radical group says the accord made too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Sinhalese, who are Buddhists, account for 75 percent. There are small Moslem and Christian minorities. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the internal problems of its small island neighbor through its role as the biggest power in the region and also because some 60 million Tamils live in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>130 Convicted in Mafia Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> court on Saturday convicted 130 people, including two judges, of belonging to a Mafia group that committed crimes throughout <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said 26 defendants were given life sentences in the trial of the `` Clan of <LOCATION> Catanesi </LOCATION>,'' and clan members were blamed for 61 slayings, four kidnappings and hundreds of robberies. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the others convicted received sentences ranging from a few months to 30 years. Sixty-eight people were acquitted at the end of the 19-month-long trial. The `` Clan of Catanesi'' was based in the eastern <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Catania </LOCATION> but expanded its operations nationwide beginning in 1979 with the establishment of bases in the northern cities of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, according to trial testimony quoted by <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Catanesi'' is the word for residents of <LOCATION> Catania </LOCATION>. Most of the killings attributed to the group were linked to drug trafficking. Among those convicted Saturday were two magistrates: <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Perracchio </PERSON>, the former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Catania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assizes </ORGANIZATION> who was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, and <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON>, the former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Catania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, sentenced to two years and eight months.

The judges of the <ORGANIZATION> Turin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assizes </ORGANIZATION> issued the verdicts after 23 days of deliberation. During the trial, seven relatives of informants were killed, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. As the verdicts were read, dozens of police patrolled the area outside the courthouse and a police helicopter circled overhead.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Hurtle Through Final Weekend</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with new polls, inserting new 4th graf</NOTE>

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hurtled through a final weekend of campaigning, the underdog Democrat vowing Saturday to work for those living on `` the family budget, not the family fortune,'' while his rival pledged he would n't be `` outhustled by the liberal governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' The two combatants raced across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at a pace that defied endurance while their managers were pouring millions of dollars into a campaign-ending television advertising drive. The Republicans professed no public concern that their lead might be dwindling in the race's final days. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not jittery. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not jittery,'' said the No. 2 man on the ticket. The latest polls agreed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still led, but differed on the trend. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reported a margin of 52-43, a slight gain for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over results broadcast 24 hours earlier. Pollster <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led 51-44, with the trend slightly in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' favor. Candidates in the 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races and 435 House contests on Tuesday's ballot also went through a final weekend of working, as did the two dozen rivals contesting the 12 statehouse races. Democrats were rated as favorites to renew their control in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and prohibitive favorites to hold a majority in the new House. Everyone was straining for the finish line of a campaign marathon. `` We are all very tired,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking for candidates and their entourages everywhere. Despite the fatigue, there was no letup with the election three days away. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used increasingly sharp tones to criticize <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of running a campaign of `` lies and just plain garbage.'' `` I think the Republican Party began celebrating a little early, do n't you?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to his crowds as he made his way through four states. `` They're taking you for granted.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also had four states on his itinerary, although aides were juggling his schedule on the run in a bid to counter <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' moves. He knocked on doors in one <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> neighborhood, made a few get-out-the-vote telephone calls, painted a campaign sign and told reporters, `` I do n't believe in polls. ... Let someone else sort out all these polls.'' Urged by local Republicans to make a gesture to an industry critical to the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> economy, the vice president endorsed continued import quotas on steel after their scheduled expiration next Sept. 30, barring an international fair trade agreement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned with one eye on the crowds and the other on the spate of polls being conducted over the weekend to chart the race in its final days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides spread the word that their own polls showed a modest improvement in the vice president's support overnight, and claimed a lead in the range of 8-10 points nationally. Democrats said it was more like five or six points. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tabulation showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading for as many as 359 electoral votes. But many of them were from states where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed to be gaining, and the vice president could not count on the 270 needed for victory. The survey showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading for as many as 101 electoral votes, while 78 votes were in states rated as tossups, including <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The two presidential rivals complimented one another in separate interviews with television personality <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, although the words had a certain backhanded quality to them. `` The contacts I've had with him have been very pleasant,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of his rival. `` But I've been accused of liking, liking, you know, almost everybody, and I think there is a lot of good in everyone and certainly in my opponent.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I do n't normally get personally angry or annoyed at the people that I run against.'' He added he was surprised and disappointed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign and added `` there's something I think out of character about this and there are people who know him who believe that.'' So much for the pleasantries, such as they were. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> delivered the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address and campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of false campaign advertising and said the Republican philosophy is, `` If it sounds good, we're going to say it, never mind the facts.'' Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was endorsed by a handful of Democratic municipal and union officials from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and said, `` I will try, if I'm elected, to be a fair-play president in terms of the working men and women in this country and in terms of labor itself.'' In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, he vowed, `` We're not going to be outhustled by the liberal governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' The vice president also brushed aside persistent Democratic complaints about his campaign, saying, `` They can dish it out but they ca n't take it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> depicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a child of privilege who as president would help the wealthy. `` He wants to make the rich in this country even richer,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` We're on the side of people who live off the family budget, not the family fortune.'' The Democrat appeared on stage in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with a man wearing a mask that bore the likeness of former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, `` Yes, it's hard to believe _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s running again, only this time he's using the name <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans in his weekly radio address, and he dusted off an old standby from past campaigns in personal appearances in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We need you to ride with us,'' he told a crowd at a rodeo center in Mesquite, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` And if you would, I hope you'll help win just one more for the Gipper.''

<HEAD>Polls Find Bush Holding Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained a comfortable lead for the presidency in two national opinion polls Saturday, with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slipping a bit after advancing in one of them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by nine points, 52-43 percent, in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Wednesday through Friday, recouping slightly from his seven-point lead in a CBS poll finished the day before. He had led by 12 points in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey early in the week. The new CBS-Times survey indicated a potential for further movement in voter sentiment. It found that a quarter of likely voters were undecided, only leaning or did not rule out changing their minds. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has led by six or more points in every poll since Oct. 10, and has been ahead in nearly every survey since he accepted his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention on Aug. 18. The other poll conducted Wednesday through Friday, by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by six points, 51 percent to 45 percent. That was virtually unchanged from a seven-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll late last week. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> polls have had the race a bit closer than others. Even with his lead, both new polls found some criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 62 percent said the campaign was more negative than usual _ up from 48 percent a few weeks ago _ and more blamed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll, 71 percent agreed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` seems to be running down his opponent too much and not discussing the real issues.'' There were 1,252 likely voters in the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll, 1,452 in the CBS-Times survey. Both had margins of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Wants OPEC To Fix Prices For 2-3 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Saudi Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> on Saturday called on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to fix oil prices for a period of two to three years in its search for a way to stabilize the market. In a statement distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said again that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> will not abide by its OPEC-decreed production quota unless the cartel's 12 other members adhered to theirs. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has not been able to defend its benchmark price of $ 18 per barrel because its member states have been violating their quotas. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is set to examine production quotas later this month and consider increasing the output ceiling to halt violations. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said he hoped the ministerial meeting scheduled for Nov. 21 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> would lead to an agreement on `` a maximum price for a period of two or three years under the meticulous surpervision of production and prescribed quotas to help remedy the disruption and stabilize the market in the interest of all.'' He did not suggest any figures. `` We ... look forward with big hope that the forthcoming meeting of oil ministers of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will produce clear, firm resolutions that define production quotas and the ceiling,'' <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said. He added: `` We are surprised at the insistence of some of the foreign media to pursue the campaign of distortion and incitement against the kingdom.'' He apparently referred to recent reports that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil production had reached 7 million barrels a day when its daily quota was set for 4.365 million barrels. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest oil exporter and the most powerful force in the cartel. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> blamed the chaos in the oil market on `` non-adherence by some member states in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to the resolutions adopted by the organization in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> December 1986'' on production and pricing. `` We have repeatedly said and reaffirm today that the kingdom of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> will be the first state to respect adherence to its defined quota on condition that all member states in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> abide by their quotas in a categoric and decisive manner,'' he said. `` We categorically reject that the kingdom alone abide by its quota while others exceed theirs.''

<TEXT>
 A story in a national magazine on this <LOCATION> Appalachian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> town and its unbending support of the high school football team has residents driving nearly halfway across <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> for copies. People magazine sold out in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> stores soon after it appeared on shelves last week, frustrating residents eager to see the six-page spread. `` It's the biggest demand I've ever had,'' said <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, owner of a downtown newsstand. Storeowners such as <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> are taking special orders for shipments of extra magazines, and a radio station is giving copies away in a special promotion. Many in the eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town of about 5,000 said there was a good reason for the story in People's Nov. 7 issue. The <ORGANIZATION> Pikeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> football squad went undefeated for the second straight season. `` I think it's a good gesture toward the team and the town,'' said Coach <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` It's something this team deserves. You do n't see many teams like this one come down the pike.'' The story focuses on <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>'s 22-0 triumph Oct. 13 over <LOCATION> Paintsville </LOCATION>, which had gone into the game undefeated. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Necessary </PERSON>, distribution manager for a regional magazine wholesaler in <LOCATION> Paintsville </LOCATION>, said she believes People was sold out last week throughout most of eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The wholesaler hoped to get more copies, but some people just were n't willing to wait. Ms. Necessary said distributors in central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> reported <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> residents have driven 145 miles to some stores in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and bought up to 200 copies.

 Between 500 and 1,000 chanting anti-Ku <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> demonstraters celebrated victory Saturday before Independence Hall, a week after white supremacists called off a rally for the same day. A skirmish between so-called `` skinheads'' and the demonstrators broke out in front of the federal building near the Liberty Bell, but no arrests were made, police Capt. <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> <PERSON> Delise </PERSON> said. The anti-Klan rally was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Partisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to protest the proposed rally by the Klan and other white supremacist groups. The committee held their rally despite the Klan's decision to cancel. `` We believe blacks and working people have won a victory and forced the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> and skinheads to back down,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, spokesman for the committee. `` The idea of the mobilization was to make it as broad as possible. Anybody who wanted to stop the Klan was welcome.'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said he did not know how many people the New York-based committee brought to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, but said several buses were used. Speakers led the occasionally rain-soaked crowd in chants of `` Hey, hey, ho ho, the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> has got to go,'' and some people milled around carrying signs protesting the Klan and some calling for a worker's revolution. At least five skinheads showed up for the `` white pride day,'' unaware that the Klan-organized rally was called off Oct. 26 as opposition grew. The skinheads, so-called for their close-cropped hair, wore red-laced, black combat boots and blue jeans, with swastikas and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags pinned to black jackets. They were allowed to stand just north of the anti-Klan rally. `` We originally came up for the Klan rally today. Since we're from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> we did n't know it was canceled,'' said skinhead <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Baranowski </PERSON> `` We did n't come here to get violent.'' He said the Skinheads advocate partitioning the country, setting aside the five Northwestern states for whites and the rest for blacks. Estimates of the crowd size varied, with police counting nearly 500 protesters and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> saying there were nearly 1,000 on hand. Scores of police patrolled the perimeter of the rally on foot and horseback. <PERSON> Delise </PERSON> would not say how many police were there, but park superintendent <PERSON> Hobart </PERSON> <PERSON> Cawood </PERSON> said he had brought in 120 park rangers and police from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to help the 20 park service officers stationed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Tours went on as usual at Independence Hall, where the Constitution was signed, and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. `` It -LRB- free speech -RRB- is one of the marks of our country. It's tragic we have to have so many police police and security,'' said the Rev <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a tourist from <LOCATION> Ligonier </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Amal and Hezbollah Agree To Non-Kidnapping Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Syrian-backed Amal militia and pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday they have agreed to a non-kidnapping pact to avoid a military confrontation between the two main Shiite Moslem factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pact, announced in statements issued by both groups, would apply to abductions by one group of partisans of the other. It would not involve the 14 foreign hostages believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Amal, Arabic for hope, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, have been locked for years in a bloody struggle for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s one million Shiites. The statements issued by the two groups said the agreement was sponsored by the command of the Syrian army contingent in charge of security in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s westerm Moslem sector. But sources on both sides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they doubted the agreement would last despite pressures from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to unify Moslem ranks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians sent troops into south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Shiite slums May 27 to halt battles between the two rivals that left about 300 people killed and 1,000 wounded. A truce was arranged but it has been strained by more kidnappings and the Syrian command pressed both factions to sign the new accord. The statements said the last 17 kidnap victims were exchanged under the auspices of Syrian army officers after the agreement was signed Friday night. The latest effort to end the Hezbollah-Amal feud came after a visit to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> by Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, who made several calls for unity among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem factions and met with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> representatives. These moves appeared to be an effort by both <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> to counter <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recent intervention into Lebanese politics. Arab diplomatic sources say the Iraqis have sent weapons and ammunition to the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main military militia, since a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the Iran-Iraq war Aug. 20 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> went to war in September 1980. Of the 14 foreign hostages believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, nine are Americans. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

 Elections officials on Saturday appealed a judge's order barring the state from using a law that limits people to 10 minutes in the voting booth. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> issued a temporary restraining order Friday, preventing at least three counties from enforcing some measure of the 97-year-old law. `` There has never been stop-watch voting in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ... and there's never been a problem with that provision of the law all these years,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chief deputy secretary of state. His office filed the appeal on behalf of county elections officials. `` There's never been a time where elections officials have pulled voters out of the booth, and that's not how it was going to be used this time,'' he said. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was scheduled to hear arguments Sunday from lawyers representing state and county elections agencies and from civil rights lawyers who claim the limit disenfranchises those with language difficulties or for whom English is a second language. A ruling was not expected until Monday. In barring use of the law, <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> called it a virtual literacy proficiency test, which is specifically outlawed by the federal Voting Rights Act. The temporary restraining order was sought after <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> counties announced they would rely on the measure to speed people through the voting process. Election officials were concerned about a complicated ballot tying up the booths. The decision to enforce the time limit was especially controversial in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where bilingual ballots are not available in the voting booth. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters will be asked to vote for a presidential ticket, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, state candidates, 29 state propositions and a plethora of local races and issues.

 `` L.A. Law'' character <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> might consider himself above joining any club that would have him as a member, but real-life counterparts of the television divorce lawyer decided Saturday they were n't ready to ask him anyway. Against an ever-shifting legal and social backdrop, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matrimonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a four-day meeting to discuss such weighty matters as custody and surrogacy and the economic hardships of no-fault divorce for some women. But tucked between the serious seminars, the academy found time for a panel discussion entitled _ `` <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> _ How Real is He?'' The elite group also mulled over whether he would make a good member. `` I'm not comfortable thinking about <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> or any other character strictly as a role model, because dramatically, that's too limiting a standard to hold him to,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, an `` L.A. Law'' story editor and producer who writes <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s character, portrayed by actor <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, for the popular television show. <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, a lawyer who has put aside his practice while working on `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' sat in on Saturday's panel. `` Like everybody else, <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> has different sides, some heroic and some anything but heroic. ... <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> has done things that if someone I knew in real life had, I'd say, ` What a jerk!' `` By the same token,'' <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> continued, `` he's done some things I greatly admire. And in this company, in dress, behavior and other measures, I'd say he's basically middle of the pack. There are a fair share of matrimonial lawyers more flamboyant than <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, president of the academy, credits <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s character with raising public awareness of the legal specialty, but says it's impossible to know whether the character has actually influenced members of the profession `` The character is bigger than life, but not unreal,'' said <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. `` And we're up closer than most people. We see the warts and freckles, we understand many of the things he goes through. I suppose the jury is still out, to what extent the portrayal has helped.'' The jury returned Saturday, however, with a verdict against <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. By a vote of 50-14, academy members said he should not be considered at this time, said <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. The vote, fortunately, was nothing more than a honorarium and probably wo n't affect <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s television following. Besides, fictional characters can not join the elite academy, which is made up of about 1,000 of the nation's 40,000 divorce lawyers. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION>, by contrast, has about 16,000 members. One thing <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> has going for him is the perception that `` L.A. Law'' has not only glamorized the business, it has encouraged more young people to enroll in law school. `` Enrollment is definitely up,'' said <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, `` but I do n't know whether that means I get the credit or the blame.

<HEAD>Doctors, Others Vow to Ignore AIDS Measure if it Passes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 500 health care professionals have vowed that if a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ballot measure forcing them to report positive AIDS-test results becomes law, they will defy it, a spokesman for the group said Saturday. Employees at the largest anonymous testing center in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> also said they would refuse to reveal names of those who test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus if Proposition 102 is approved on Tuesday. Proposition 102 would ban anonymous testing for the AIDS virus, require health officials and others to report the names of people `` reasonably believed'' to be infected with HIV, and require those infected with the virus to report the names of their spouse or sexual partners. Insurance companies could also test for the virus. `` The bottom line is when police come to our door and ask for the names, we'll have to say we will not be accomplices to something designed for discrimination,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Yoel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sha'ar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zahav </ORGANIZATION>, which operates an outreach to the gay and lesbian community in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` The irresponsibile use of this information can result in people losing jobs, their health insurance and their homes,'' added <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, who fears that as a clergyman he may be required to report those carrying the virus. Under the initiative, doctors face misdemeanor charges and fines of $ 250 for each patient they fail to report. Despite that, Dr. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Huen </PERSON>, medical director of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, said 50 physicians had signed a pledge not to report the names of patients infected with HIV. `` I signed it. I will not turn over anyone in my practice,'' <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. `` This is bad public health policy because it will keep people away from being tested and treatment because of fear that they will be reported.'' <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said many staff members are considering shredding patient records if the initiative passes. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmeri </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Alternative Test Site, said workers have decided if the measure passes they will continue offering free anonymous HIV tests. `` Under no condition will we give out names,'' <PERSON> Salmeri </PERSON> said. Supporters of the measure reacted angrily to the pledge program. `` I do not think responsible people should ask people to break the law,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mero </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> co-sponsored the initiative with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>, the tax crusader who helped spearhead property tax-slashing Proposition 13 a decade ago, and who is now suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome because of a tainted blood transfusion. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> provoked an outcry from medical experts last week when he announced he would vote for the proposition. Three members of an advisory state AIDS committee resigned their positions in protest. The governor's endorsement prompted <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> to denounce the measure, saying it would set back AIDS research a minimum of five years.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told supporters in the Lone Star state on Saturday that even though he's `` riding off into the sunset,'' the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era can continue if voters cast their ballots for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pulled out all the sentimental stops as he battled for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a one-day trip to the battleground states of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on the final weekend of the presidential campaign. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with 20 electoral votes, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with 29, are crucial for the Democrats. The president appealed directly to conservative Democrats in both states, who could put his vice president over the top in the ever-tightening race against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said this campaign is special for him. `` The election is in just three days and I'm on my final campaign swing,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. At a suburban <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> rodeo grounds, he said, `` Although, come January, I'm going to be riding off into the sunset, I feel a little like I'm on the ballot myself this year.'' At the indoor arena, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived in a horse-drawn carriage. The president, clad in a brown suit and waving a gray cowboy hat, smiled and waved as the crowd hollered. Although not naming him, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> up to ridicule as the candidate who will `` take <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> backwards,'' and hailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the man of the future. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stands on the brink of an era of national greatness that will exceed anything that any country on Earth has ever known before,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boasted. Only if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted, will the nation's economy continue on the upswing, will Communism remain `` in retreat,'' and will `` American culture and technology dominate the world. `` From television's <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>, to the space shuttle Discovery, an entire planet is watching and following us, and yes, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> truly is the envy of the world,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Mesquite, he cautioned aginst complacency and overconfidence. `` We need you to vote, we need you to ride with us. And if you would, I hope you'll help win just one more for the Gipper. And really, let's all do this together for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The president is set to make a trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Monday in an attempt to stall any election-eve slide of his home state's 47 electoral votes toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said during the trip back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Saturday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> felt `` very good'' about his day of campaigning and looks forward to the visit to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finds the race to be a close one. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said White House tracking information showed `` our opposition's effort in recent days appears to have leveled off and a surge has returned to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' And as he has for the past week of cross-country campaign jaunts on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the choice between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a clear one. At a rally in <ORGANIZATION> Macomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rival of opposing voluntary prayer in school, supporting gun control and a `` weak-kneed defense policy'' and appointing `` left-wing judges'' such as those `` in a state like <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' `` That's why I'm here today: to bring home the simple fact that all the progress we have made is on the line. Today's activities are part of a get-out-the-vote campaign and I just want to tell each one of you to go to the polls on Tuesday and get your friends to go, too _ to cast their and your votes for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I want to ask those of you some people call <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats to join me and come home with me today. Come home to me and to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his weekly taped radio address, hailed the `` vibrant and fractious and exciting'' campaign year. `` There is no sight more moving than a lone American walking to that voting booth, casting a ballot in secret, and thereby determining the destiny of this great country,'' he said. He added another plug for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Yes, my fellow Americans, there is a choice, a very important choice _ a vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a vote for optimism. ... It's an endorsement of what we've done these past eight years, and of our heartfelt promise that tomorrow and the days to come will be brighter still,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on Saturday inaugurated this federally-sponsored <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast resort, 30 years before the project's scheduled completion. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> toured a new medical center, other public facilities built by the government for <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>'s burgeoning population and the 500-room Club Med and 320-room Sheraton. <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>, about 340 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 270 miles southeast of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, was begun four years ago. It is now largely roads and water and power lines cut into the semitropical jungle. During the inaugural ceremony, Tourism Secretary <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Savignac </PERSON> assailed illegal land takeovers in the area as harmful to the nation's tourism trade and potential foreign investment. <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Savignac </PERSON> also criticized local landholders who refused to move to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crucecita </LOCATION>, a town the government built a little more than a mile inland for <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>'s current and future populations. <PERSON> Huatalco </PERSON> includes nine bays along a 20-mile stretch of coastline. Each of the nine bays will have a different theme, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacho </PERSON>, vice president for marketing for the government tourism agency <ORGANIZATION> Fonatur </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION>, the last of major government-sponsored resorts to be developed under a 1968 master plan, is scheduled to be completed in the year 2018. <PERSON> Cacho </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> is geared to the North American market, with some 80 percent of foreign visitors expected to come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and another 10 percent from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The government projects <LOCATION> Huatulco </LOCATION> will host about 100,000 tourists in 1989 and more than 2 million a year when completed. Between 5.6 million and 5.7 million tourists will come to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> this year, according to government projections.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to rally final-weekend support Saturday in a rapid series of campaign stops, knocking on doors, working telephones, painting signs and declaring `` let someone else sort out all these polls.'' In a day of cross-country campaigning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed new public opinion polls suggesting he was still ahead of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Duakakis </PERSON> but by a narrowing margin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s route on Saturday in part shadowed campaign stops by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> strategists sought to blunt the Democrat's concluding campaign blitz `` I do n't believe in polls,'' the vice president told reporters in <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, during a morning visit to his <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> campaign headquarters, where he briefly worked a phone bank and got down on hands and knees to help children paint campaign signs. At a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Immaculata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Malvern </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, with its 25 electoral votes, critical. `` It can go either way. I am going to work not just here but all across the country, from this coast to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. We are not going to be outhustled by the liberal governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, `` Let someone else sort out all these polls.'' But he also added, `` Do I feel I've got a good shot at winning? Absolutely. But I'm not going to turn things around at the last moment and try to lighten up.'' `` We ca n't go any further or work any harder,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president and his entourage also walked door-to-door along a leafy street of an affluent neighborhood in <LOCATION> Westfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, calling on people in three houses and urging them to vote for him. `` The invasion squad, hitting your beautiful home,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked at the first home he visited. `` We were overwhelmed, to say the least,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited her and her husband <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. She said the majority of the neighborhood was `` very pro-Bush.'' He also planned a get-out-the vote street walk in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, before heading to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and then head back east again for more campaigning in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> before ending on Monday in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. As Saturday's campaign activities drew to a close, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters aboard his plane: `` We're in the highest degree of tension. ... Sometimes I get extraordinarily tired, but it's understandable. `` Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I do n't,'' he continued. `` It's the total tension. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials kept making last minute schedule changes based on overnight polls _ and taking into account <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' movements At the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> campaign office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was endorsed by a handful of Democratic municipal and union officials from nearby comunities. `` I will try, if I'm elected, to be a fair-play president in terms of the working men and women in this country and in terms of labor itself,'' he told campaign workers afterward. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp shrugged off a CBS poll released Friday indicating his double-digit lead of a week ago was shrinking _ to seven points from 12. A survey released Saturday by the network showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> increasing the lead to nine points, 52-43. His wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, said, `` I do n't believe the polls. We take our own polls and ours look all right.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who rode one leg of Saturday's campaign swing on the plane chartered by news organizations, added, `` We are all very tired.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the campaign was constantly shifting its schedule to shore up support in key battleground states and to attempt to outmaneuver <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also walked down the main street of <LOCATION> Chillicothe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, in a cold drizzle, giving thumbs-up signs and shaking hands with many of the several thousand townspeople who lined both sides of the street. He vowed in a speech in front of the town fire station, as he has done for days, to `` run as if I was ten points back.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the town as `` middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with the strongest values that exist.'' Meanwhile, a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said that shadowing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` one aspect'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy in his final drive. `` It's a complicated strategy,'' the official said. `` You bracket him -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB-. You checkmate him. You fuzz up his message by using his own language against him.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief-of-staff, said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> _ the next stop _ was a state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been firmly ahead but in which the race `` has tightened.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remaining travel was being guided entirely from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by campaign Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>. `` ` My colleagues in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are cool and cautious. They are concerned when there is any signs of shrinkage,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Campaign officials, meanwhile, said two new ads would be aired nationally through Monday. <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, a campaign official, said both were positive ads, one a photo composite with singer-composer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> singing `` God Bless the U.S.A'' in the background, the other showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sitting talking.

 Employers fearing penalties under the new federal immigration law are discriminating against legal aliens and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who appear to be foreigners, according to a study. The study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Immigration Affairs confirmed fears expressed by experts who said the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 would result in discriminatory behavior against certain workers. The report, which was to be released Monday, found that many employers were still unfamiliar with provisions of the new law and that some simply refuse to consider job applicants who look or sound foreign. `` It is clear from our data that the scope of these -LRB- discriminatory -RRB- practices is broad,'' the task force panel said. The panel estimated that more than 22,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens or aliens authorized to work `` were either temporarily denied work or not hired by an employer'' in the state. The act offered amnesty to eligible aliens until May 4 of this year and, starting in June, called for stiff fines and other sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. The task force based its study on 400 randomly placed telephone calls last month to employers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The federal <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which is required by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to investigate evidence of employer discrimination concerning the law, is expected to release its own report on Monday.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Saturday, accused his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents of `` big brother tactics'' aimed at intimidating Hispanics and discouraging them from voting. He called on Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to apologize and to halt radio commercials airing along the Mexican border that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> allege may discourage qualified minority voters from going to the polls. `` If you believe as we believe that the right to vote freely and without intimidation is the most sacred right we have as Americans, I'm sure you share my anger at these <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> radio commercials,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The only purpose for those ads is to scare voters into not voting,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` ... These big brother tactics have no place in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, have no place in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. This is not a dictatorship; this is a democracy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, waging an intensive final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's presidential election, spoke to several thousand people at an evening rally outside the <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>. Making a final push to carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he trails in the polls, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to this town in southernmost <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It was near <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, the home of running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his first stop following his nomination at the Democratic convention in July. Advertisement being aired in the heavily Hispanic area remind listeners it is illegal for non-citizens to vote and say `` election officials will be on guard.'' The ads mention possible jail terms and fines. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would look into possible intimidation. `` I think it's time that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repudiated those ads and stopped them and apologized to you,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Earlier Saturday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to a large crowd in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and said of the Republicans, `` They were taking you for granted.'' Later, in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of campaigning on `` lies and just plain garbage,'' and said, `` I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are fed up with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign _ they're fed up with the negativism and the falsehoods and the misrepresentations.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fast-paced schedule took him from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on the last Saturday of his presidential campaign. At each stop, he declared that large and enthusiastic crowds were a sign that, despite his deficit in public opinion polls, he was overtaking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Do I smell victory in the air?'' he said. `` You can feel it and sense it and taste it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to a crowd gathered inside an airport baggage room in Lansing before flying to the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Hundreds more stood outside in the rain, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sprinted through the rain to shake hands and greet those who waited in the downpour. The Democrat heaped fresh scorn on <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said in a television interview with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> that if elected he might put <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> crisis management group. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In charge of managing the most serious crises we face in the country? That's a frightening thing, is n't it?'' In <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor depicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a child of privilege who as president would benefit only the most wealthy. `` He wants to make the rich in this country even richer,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We're on the side of people who live off the family budget, not the family fortune,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared on the stage at a <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> exhibition hall with a man wearing a mask that looked like former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> compared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to that former president, who resigned in disgrace. `` Just as there was no new <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1968, there is no new <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1988,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his claim that his campaign is coming back. `` He's coasting and we're fighting back,'' he said. `` He's slipping and we're surging. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, buoyed by a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll showing a narrowing margin with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was campaigning at a frenetic pace in the final days to the election. He flew to <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and from there flew to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for rallies in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He was flying on to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> late in the evening and was heading to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending nearly every available moment in search of votes. He planned a day of campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Monday and a middle-of-the-night rally in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on his red-eye flight home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to vote and await the returns. Aides were considering a final stop in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, too, on the way home. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll released Friday night showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 7 percentage points, down from 12 points just three days earlier. Campaign aides contended their own polling had the race close in battleground states, although <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials said he remained well behind in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, defeated in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, says he `` was a heartbeat away from the presidency'' and suggests he will run for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1992 if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> loses. `` If <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> loses on Tuesday, the next political season will begin on Wednesday,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> published in Sunday's editions.

 A graduate student suspected of creating a `` virus'' that invaded computer nerve centers nationwide, started playing with computers in his teens and has been fascinated with them since, his father said Saturday. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, a top government computer-security expert, refused to comment on whether his son, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, concocted the virus that clogged an estimated 6,000 military and university machines. At any rate, he said, the episode may prevent a serious security breach in the future. `` It's going to be remembered for a long time,'' said the elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` And I think we'll see a substantial improvement in the way computers and networks are administered.'' In an interview at their home in <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, about 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said her son got his first summer job working with computers when he was 15, and a series of similar summer jobs followed. As children, all three of the <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> youngsters read a science fiction book called `` Shock Wave Rider'' that was the first publication to raise questions about computer viruses in his own mind. `` That was one of the most tattered books in our kids' room,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. Both parents said their son is a likable, attractive young man who is `` highly skilled'' with computers. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the virus episode will `` clearly raise the awareness of the existing vulnerabilities, particularly of network systems.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> also said he felt ambivalent about the incident. `` I'm close to this in two ways,'' he said. `` I myself am a computer user but I'm also a father. That makes it difficult to separate the two roles, although, of course, they have to be separated.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he is convinced the virus was unleashed accidentally. `` It seems there was no malicious intent involved. No harm was intended or actually done in the host computers, other than overload, and that appears to be a design error,'' he said. However, he said both he and his son are taking steps to obtain legal representation. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who attends <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, could not be reached for comment Saturday. His roommate said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> did not come home Friday and she did not know where he was.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student whose father is a top government computer-security expert is suspected of creating the `` virus'' that slowed thousands of computers nationwide, school officials said Saturday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, a first-year student in a doctorate computer science program, has a reputation as an expert computer hacker and is skilled enough to have written the rogue program, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> instructor <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources as saying <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> created the virus, which on Wednesday night began infecting an estimated 6,000 university and military computers connected through the Arpanet computer network established by the Pentagon. The virus slowed down computers by replicating itself over and over and taking up memory space, but it is not believed to have destroyed any data. The origin of such programs is hard to investigate, and it may be impossible to trace the virus back to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, vice president of information technologies at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this stage we're simply not in a position to determine if the allegations are true,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said he did not know how long the investigation would take. `` It's quite conceivable we may not be able to say with any certainty'' if the virus was created in <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s computer system, he said. He said the university had been contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, but there was no indication any criminal charges would be filed. Officials said the school could discipline <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> if he was involved. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determine whether federal law had been violated. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Saturday. His roommate, <PERSON> Chansong </PERSON> <PERSON> Da </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> did not come home Friday and she did not know where he was. University officials also were unable to contact him, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. Reached at his home Saturday in <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, would not say where his son was. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> his son is `` simply unavailable ... and will remain unavailable until he has time to retain a lawyer.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said he met with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents for about an hour Saturday to explain why his son will not immediately comply with their request. He said the family has had preliminary discussions with an attorney and expects to hire one by Monday. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he is in regular contact with his son and that they have discussed the allegations. `` I certainly will not report anything of our conversations,'' he said. `` I am simply not in a position to deny or confirm the allegations. I have no direct knowledge.'' A federal law enforcement official confirmed Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is attempting to determine what role <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' son may have played in creating the virus. The inquiry is `` rapidly developing right now,'' the official said. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has written widely on the security of the Unix operating system, the target of his son's virus program, the Times reported. He is widely known for writing a program to decipher passwords, which give users access to computers. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> officials said they began examining <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' computer files Friday night after the Times identified him. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had passwords in his files `` for some computers at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> to which he is not entitled,'' although those could have been placed there by someone else, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. A computer file dated Oct. 26 found in <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s system Saturday is the earliest indication that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> may have been writing the program that spawned the virus, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. The Times reported in its Sunday editions that friends of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' said he quickly realized the virus program was out of hand and that he arranged for a friend to send out instructions oh how to eradicate the virus The instructions, however, were posted on a so-called electronic bulletin board that few people would see, the newspaper said. The purpose of the virus program was to spread a tiny program throughout the country and the rest of the world and have it secretly take up residence in computers' memories, the paper said. The program was to always `` hide'' in the background to escape detection. It probably was n't a malicious act, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Krafft </PERSON>, research associate in computer science at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. `` It would have been extremely simple to take this virus structure one step further so that it was extremely destructive,'' <PERSON> Krafft </PERSON> said. `` With a couple more lines -LRB- in the program -RRB- it could have wiped out files in all 6,000 computers.'' The computers affected by the virus all used the Unix 4.3 operating system program, a modification of the Unix system developed by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T that was produced by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Unix operating systems are the most popular software for workstation and medium sized computers. If it was <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, he `` apparently found a gaping hole in the system that I'm amazed no one exploited before,'' <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON> said. While the loophole in the system was not evident before the virus was unleashed, `` in retrospect it's really quite obvious.'' `` He is reputed to be a good hacker, and I guess this would be the proof of it if it's found that he did cause -LRB- the virus -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, said the younger <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> worked in the company's <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> during the summers of 1983 and 1984 and that his job included writing computer programs. The Times quoted computer scientists as saying one of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' projects at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was rewriting security software for most computers that run the Unix system The summers were before and after <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' freshman year at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he received his undergraduate degree, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> at the time. `` From what I hear, he is extremely bright, obviously,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The code he worked on was intended for internal use only. The programs were not intended for use outside of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> worked at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Whippany </LOCATION> for 26 years before retiring in 1986. Some computer centers were forced to disconnect from Arpanet and shut computers down, but by Friday most reported that the virus had been eradicated. However, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, researchers decided Friday evening to pull off Arpanet `` for the duration.'' `` This virus has too many skills and it's not worth the risk,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomes </PERSON>, a research programmer at the school. Experts there thought they had defeated the virus, only to find that the system had been reinfected. Some researchers said the virus had several variations and that it was making an effort to capture passwords and break the `` super user'' code, which allows a user to work on a system with no restrictions at all. Despite his reputation as a hacker, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was an average student who kept to himself, according to faculty and fellow students. `` I have n't seen too much of him in my course,'' <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON> said. `` He's said to be brilliant but that's directed to a certain area and that area is not his classes. I get the feeling he does n't waste too much time on homework, but put him at a keyboard and he's a whiz.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> led a group of emotional speakers Saturday in a call for the arrest of Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> and others for their part in the 1985 MOVE bombing. Attorney <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would not be specific about the group's plans to protest the lack of indictments by two grand juries, but he said he, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and others would continue speaking out until officials who directed the police siege of the group's fortified west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> row house are convicted `` The person who called for the bombing must be arrested immediately, indicted immediately and convicted immediately, and the first person who must go to jail is <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury and a federal grand jury both decided not to return any indictments in the May 1985 bombing, which started a fire that left 11 people dead in the MOVE house and destroyed 61 homes. Earlier in the week, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said a lawsuit would be filed on behalf of <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laverne </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>, whose brother, MOVE leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Africa </PERSON>, died in the confrontation. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> owned the MOVE house, but did not live there at the time of the bombing. The rebuilt house has since been confiscated. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> would not say whether there are definite plans to file suit, but said he and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> are seeking a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the bombing. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> declined extensive comment after the federal grand jury released its findings, saying at the time, `` Two grand juries have fully investigated this matter and have reached a point of no criminality involved. For that I am pleased.'' Neither <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> nor his press secretary, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Warrington </PERSON>, could be reached for comment Saturday night. Neither has a listed phone number. `` The same grand jury system that has plagued us in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and rendered a very racist and Nazi-like verdict in the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case has even more so returned a ruthless verdict to these two women,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said, referring to Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> have served as advisers to Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, who was found last fall with dog feces spread on her and racial slurs scratched in her skin. She said she had been abducted and raped by six white men, some of whom were flashing police-like badges. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grand jury recently ruled <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who refused to testify before the panel, fabricated the story. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and the others spoke to about 100 people at a west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> nightclub Saturday. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> began sobbing when she recalled identifying the bodies of her son and brother who died in the MOVE bombing. `` There were two gurneys. One with what was left of my son and on another a torso _ no head, no legs,'' she said. She chastised <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> residents for not coming to her aid in the three years since the bombing and said it was a shame she had to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to find a champion for her cause in <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said he is just now stepping forward on the issue because the federal grand jury declined to issue an indictment in September.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Saturday exercised a pocket veto of legislation that would have limited advertising during children's TV shows and required stations to provide informative programming for youngsters. The president said in a statement that while he supports efforts to improve the quality of children's programs, `` this bill simply can not be reconciled with the freedom of expression secured by our Constitution.'' The bill, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a voice vote in October and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a 328-78 margin in June, would have reimposed advertising limits abandoned by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had said the marketplace itself could best regulate commercials. `` While I applaud efforts to increase the amount and quality of children's television programming, the Constitution simply does not empower the federal government to oversee the programming decisions of broadcasters in the manner prescribed by this bill,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his statement. Children's TV advocates had pressed for passage of the legislation, maintaining that under the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s philosophy of deregulation, advertising during children's shows has increased and the quality of the programs has deteriorated. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mass.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> which has pushed for the bill for 20 years, said the veto was `` another example of ideological child abuse in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' `` The ultimate effect of the veto is that we will continue to have a broadcast industry that spends all its time figuring how to benefit from children instead of how to benefit children,'' she said. The bill would have limited commercials in children's program to 10 -LCB- minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. Stations would have had until 1990 to comply with the advertising limits. It also would have required stations to `` serve the educational and information needs of children'' in their overall programming. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> would evaluate those efforts in considering whether to renew stations licenses. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his veto message, said that `` conditioning license renewals upon the federal government's determination as to the adequacy of a licensee's programming would violate the First Amendment.'' `` It would inhibit broadcasters from offering innovative programs that do not fit neatly into regulatory categories and discourage the creation of programs that might not satisfy the tastes of agency officials responsible for considering license renewals,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> had said the legislation was `` unnecessary and ill-advised,'' particularly because the commission was considering taking action on its own related to the commercialization of children's television. The legislation was a bipartisan compromise that had been stripped of a proposal to prohibit programs that feature toy manufacturers' products. Critics call such shows `` program-length commercials.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, which helped craft the compromise, said of the bill: `` While we recognize this legislation charted some new territory we were willing to accept its outcome.'' `` Frankly, we expected the president to sign it.'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said. `` Under any circumstances, we are very sensitive to our responsibility to provide quality programming to children and we will continue to do so with or without legislation.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also signed a number of other measures that won legislative approval in the waning days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: _ A law banning the sale of lawn darts, a game that is blamed for the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands of others. The bill requires the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to carry out the ban, which is moving to do so on its own. _ The so-called `` <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> bill,'' designed to protect the privacy of video store customers by prohibiting the unauthorized release of information about what tapes they rent or purchase. The bill grew out of last year's hearings on the nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. During the deliberations, a weekly newspaper in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, obtained and published the video rental records of <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, whose nomination ultimately was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. _ A law banning the shipment of real-looking toy guns and of imitation guns unless they have a blaze orange plug in the barrel. The law was enacted in part because of shootings in which imitations were mistaken for real weapons. _ A law extending for two years the temporary authority for cash awards by inspectors general to federal employees whose disclosures of fraud and mismanagement result in cost savings to the government. _ A law designating certain lands and waters in <LOCATION> Pettaquamscutt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, a National Wildlife Refuge.

<HEAD>A Penny Saved Is No Way To Invest In Copper</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 With copper at record-high prices near $ 1.50 a pound, you could convert your life savings to pennies, sell them as scrap and pocket a nice piece of change, right? Wrong. The economics of the recycling business aside, you'd have to melt nearly $ 73 worth of today's pennies to extract a pound of copper. According to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint, today's pennies are 2.5 percent copper and 97.5 percent zinc. Pre-1982 pennies are 95 percent copper. But at 181 pennies to the pound, even the copper-rich oldies wo n't be worth more than their face value unless copper's value surpasses $ 1.92 _ and it might. Some analysts are even talking about $ 2 copper, which does not seem far-fetched considering the metal's dramatic gains over the past two years. In November 1986, copper for spot delivery on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was worth about 60 cents a pound. Spot copper closed Friday on the Comex at $ 1.49. Many experts expect the worldwide copper shortage caused by lagging production and labor disputes to persist until the second half of 1989, which means copper likely will remain a bull market for some time. But there are ways other than penny-pinching to profit from it. Unlike the array of investment vehicles available for precious metals, investing in copper is pretty much limited to futures, stocks and the physical copper market. Copper futures are traded on the Comex in 25,000-pound lots. Futures traders agree to buy and sell these huge amounts of copper for future delivery but they almost always cash out of the market before the delivery date. Small-investor participation in the copper futures market has surged in the past year and continues to grow, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, metals-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large Chicago-based commodities brokerage firm. `` A lot of small traders have picked up on this market,'' he said. The number keeps growing, he said, `` as the market continues to throw out more and more bullish signals.'' Trading in copper stocks also has increased, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgher </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Barrett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Shares of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, Ariz.-based <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest copper producer, reached an all-time high of $ 49.50 this past week on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after beginning the year at $ 32.50, <PERSON> Burgher </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Asarco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copper producer, is trading around $ 29.50 after hitting a low of $ 29.37 -LCB- earlier this year, he said. Between the worldwide shortage and the 2 -LCB- - week-old copper miners' strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, `` I think copper is going to go much higher,'' <PERSON> Burgher </PERSON> Copper recycling is also on the rise. The Institute of the Scrap Recycling Industry, a Washington-based trade association, estimated that the amount of copper recovered from scrap will rise about 5 percent this year to 3.314 million tons from 3.152 million tons in 1987. Industrial scrap accounts for the bulk of copper recycling but `` back-yard recyclers'' also are getting into the act, said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, associate editor of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION>, a daily newspaper of the scrap metal industry. `` There's been an increase in the collection of obsolete copper scrap _ old electrical wire, copper tubing,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. `` People like electricians and plumbers save it and sell it when the price gets high _ and the markets real right, right now.'' But several scrap brokers contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said they had no interest in recycling pennies. `` It's barely worth stooping over to pick up a penny,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Egly </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Ace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, Ill.

<HEAD>Wall Street Prepares For Quarterly Treasury Auction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As voters head to the polls to elect a new president, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be at the auction block peddling $ 30 billion in new securities to replenish the government's coffers Up for sale to Wall Street's biggest brokers, and later to be sold by them to the public, are $ 19 billion in three - and 10-year notes and $ 11 billion of 37-day cash management bills But absent again from the three-day quarterly refinancing schedule, which begins on Election Day, is the 30-year bond. As was the case in the previous auction, the government lacked the authority to issue any more long bonds. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> hopes to sell $ 9 billion of them later this month or early in December after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signs an authorizing tax bill. Proceeds from the election-week sale will be used toward raising $ 2.2 billion in new cash and refinancing $ 16.8 billion in old debt, part of the $ 2.6 trillion national debt. Economists are split as to how the auction might go, since it comes at a time of great uncertainty as the nation elects a new leader and interest rates continue to rise. Most, though, agree that yields will have to be high enough to attract domestic and foreign money. `` I think the yield levels will be more attractive from an investor's standpoint,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. And if his forecast is correct, that interest rates will ease up after the election, that should be especially sweet for buyers at this quarter's auction. `` But patience has to be exhibited,'' he warned. Economists agree a potential saving grace of the auction will be the absence of the 30-year bond. `` Too many things are happening and none of them are good for bonds,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` Not having a long bond is probably a great help because it's a high-risk piece of paper and hard to adjust so quickly in front of changing economic circumstances.'' The bellwether 30-year bond plunged in value and its rate soared Friday after the government reported that the nation's October unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 5.3 percent _ the lowest level since May 1984. The credit markets were unnerved by the fact the report showed employers added 325,000 new jobs last month, an indication that the manufacturing sector of the economy remains strong and higher inflation may not be far behind. But some economists argue the markets have overreacted a bit. `` There are two sides to this economy,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The production side is rolling along at a good clip. -LRB- But -RRB- there are signs that point to a slowdown in demand from the consumer sector ... and that should prevent inflation.'' Still, he and others concede whatever voters decide at the polls can change even the best-prepared economic forecasts.

<TEXT>
 The dollar's summer radiance has turned as pale as the withered late-autumn leaves. Pessimism about the dollar's outlook intensified this past week, not only because of evidence the economy is slowing down, but also over uncertainties about the monetary policies of the next president, whoever he may be. Although the dollar rose Friday on surprisingly strong October employment figures reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, many currency strategists said they believe the dollar's value will continue to erode. This assessment represents a shift from about three weeks ago in how the world viewed the dollar, which was strong and resilient through the summer and part of the fall. The selling pressure hurt the dollar especially in the beginning of the week, despite efforts by the central banks of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stem the weakness by purchasing dollars in the foreign exchange markets. Much of the reason lies in government economic statistics that point to a slowdown in what had been a modestly expanding economy. Late last month, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said third-quarter growth slowed to 2.2 percent, the lowest in nearly two years. Last Tuesday the department said its Index of Leading Indicators forecasting gauge fell 0.1 percent in September, the third drop in five months. This suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank, would not be forced to pre-empt inflation by raising interest rates. Such a move at least in the short term would have boosted the dollar's value by making dollar-denominated investments worth more. After trading at about 130 Japanese yen and more than 1.85 West German marks in the middle of October, the dollar has since fallen to about 125 yen, a nearly 4 percent decline, and 1.79 marks, a 3.2 percent drop. `` I think you have to say concern about the economy is the main reason,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` When you go back to the summer and say why was the dollar strong, it was because of relatively high interest rates and expectations of higher interest rates to come,'' he said. `` Now people are coming around to the view that we have n't been getting higher rates and perhaps getting lower rates.'' Another important reason for the dollar's most recent depreciation is the Tuesday presidential election, many strategists say. Although most believe Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, both candidates have offered only vague ideas for how to reduce <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s swollen trade and budget deficits, key areas of concern that have battered the dollar's value in the past. `` Everybody is bearish on the dollar,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, senior foreign exchange analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting concern in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Earlier, financial markets would have viewed a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory as much more of a boost for the dollar and the capital markets. Now they're not so sure,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. `` We're not hearing convincing stories on either side on how the deficits will be reduced.'' Even if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were to promote a sound plan for reducing the deficits, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said, `` a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be ready to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back his own. They are going to resist legislation he proposes.'' Though a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> victory is considered increasingly remote, the dollar likely would tumble if he won, largely because his supervision over the unwieldy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is untested, other currency strategists said. `` At this point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is more of a known commodity, whereas a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration is a total unknown,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> ASB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> management, a Washington-based investment advisory service. `` Even the people in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration would n't be sure how they'd manage policy if they got in. Despite the prevalent view that the dollar will decline, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said the Friday unemployment report showing joblessness hit a 14-year low of 5.3 percent last month may have diluted some of the pessimism about the currency and at least keep it stable for a while beyond the election. `` Everybody involved in pricing financial assets all bought the slowdown thesis,'' he said. `` What remains now, if you're an optimist, is that the economy's doing well, not booming, not weakening.''

<HEAD>Election Puts Wall Street in Cold Sweat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The arrival of November plunged the stock market from a raging fever into a cold sweat. In the wake of `` takeover fever,'' which swept through Wall Street in October's final days, a chill settled in this past week when the market began to nervously count down the days until Tuesday's presidential election. Many institutional investors clung to the sidelines, leaving the field to professionals and putting a damper on trading volume. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials barely stirred all week, finishing with a net loss of 4.09 points at 2,145.80. Although Wall Street expects <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ its favored candidate _ to win, there's been enough uncertainty to keep investors on edge. Political poll-watching seems to have replaced technical chart-watching for the moment. The market came to life briefly on Thursday, when the shaky dollar stabilized and the Dow average brushed against the 2,178 mark before ending the day at 2,170.34. Then on Friday, new unemployment data showing surprising strength in the economy drove the blue-chip indicator down 24.54 points. The government reported that the nation's jobless rate fell to 5.3 percent in October, the lowest level in 14 years, as the economy created more than 300,000 jobs. Through most of the week, anticipation of the jobless data had given the market another thing to worry about and deepened its pre-election anxiety. `` People sort of threw in the towel for this week,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Once the hoopla of the election is over, <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> probably will pick up where it left off before the takeover frenzy hit _ worrying about interest rates Early in the week, many observers had been expecting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to keep credit policy and interest rates stable in the near future. Recent signs that the economy is slowing and inflationary pressures are easing would make the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loathe to push interest rates higher, they believed. That view gained credence Monday when <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has slowed in the third quarter and will grow by 1 percent to 2 percent next year. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that recent economic data have allayed fears of rekindled inflation. But a recent slide in the dollar raised concern that the central bank could nudge interest rates higher to bolster the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Although the dollar steadied late in the week, the fear of higher rates was rekindled by Friday's unemployment figures. `` The level of short-term interest rates remains the most important likely determinant of stock prices,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurock </PERSON>, publisher of the Astute Investor newletter out of <LOCATION> Paoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Lower short-term rates would help stimulate business.'' Besides the stagnant Dow, other readings for the week showed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index down 1.38 at 155.70, the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market down 1.75 at 381.02, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index off 2.28 at 297.52. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 150.50 million shares a day, down from 170.03 million the week before.
