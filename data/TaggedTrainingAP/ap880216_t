 An arsonist who burned the town's elementary school and damaged a church that opened its doors to students may have set a fire Monday that destroyed another church and its classrooms, authorities said. Omak, a central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> town of 4,000 that boasts <LOCATION> Okanogan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s only stoplight, has been terrorized by the arson spree. `` It's affected everyone in town. People are very, very grim,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, managing editor of the weekly Omak Chronicle. `` They were somber as they drove by it going to work this morning. It was still burning.'' The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was heavily damaged in a January fire, its second in two months. In the past two weeks, two churches and a church parsonage have been set afire. `` They're a kook ... someone who is unbalanced,'' said <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, superintendent of Omak's school district. School officials have checked through their records for any former employee or student who has a grudge but have turned up nothing, he said. `` One of the interesting things in Omak is we have n't had any particular problems with people, have n't had anyone out there we could identify who had been on our case for any particular reason,'' <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. Police Chief <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirois </PERSON> said police are looking at two or three `` persons of interest'' at this point. Police have interviewed about a dozen people so far, he said. He declined to say why the `` persons of interest'' might have wanted to harm the schools or churches. Firefighters on Monday extinguished the latest fire, which destroyed the $ 1.5 million Omak Presbyterian Church. The church and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had served as temporary classrooms after the fire at the elementary school, which served students in kindergarten though second grade. Last week, the Methodist church sustained about $ 200,000 in damage. A fire set there Saturday and at the parsonage next door on Sunday caused an additional $ 30,000 in damage, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, assistant chief of the eight-person Omak police force. `` It's got everybody on the edge,'' said pastor <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, who lives across the street from his Presbyterian Church. `` They're nervous ... waiting to see what's going to happen next.'' Church officials met Sunday night and made sure all doors and windows were locked, <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON> said. A security guard woke him Monday with news of the fire. The blzae apparently was set by someone who broke into the basement through a window hidden by two evergreen trees beside the three-story, red-brick church, Omak Fire Chief Cal Bowling said. But Bowling said he'd rather not discuss the investigation with reporters. `` Whoever set these fires is going to read your report, and I'd just hate to let him know what this has done to the community,'' Bowling said The latest fire was too hot Monday for the fire marshal to determine what caused it, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. `` We have a strong feeling but we ca n't draw any conclusions yet,'' he said. Authorities hope to determine the cause by Tuesday. But there was no doubt that an arsonist had set the earlier fires, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. The fires are beginning to take a psychological toll on residents and on the 1,800 students, including 450 from North Omak Elementary, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. `` It's having a bad effect on everybody. When the first fire hit the school it devastated the kids. It was tough for them to move. Now they're going to have to again,'' he said. Electricians and plumbers helped set up temporary buildings as classrooms, said <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, who added that nighttime patrols have been expanded with the help of the Okanogan Sheriff's Department. `` It only seems to happen while Omak sleeps,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. `` In a way that's good, because the buildings are empty and, so far, no one has been hurt.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Foursquare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gospel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which also housed <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> students, said he does n't `` want to guess what the arsonist is thinking. `` I think everyone's concerned about saying anything,'' he said. `` You do n't want to motivate the person.''

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who was catapulted to national prominence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in 1984, finished way behind his five <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals Tuesday but vowed to stay the course, saying: `` Today's defeat can become tomorrow's victory.'' `` We're going to take this fight all the way across this nation _ into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, into the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and then we're going to head West, where I live,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told a roomful of supporters. In nearly complete returns, the former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator had 4 percent in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. He put the best face on it. His showing, he said, was `` 500 percent better than <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' where he won barely 1 percent of the vote in last week's caucuses. Four years ago, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> stunned the political establishment by upsetting front-runner <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, gaining status as a credible candidate. He said he never expected to do that well again this year. `` We have just begun. We are committed,'' said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who has labeled himself a maverick, offering fresh thinking. Earlier, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said his faltering campaign had enough money to last until delegate-rich Super Tuesday on March 8. `` I've always mentally prepared for a long-term gain, not a break-through early on,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Campaign manager <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said the candidate had $ 400,000 in his campaign treasury _ enough, she said for three weeks of campaigning prior to the 20 Super Tuesday states. `` I do n't have to do what other candidates have to do,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said during a campaign stop earlier in the day in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` Other candidates have to make a certain showing to get money and get support. We have support in 50 states,'' and money in the bank. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> dropped out of the race last May after questions surfaced about his relationship with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. He returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to re-enter the race in December, soared for a time in the polls, then slumped to the back of the pack.

 Politicians, journalists and schoolchildren commemorated on Tuesday journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s 1,000 th day as a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> But both French and Iranian officials suggested there was no end in sight to the drama. `` It is important that the captors know that all of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is united,'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> said at a gathering of public figures and sympathizers outside a barge on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION>, where the Association of Friends of <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> is headquartered. Twenty-seven runners, ending a 1,000-kilometer trek from <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, arrived Tuesday morning at the barge carrying a large chain to symbolize <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s captivity.

 A victorious <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, flushed with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary win, vowed Tuesday night to `` rise again'' when the presidential campaign moves South. Frequently interrupted by chants of `` We want <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' and `` We're Number One,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of polls that had him slightly behind <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the Republican presidential race. `` Tonight, I feel I have a lot in common with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Reports of my death were greatly exaggerated.'' With 94 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 38 percent to 29 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Others trailed far behind. `` And now I'm going home to change the laundry and on to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where we're going to rise again,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told cheering supporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked the voters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and in a personal note said, `` I'll never forget you.'' `` You have n't chosen a man,'' he said, his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, by his side. `` You've chosen a course, to expand our prosperity, to see that it touches every hamlet, every home ... You've chosen to back a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong enough to bring peace to the entire world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to spend Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then campaign on Thursday in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, two Super Tuesday states. Once the commanding front-runner in polls in the first primary state, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw himself fall into a virtual dead-heat with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s victory in the Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. Beaten 2-1 by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also trailed former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the caucuses. The post-Iowa <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought more contact with voters, making improptu stops at shopping malls, sitting at the wheel of a big truck and a forklift, and declaring that he had strong feelings even if he does n't always show them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> win would wipe out the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> loss. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is the big enchilada in American politics,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. He attributed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s win to the vice president `` talking about issues'' while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` was talking about all this momentum jazz.'' As he prepared to retire for the night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told supporters, `` I leave you with four little words that will be on my mind when I take the oath 11 months from now: Thank you, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Iran-Contra, Bork Hearings Called Constitution in Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official celebration of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution's 200th birthday was largely ceremonial, but historians say the true tribute actually came during the congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra affair and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. The Commission on the Bicentennial of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, the official sponsor of the tribute to the 200-year-old document, got some credit from historians for reaching out to the people with such things as its pocket-size copies of the Constitution. But others faulted it for paying too little attention to serious scholarship. Most of the historians interviewed in recent weeks about the bicentennial celebration agreed that Americans learned more about the Constitution and its workings through watching the Iran-Contra hearings on television and reading about the debate on the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> nomination than through any planned activity. `` My sense is that the commission's work was not particularly substantive,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON>, a constitutional law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who testified to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> against the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> nomination. `` Nonetheless, what the country experienced proved to be extraordinarily profound because of the Iran-Contra hearings and the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> hearings. `` You ca n't help observing how much the public became involved in discussions on the meaning of the Constitution, the role the courts should play, the fundamental relationships between the executive and legislative branches,'' <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said. `` Those topics usually are discussed just by lawyers.'' <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, professor of law and history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> Bicentennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts `` were largely ceremonial.'' `` The ones that have come to my attention basically are on a kind of superficial, ceremonial level,'' he said. In comparison, he said, `` the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> hearings were one of the major contributors _ unconsciously so _ to the constitutional debate.'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodford </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, recalled that when he went to parties last summer and fall, all that people wanted to talk about were the Bork or Iran-Contra hearings. `` This was the Constitution in action,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Both hearings really drove home the fact that the Constitution is not just a document, or a fossil, but something that is enduring.'' Former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who gave up his place on the court to devote full time to heading the <ORGANIZATION> Bicentennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes its work did have an impact on Americans' understanding of the document that guarantees their freedoms `` My guess will be there's a higher awareness, a higher consciousness, not necessarily of the details,'' he said in a recent interview in his office. `` If a free people do n't look from time to time at their liberties and how they got them, they take the risk of losing them. `` Although we succeeded in creating greater awareness, that does n't mean detailed knowledge necessarily,'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> added. A coffee table in Burger's office in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building was covered with recently published books and pamphlets on the Constitution. On it, too, was a cereal box with a short historical message, copies of placemats from fast-food restaurants with short constitutional quizzes and a bicentennial calendar. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>, a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> and president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the historians critical of the commission's work. `` The parades and fireworks have faded into history,'' he said, `` but the commission has failed to give us something that will endure and be of use to future generations.'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> countered that the commission's work will lead to a wider audience for scholarly works and noted that other government agencies have financed studies on the Constitution. The commission stated at the start of its work that it wanted to teach Americans more about the Constitution. It cited a survey that found that about half of the public could not identify the purpose of the Constitution or explain what the Bill of Rights is. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> said no survey of Americans' knowledge of the document has been taken in the wake of last year's tribute, which reached a zenith last Sept. 16 with a party on the Capitol steps in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and with a ceremony in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> the next day. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> <PERSON> Commager </PERSON>, a historian at <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not believe it was possible to measure the success of the bicentennial activities. `` What is the criterion for success for a party?'' he asked. `` If you want to know if people learned anything, who knows? Obviously, the lessons of Watergate did n't teach Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> anything about the Constitution.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the mood of the country for the Constitution's bicentennial was one of introspection `` We were worrying about whether we have dropped the torch, and I think the Iran-Contra hearings and <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> hearings really brought that feeling home. `` This time, we had the Constitution in action,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> added. `` Those hearings brought the Constitution to life.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resumes its struggle toward a national AIDS policy this week with two sharply contrasting Californians at the extremes of disputes over issues ranging from discrimination to testing. On one side is Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, the liberal and influential chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, whose <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> district is ethnically diverse and big-city tolerant. Across the ideological gulf but geographically next door is Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., a conservative from straight-laced and suburban <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Their differences will be aired Friday at what <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> is calling a `` refresher hearing'' on his bill to provide money for voluntary AIDS tests, guarantee confidentiality for those tested, and protect AIDS victims and carriers from discrimination. The hearing follows a series of canceled work sessions last year that <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> claims were scratched because <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> did n't have enough votes to win approval of his bill. `` If he ca n't achieve his objective ... of anti-discrimination status for those with the virus, he will not move a bill in the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> said. `` We had other things pressing on us,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> responded when asked why the sessions were canceled. He said he expects to finish work on the AIDS bill within two months. Though he maintained he is `` always open to discussion,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> indicated he would not compromise on the measure's confidentiality or civil rights provisions and said he detected little support for <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>'s positions. `` The whole public health world has concluded we need to protect against discrimination,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. `` The only people likely to come in for tests if there is no protection are people at low risk'' of having AIDS. <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> calls it `` inappropriate and absurd'' to legislate anti-discrimination safeguards because of what he contends is the `` unstable status'' of information about AIDS transmission. While <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> quotes the prevailing view of virtually all public health authorities that AIDS can not be transmitted by casual contact, <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> asserts that those authorities are rethinking `` their dogmatic pronouncements that the AIDS virus is not a threat in the workplace.'' <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> says employers should be free to decide whether to fire an AIDS victim or carrier. `` The civil rights of the uninfected are entitled to just as much protection as the infected,'' <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> said. He also asserted that protecting AIDS victims from discrimination conflicts with `` the heterosexual ethic.'' Going against the grain of prevailing psychiatric thought, he contended that homosexuals voluntarily choose their sexual preference and said schoolchildren should be taught that `` homosexuality is a perverse lifestyle, it's an unhealthy lifestyle. That's a fact. We should tell that to kids.'' <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> has introduced a bill requiring AIDS testing of marriage license applicants, hospital patients, people being treated for venereal disease and people convicted of drug or sex crimes. He has also sponsored a bill that requires reporting by name of every individual who has AIDS or tests positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> and others who promote such reporting requirements `` seem to want these names for some other purpose'' and that suspicion would discourage high-risk individuals from being tested. `` We have a clear danger of hysterical over-reaction where many people might find themselves persecuted for being infected,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't get sidetracked into an anti-gay crusade when our real job is to stop the spread of this terrible disease.'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said the biggest concern at this point is not the transmission of AIDS among homosexuals but its spread among intravenous drug users `` and their sexual contacts in the underclass.'' <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> contended that strong homosexual lobbies are hobbling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and some state legislatures in their handling of the disease. He said AIDS victims have received kid-glove treatment that flies in the face of traditional ways to halt epidemics. `` If 73 percent of the -LRB- AIDS -RRB- cases were presented by people with gray eyes, a highly disorganized group in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, three years ago we would have witnessed large-scale quarantine of anyone who had the virus,'' he said. <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> also condemned an educational film created by the Gay Men's Health Crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He distributed videotaped copies to reporters and said the film uses tax dollars to promote homosexuality. The tape features blunt language, a demonstration of condom use on a cucumber and a scene of two men kissing in a shower. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said he had not seen the tape but added, `` I would n't know how to design a message to the gay community I do n't think Mr. <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> would know how to design it. ... But we'd better start getting the message across and not pull our punches because we're fearful of talking about sex.''

 The odds are increasing rapidly that Americans traveling abroad can find a fast-food place that bears a familiar name. `` McDonald's in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, Pizza Hut in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> are just three examples of the trend toward expanding foreign markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restaurant fanchises,'' says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. In 1985, there were 6,122 international franchise units, up 36 percent from 3,943 in 1980. Figures by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> show that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> account for almost half, with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> ranking next. The report was written for the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> magazine by two economists, <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Linstrom </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` As you might expect, the popularity of the different restaurants varied around the world,'' the report said. `` For example, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was the largest market for hamburger units, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounted for the greatest share of the chicken market. Austalians and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealanders </LOCATION> enjoyed pizza.'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fried Chicken, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s _ the four largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restaurant chains _ accounted for 31 percent of the world total, franchising 4,626 restaurants internationally by 1986, up from 272 in 1974, the report said. As the largest food service organization in the world with about 9,400 establishments, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> led the international scene with about 2,138 outlets, compared with 370 five years earlier, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, operated more than 6,500 units, including 1,854 in 54 foreign countries. Burger King, part of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foodservice </ORGANIZATION>, operated 4,744 outlets in 1986, including 403 in 24 foreign countries and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s, which grew to the world's fourth-largest restaurant chain in 17 years, operated almost 4,000 outlets, including 231 in 17 foreign countries. Of the four largest franchisers, only <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> operated outlets in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1986, and also held sole position in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries, the report said. `` Franchise growth overseas will continue in existing markets,'' the report said. `` At the same time, some chains are entering previously untapped areas. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> and Pizza Hut, for instance, recently negotiated with the Chinese and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> governments to bring fast food to those countries.'' Most franchise restaurant companies probably will keep expanding their menus and services abroad as well as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, particularly to meet a growing interest in diet and `` light'' foods. `` Strong growth in Mexican and oriental foods may also mean introduction of new menu items,'' the report said. `` Following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trend, breakfast offerings are also likely to increase in overseas restaurants.''

 A shot or two of carbon dioxide _ the stuff used in some fire extinguishers _ may be just the thing to help sensitive plants such as raspberries and blueberries survive the stress of heat therapy, says an Agriculture Department plant pathologist. The result one day could be a new assortment of plants for nurseries and home gardeners. Heat is used in special chambers to rid fruit and vegetable plants of viruses. At 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the heat forces the plants to grow faster than the viruses lurking in them, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Converse </PERSON>, who works for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION>, Ore. But that's too hot for blueberries and many raspberries, he said in a recent report by the agency. If carbon dioxide is raised to 1,100 parts per million in the chamber from the 350 parts normally present in the air, the plants are able to withstand the heat. <PERSON> Converse </PERSON> said the process of raising carbon dioxide levels had been used previously by Australian scientists to heat-treat grape plants. He is hopeful that the procedure can be used to eliminate viruses from apples, oranges, potatoes, onions and bulb crops such as iris and lilies.

 Poultry processors soon will be allowed more options in repackaging and relabeling federally inspected fowl and poultry products for final distribution to consumer outlets, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. As it is right now, poultry products can only be repacked and relabeled at federally inspected plants. `` Warehouses and distribution centers are often more conveniently located than federally inspected plants,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` So, allowing certain facilities to repackage and relabel poultry products with inspectors present means savings in time and money and a safe product. We believe the savings in transportation costs could ultimately mean lower prices for consumers.'' The optional operations will also have to be done under the supervision of federal inspectors, he said. The new rule will take effect on March 11. The processors will pay <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for the inspection at the repackaging operations. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the optional service has been available to the meat industry but has not been allowed under poultry inspection regulations. Repacking and relabeling allow bulk shipments of federally inspected products to be divided into consumer packages and to have brand names placed on the products.

<HEAD>Homosexual Congressman Raises Funds While GOP Looks For A

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who acknowledged last year that he is a homosexual, is busy raising money for his re-election campaign while the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is still looking for someone to oppose him. At this point, the only <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> publicly talking of running against the liberal <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat is a conservative gadfly who withdrew from the 1986 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> gubernatorial race after admitting he had lied about his military record. `` I do n't know what the Republicans plan to do about it, but the reading we have -LRB- from polling -RRB- is that voters care about performance in office'' and not personal issues like sexual preference, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` And that's certainly consistent with the reading I've gotten from people.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrats say the homosexual disclosure will have little impact on voters who have sent <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with increasingly convincing victory margins _ 52 percent, 60 percent, 74 percent and 89 percent. And they note that the disclosure was not news to many constituents. Republicans, however, are talking about how <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> could be defeated in the state's 4th District, which includes Democratic strongholds on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, upper-class Republican enclaves like <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, and mill towns like <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, said the homosexual issue could be exploited by a Republican challenger, not by attacking <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s sexual preference but by telling voters he is focusing too heavily on `` gay issues'' at the expense of other congressional work. `` I've always thought it's a case of how the congressman votes, and if his sexuality slants his voting in such a way that he no longer represents his district,'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. `` In many cases he has chosen to pursue issues that have an effect on the gay community to the detriment of issues that affect the typical constituent in his district,'' he added. However, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> could not immediately provide any examples. And <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s supporters point to his work on several major bills in 1987 to counter that argument. They credit him with playing major roles in passage of a measure requiring that any low-income federal housing demolished under urban renewal be replaced; a bill requiring a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate alleged wrongdoing by administration figures; and legislation prohibiting the government from denying visas based on politics. While Republicans talk about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s vulnerability, there is no declared candidate with the election nine months away. The only politician publicly considering a challenge to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is <PERSON> Royall </PERSON> <PERSON> Switzler </PERSON>, who would carry considerable political baggage into any race. <PERSON> Switzler </PERSON> made a name for himself by taking on leaders of the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ often alone _ during his years in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> GOP enlisted <PERSON> Switzler </PERSON> in 1986 to run against popular Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but he was forced to bow out after admitting he was a sergeant in peacetime <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, not a Green Beret captain in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 47, is taking nothing for granted. Campaign reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> show that his spending and fund-raising in 1987 were more than double his campaign receipts and expenditures during 1985, the last non-election year. The fourth-term congressman raised $ 144,300 during 1987, compared to $ 71,400 in 1985. He spent $ 106,400 last year compared to $ 49,800 in 1985. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> also paid $ 7,000 for an October poll to measure voter reaction to the disclosure of his homosexuality. `` The general finding is that overwhelmingly people in the district will judge me on how I do my job as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not anything else,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said.

 Planners of the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Presidential Library, forced to abandon a site at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after widespread protests, are running into skepticism from some city officials about their proposal to build the library near this <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> city. The 100-acre site, donated by the real estate development firm of <PERSON> Blakeley-Swartz </PERSON>, impinges on a greenbelt area that is protected from large-scale development by a decade-old, non-binding agreement among <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>. `` We do not want the library project used as means for further land-use concessions on any property within the greenbelt,'' <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION> officials wrote on Jan. 7 to the <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the project. Moorpark Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said similar letters were sent by officials of Thousand Oaks and <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, a partner in the developing firm, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` We have seen the letter and I think we can live within the scope of that.'' But <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a mathematics teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Moorpark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are concerned as a council that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> library may be used as a lever to get additional land development.'' However, he added that he thinks the $ 60 million library could be `` consistent with the greenbelt if that is the only anticipated use.'' <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> expressed surprise at a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that <PERSON> Blakeley-Swartz </PERSON> plans to build a 300-room hotel and conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library site. `` We are going to have real concerns about that,'' the <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION> mayor said. <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> said only about 40 acres of the Blakeley-Swartz property lie within the greenbelt. Nevertheless, previous efforts to develop the property have been rebuffed by local officials who argued such development would affect the integrity of the greenbelt agreement. The strongest concerns have been expressed by <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION>, which officials say would be most affected by development of the property because of its location. `` I think in general people are very supportive of the library,'' said <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> `` One of the reasons the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> liked the area was that it was so unspoiled, so development would be contradictory to the president's wishes. To a certain extent, that will help maintain it as a greenbelt.'' The greenbelt, covering about 1,200 acres, embraces an area of rolling hills covered with brush, beavertail cactus and wildflowers. The heights command a sweeping view of surrounding valleys, and on a clear day <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s offshore <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> can be seen in the distance. Although surrounded by more development, the site is in itself much like the country around the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' ranch, about 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where the president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are taking a brief vacation. Selection of the site climaxed a search which began after the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> abandoned the Stanford location in the face of opposition from students, faculty and homeowners. Reasons for the opposition ranged from politics to traffic. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was driven to the new site during a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation in August and approved it. The president gave his approval after flying over, planners said. The foundation has not yet filed a plan with <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials for development of the site, but has said it hopes to start construction in July. Local officials say they will be concerned if roads and other facilities for the library would support additional development. `` This is the first time that we have had the prospect of quite such a prestigious proposal,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Simi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>. `` This is n't something that comes along every day. So I'm assuming that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> foundation indeed is serious `` Now what I do n't know, if they have a fairly intense land-use plan, is whether or not they are going to get the go-ahead from <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. That may be discouraging.''

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had just finished a strident anti-communist sermon to the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> stood up and told the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate what was on his mind. `` I'm shaking,'' he said. `` I'm sitting here really afraid when you start talk about going to war.'' It was a dramatic moment on the eve of the crucial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, where <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> hoped for another surprising finish in the wake of his upstart second-place showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. After several minutes of back-and-forth, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>: `` I do n't know what else to say except that peace will come through strength. ... Maybe would you prefer to live under communism? I do n't know. I'd rather be free.'' The confrontation with the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> merchant highlighted the strong reaction some have to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s foreign policy positions. It also came as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopeful was embroiled in a controversy about Soviet missiles and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said during a Sunday night debate that Soviet medium-range missiles are still based on the island, although he backed off the assertion Monday, saying he had no such first-hand knowledge. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> drew criticism from his opponents for the comment, in tones that echoed <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' fears. `` This is a very serious allegation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview on a <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, radio station. `` You keep hearing these outrageous charges ... which are designed to scare the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> called it `` a rather rash and unsupportable charge.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said SS-4 and SS-5 missile sites established in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1962 `` were confirmed as having been destroyed in that year.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> candidate forum, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> gave his standard speech, with a strong defense of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and strong denunciations of communism as the greatest evil the nation faces. After hearing what <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had to say, this was <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' reaction: `` He advocates using weapons and war as a solution to all the problems in the world ... That's is n't a solution _ that's annihilation. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> talked of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, calling it an abomination that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> should have stopped. `` Had I been president when that was done, there would have been <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks on the move to knock that thing down,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. And that was too much for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who runs an office furniture store. `` I'm sitting here really afraid when you start talk about going to war the way you just talked about it, the result of taking tanks to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` With all that talk of war, not understanding the threat we face today from nuclear weapons ... We can no longer do it.'' Part of the audience of 250 applauded <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> asked who he supports and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> nodded and went on to compare the current situation to the challenge posed by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the 1930s. `` Had we been resolute in the face of dictatorship that would never have happened. I am for peace with all of my heart,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> broke in: `` There were not nuclear weapons when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was there. You need to address the root cause before it comes up to a <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, not afterward with weapons.'' The former television evangelist was clearly irritated by <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' questions but pressed on `` You have somebody who is every bit as bad as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in charge of many nations of the world,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` Communism is just as bad as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. ... If we want to have peace in our world, it is absolutely essential that we stand up resolutely to communism.'' Several times later during the appearance, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> to address his concerns. At one point, he said: `` This gentleman had all the concerns. Sir, I want to eliminate nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.''

<HEAD>Robertson Backpedals On Cuban Missile Assertion, Saying No One
Really Knows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says he has no first-hand evidence that there are Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, as he had claimed in a debate over the weekend with his Republican presidential rivals. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> came under fire Monday for the assertion, made Sunday, which fellow <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates termed `` rash'' and `` outrageous.'' The White House emphatically denied the claim and the man identified by the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign as the candidate's source said the existence of such weapons in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has not been confirmed. The former television evangelist initially said Monday that he would not `` back off'' his claim. But later in the day, he began revising it until he was saying that he had been asking a question, not making an assertion, when he alleged that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has nuclear weapons pointed at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I was asking in the debate is this true,'' he said. `` I have no sources other than what I've said, so there was no categorial statement per se.'' In the debate, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was attacking the intermediate-range missile treaty signed last December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when he made the claim. `` Somehow in all this brilliant negotiations which these gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty,'' he said. `` And it seems to me nukes pointing at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are more vital to our security than nukes pointing to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Pressed by reporters here, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he had no first-hand evidence that there are such weapons in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` My contention is there might be missiles in the caves; they may have brought in missiles on some other transport vessel or possibly a submarine. I do n't know the exact sizing of it, but nobody can say for certain that those missiles are n't there,'' he said. Later, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Larry King Live,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said it is possible there are Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think, frankly, there's anybody in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> right now that I'm aware of who can say categorically that there are or they're not there,'' he said. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had told a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate's forum here that `` the least we can do in this is get those nuclear weapons out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' a reiteration of the statements he had made during Sunday's debate in <LOCATION> Goffstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> `` I'm not going to back off from that. I'd be happy to have somebody prove me wrong,'' he told an interviewer. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said SS-4 and SS-5 missile sites established in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1962 `` were confirmed as having been destroyed in that year. We also are confident that the missiles were removed from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at that time. `` We have had extensive intelligence collection directed at <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since 1962 and have no evidence that SS-4, SS-5 or other strategic missiles have been deployed there,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Asked whether he was denying any offensive nuclear weapons are deployed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Exactly.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview Monday that `` I'm confident this -LRB- <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> assertion -RRB- is not true,'' and added: `` You keep hearing these outrageous charges ... which are designed to scare the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Another GOP presidential candidate, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called it `` a rather rash and unsupportable charge.''

<HEAD>Dole Backers Denounce Puerto Rico GOP Straw Poll As Illegal; Bush
Wins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are claiming an overwhelming victory in a Republican straw poll, but <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s backers boycotted the vote and say they'll win when it counts _ on primary election day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> garnered 731 votes while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> got 32 in the presidential straw poll, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters denounced as illegal. `` This proves that <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> country,'' said <PERSON> Josito </PERSON> <PERSON> Dapena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign director for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supporters minimized the importance of the poll _ which is not binding _ saying the real test is March 20, when <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> holds its primary. `` We do n't participate in straw polls,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a pro-Dole observer at the assembly. There was a bitter dispute when <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committeeman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aldarondo </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> backer, tried to address the gathering to question whether there was a quorum. He was told he had not registered as a delegate and could not speak. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, the local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the presence of 750 of the 1,500 delegates in the general assembly would constitute a quorum. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supporters said there were only 682 delegates registered but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces said more than 900 attended. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers had `` failed ... in an attempt to convene and illegally poll Puerto Rico Republicans.'' Monday's assembly was originally scheduled to chose the 14 delegates to the Republican convention instead of waiting for March 20. However, the local <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> went to court to prevent the primary from being advanced. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> results would give the vice president a lift going into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and also `` send a positive signal to other Hispanic voters throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Last week the political spotlight was on a farm state whose economy has fared poorly during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. Now it turns to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> state that has been booming. Political analysts say economic circumstances may have a bigger impact on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary than any momentum from the Feb. 8 caucuses in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> came in first, with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> falling back to third place behind <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side. `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was a state that voted for change,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` The status quo candidates were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and they both did fairly or very poorly. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle did n't sell in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is `` at the other extreme, with the lowest unemployment rate in the country and a boom economy. The status quo is much more popular.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said exit polling in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> showed, `` the more dissatisfied you were with the way things were going, the more you voted for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> or <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> on the Republican side _ if you were realy unhappy, you voted for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> _ and for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on the Democratic side.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a Republican analyst, agreed that <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was `` a considerable portrait of discontent.'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s screaming one-fifth of the vote was the only vote that you could really read as support of the president. That's pretty low for an incumbent vice president,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` On the Democratic side, it's pretty clear that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did better than early expectations. The guy who ran a little bit behind early expectations was Mr. New England Good News, the man with the purring economy whose message is for the yuppies, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, `` what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has to worry about is falling short of expectations,'' like <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> in 1972, he added. <PERSON> Stu </PERSON> <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON>, a top policy adviser in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, predicted that the combined <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> results may only show the strength of regional candidates _ Midwesterners <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englander </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dukakis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the two Democrats with the strongest Southern ties, emerge as the big winners on Super Tuesday, then the Democrats may be `` left with no one candidate showing a national base and strength.'' `` We'll have sorted out regional candidates with no base anywhere,'' <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reactor Building Roof Fractured by Malfunctioning Fan, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The roof of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Power Supply System No. 2 nuclear reactor building cracked because of a malfunctioning fan, but the mishap posed no danger, officials said Monday night. During a safety check of a circuit breaker Sunday night, an air supply fan came on inadvertently and within a few minutes had built enough pressure to pop about 200 bolts that fasten an interlocking grid of steel panels in the roof of the building, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxsen </PERSON>, operations director. The bolts are about a quarter-inch in diameter and an inch long, he said. No loud noise accompanied the fracture, and it was discovered only as a reactor operator noticed the bolts on the floor while making a routine hourly inspection less than an hour later, <PERSON> Oxsen </PERSON> said. The pressure pushed the roof upward a few inches, and when it fell back into place there were two seams in a rough T-shape, one seam about 40 feet long and the other about 25 feet long, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified immediately, but there was no danger to workers or the public, Ms. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said. The plant was shut down at the time. <PERSON> Oxsen </PERSON> said repairs could cost more than $ 1 million, `` a couple of hundred thousand dollars a day -LRB- for -RRB- up to a week.'' `` These -LRB- roof -RRB- panels, I should add, are designed to do exactly what they did,'' he said. `` These bolts are designed to pop'' when internal pressure reaches a specified level. He explained that the pressure system and roof design are intended to protect the reactor from inward collapse in the event of a tornado or other severe storm. He said an initial inspection indicated the only repairs needed would be to bolt the panels back into place and restore the foam, tar and gravel on top of the roof, which is about 120 feet off the ground. `` The whole building is pressurized,'' he said. <PERSON> Oxsen </PERSON> said similar accidents had occurred at other reactors, including the <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> about 19 or 20 years ago. He said he did not know the cost of repairs in that or other instances. The plant at the nearby <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation was shut down Saturday to fix leaks in two condenser tubes in the cooling system, so `` it was an opportune time to do some other maintenance,'' <PERSON> Oxsen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> had directed <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> to check for potential problems in some <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> circuit breakers, including the one linked to the errant supply fan, he said. Both exhaust fans and the other supply fan were turned off at the time, he said. <PERSON> Oxsen </PERSON> said the control panel initially failed to show the supply fan had come on, and an automatic cutoff system apparently failed as well.

<HEAD>Palestinian Wounded In Jerusalem; Leaflets Call For `Day of Wrath'</HEAD>

 Riot police battled Arabs in violent clashes in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and leaflets distributed in the occupied territories called on residents to step up protests and attack Jewish settlements in a `` day of wrath.'' The leaflets, which appeared Monday, also asked Arabs to hold commercial strikes and stay home from their jobs today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media said. In another development, the army on Monday questioned an Arab youth who said he and three other residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> were buried alive by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers using a bulldozer after a riot Feb. 5. `` I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' said the youth, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishtiah </PERSON>, 19. `` I dream about it all the time.'' Relatives charge that 20 soldiers grabbed the four Palestinians after the riot, beat them, forced them to lie on the ground and then poured sand over them with a bulldozer. The four were unconcious when relatives rescued them after several minutes, according to villagers quoted in Israeli newspapers. Two soldiers have been detained in the case, and further detentions were expected, the army said. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s army commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, who ordered the investigation, said that `` even in my worst dreams I would never imagine such a thing.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on Monday attacked left-wing legislators who said soldiers had the right to refuse to obey orders they considered illegal. `` There is nothing more dangerous to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> than soldiers deciding what is bad and what is good, which orders to accept and which orders to reject,'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying. In interviews with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media, a number of soldiers have said they were troubled by orders to use beatings instead of bullets to quell Arab protests. In a related development, the Hadashot newspaper on Monday said three soldiers of the elite <PERSON> Golani </PERSON> brigade were sentenced to jail terms of at least 21 days for using excessive force against Palestinians. The army said it had no information on the case. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets in several locations Monday to disperse stone-throwing Arabs. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said police did not use live ammunition, but a border police officer told photographers that forces fired gunshots to subdue protesters in the <LOCATION> Anata </LOCATION> neighborhood. Officals at <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said they treated a 23-year-old resident of the city's <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION> refugee camp for gunshot wounds to the abdomen. The Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the man was shot during a clash at <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION>. It was the first report of bloodshed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bahir </LOCATION> neighborhood, border police fired tear gas to disperse Palestinians who erected roadblocks of twisted metal and burning tires. Residents said border police broke into homes. They showed reporters smashed windows, an overturned television set and the shattered glass panels of a china cabinet. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 21 Arabs were arrested in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Monday, bringing to 437 the number of demonstrators detained in the holy city since Dec. 8. During that period, 54 Arabs have been killed by Israelis in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, members of the Gush Emunim settlement movement said they were printing flyers to be distributed in Arab areas. The leaflets contain threats that if the protests continue, Arabs might be ousted from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. In the political arena, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on Monday called on his political rival, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, to work out a joint Israeli reaction to the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. `` It does n't look so good that when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> envoys come here, it appears there are two governments,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` With the arrival of -LRB- Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, despite our differences of opinion, we need to sit together,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is expected to visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> later this month to seek support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. The proposal calls for an international opening in April to launch direct talks on an interim solution for the occupied territories. Negotiations of a final settlement would begin in December, regardless of the outcome of the interim talks. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has accepted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes key elements as well as statements by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must be ready to trade land for peace.

 Midnight voters in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch gave Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> the winning votes in the nation's 1988 leadoff presidential primary. More often than not, Dixville's votes have been a bellwether for candidates seeking the presidential nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received 11 votes, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 4. In the rest of the Republican field, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 6, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 5, <ORGANIZATION> Pete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> 2, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> 2, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 1. Among Democrats, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> received 3. No other Democrats received votes. `` In the primary, Dixville has a pretty good record in choosing the eventual candidates for each party,'' Town Clerk <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON> said of past elections. `` It's just when we came to November, we'd frequently be in the wrong party. Since 1960, Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser in all but three presidential elections. They picked the winners in 1972, when they favored <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, and in 1980 and 1984, when they sided with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Few residents of the resort town in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> were willing to discuss in advance how they might cast their ballots. `` Because so many people are asking, the voters tend to not be committal, even amongst themselves,'' said <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>, a supporter of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, came up with the idea in 1960 of making Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state to cast ballots. Now 89 and the town moderator, the elder <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON> _ who owns The <LOCATION> Balsams </LOCATION> resort hotel where the votes are cast and a surgical glove factory that is the town's only industry _ incorporated Dixville Notch that year to push the village into the national spotlight. Every four years, most of the candidates or their surrogates make their way five hours north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to Dixville Notch, population 47, to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south of the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> border. They are followed by more reporters, photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town. Residents take seriously their place in political history. They make sure to be in their voting booths by 11:45 p.m. so they can drop their ballots into the ballot box at the stroke of midnight.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> is probably his best friend, and he'd like to do another movie with the blue-eyed actor. `` He's the greatest,'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` Not much I would n't do for him.''

He looks great, feels great, has lots of money, gives to great causes, he's in love with his wife, he races his cars when he wants to, makes a movie when he wants to, he's incredibly happy and still has that face that looks the way it did when he was 20. `` God, by the time we got home, I wanted to shoot myself.'' `` I'd love to make one more movie with him,'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> added. `` Just one more.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forecast a win but Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also expressed optimism Monday as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential field sprinted for the finish line in a tight <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary race. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his expected win might be smaller than predicted. `` I sense a rising tide,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president threw all the resources he could muster into his bid to arrest <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s week-long surge, campaigning side by side and in a hurriedly taped television commercial with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, patron saint of conservatives `` It feels good, like it did in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last Monday,'' countered <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, hoping to ride to victory on the strength of the momentum spawned by last week's caucus win. One candidate after another posted hopeful predictions of a surprise when <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> voters render their verdict in the nation's lead-off primary on Tuesday. `` I do n't know where all those political pundits are today but they ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run for cover tomorrow,'' said former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, back in the pack in the GOP race. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidacy on the line, held out the hope of a second-place finish that would confound the pollsters. `` I'm going to finish in a good competitive third or higher,'' he said Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, also facing tough times if he falters, said he was sure he'd defeat Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for second place. Referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' commanding lead in the polls, he said, `` I think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.'' Fellow Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, far off the pace in the polls, said, `` I'm anticipating a strong showing and a surprise but I ca n't put a number on it.'' Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> bid to deal with a tempest that arose over his claim that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has offensive nulcear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration denied the claim, but the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopeful said, `` The least we can do is remove those nuclear missiles.'' Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead seemed secure, to judge by the polls, but he and his aides worried that they would be held to an impossible standard when the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> results are analyzed. Thus, he noted that his rivals have been attacking him regularly, adding, `` I assume that's going to take its toll.'' No two polls were alike. But they all showed a Republican race as close as the Democratic campaign was not. First results from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, as usual, came from the mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch, where midnight voters favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who claimed 11 and 4 votes respectively. In the rest of the Republican field, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 6, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 5, du Pont 2, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> 2, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 1. The only Democrat besides <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to get any votes was <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who received 3. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor in next-door <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, held a commanding lead among the Democrats with support of roughly 40 percent of the voters. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished a close one-two in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses last week, are in a duel for second place <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are far afield in the polls. Among the Republicans, the surveys said that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has wiped out all of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once-commanding lead in the eight days since the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and the vice president slipped to third place behind <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and former du Pont are in a close fight for third place in the same surveys. What the polls could n't say was whether <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s momentum would carry him past a struggling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to first place. The vice president had his re-tooled, informal campaign style on display. He went from one restaurant to another to greet voters at breakfast time, ordering pancakes at one stop, sipping coffee at a second and eating an Egg McMuffin during a visit to a McDonald's. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s call for a spending freeze as a `` copout'' that avoids making tough decisions, and forecast a victory for himself in the lead-off primary. `` I'm going to win tomorrow. Believe me,'' he told a cheering crowd at <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> <PERSON> Colleger </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>. In the five-minute television commercial, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the `` best qualified candidate of my lifetime _ other than me, <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' Addressing the voters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Who can you most trust to continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution?'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his senior aides sounded confident. `` I think it's that close,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who said a victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> might carry him all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. `` I'm always skeptical until the polls close,'' he said, but then added that he had followed his pollster's example and `` slept well last night.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said that no matter what the outcome, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a loser in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't have a campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility,'' he said. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bid to salvage <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> already was looking beyond. As for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's claim to have a `` firewall of support'' in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next month, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said, `` It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager maintained that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> surge had stalled. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a little behind but he's moving up,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s voters `` to assert their independence'' from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` There is a difference between me and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a difference in experience, a difference in commitment,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a speech prepared taking aim at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, but he chose not to deliver it when he faced a high school audience in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>. `` This campaign is not about the past, it is about creating a future in which all of you can work,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> made no attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the final full day of campaigning. `` Stand with me tomorrow and we will reform <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 New Hampshire primary voters put their often unpredictable mark on the 1988 presidential campaign today, with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hoping for a neighborly boost from the Democrats. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> hoped to make it two victories in a row while <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> banked on a comeback. In keeping with longstanding tradition, the 34 voters of Dixville Notch cast their ballots shortly after midnight at the Balsams, a resort hotel, and gave the edge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. Statewide, about 150,000 Republicans and 115,000 Democrats were expected to vote, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, secretary of state. `` It feels good, like it did in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last Monday,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, referring to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus victory that catapulted him to the forefront of the race. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who suffered a jolting setback in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, predicted he'd bounce back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> `` I sense a rising tide,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took some comfort from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s tradition of rejecting <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> winners _ including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1980, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984. All the candidates _ seven Democrats and five Republicans _ sounded upbeat about their prospects. Optimism was bipartisan. `` I hope we are going to do a good deal better than people are expecting,'' said Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who was dead last in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> after pulling his campaign out of the state last year. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who finished ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was in a tight battle for third place in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary with Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know where all those political pundits are today but they ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run for cover tomorrow,'' said du Pont. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> insisted he, too, would fool the pollsters. `` I'm going to finish in a good competitive third or higher,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> hinted he might equal his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> showing and come in second. The former television evangelist's finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was far stronger than the polls had indicated, so no one was willing to predict how large his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> following might be. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was trying to distance himself from statements made in a debate Sunday night, when he said there were <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. That drew a quick denial from the White House and criticism from the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> field. He initially stuck by the statement on Monday, but under questioning, acknowledged he had no first-hand evidence that there were nuclear missiles on the island. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said he was sure he'd defeat <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman, for second place And referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' commanding lead in the polls, he said, `` I think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.'' As it has since 1960, the mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch was the first to report results. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received 11 votes, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had six, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> five, du Pont two, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> two, and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> one. The town's seven Democratic voters gave <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> four votes and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> three. `` I do n't think it makes any difference if you're the first vote or the last. It's the vote that counts _ the privilege,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>, 89, town moderator and the community's patriarch, who traditionally casts the first ballot just after midnight. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the Democratic winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> finished second and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> third in the caucuses there. But statewide results in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> were likely to be different. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the overwhelming favorite with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> battling for second. Opinion polls consistently gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the support of between 36 and 40 percent of Democrats. Polls of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> showed a dramatic impact of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> results. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, once the choice of 52 percent of the state's Republicans, entered primary day in a virtual dead heat with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Six candidates appeared at the <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> on Monday for a `` Rally Finale'' and a chance to pick up support among the thousands of holiday shoppers. From a platform set up between a shoe store and a jewelery shop, Republicans <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delivered abbreviated versions of their stock stump speeches. Leadership was a campaign theme sounded in both <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, particularly in the struggle between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. But the foreign policy debate on the Republican side featured more hawkish rhetoric in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> than in dovish <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who rarely mentioned Star Wars in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, made a strong plea in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for development and deployment of the missile defense system. Candidates in both parties also emphasized their fealty to low taxes, an article of political faith in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who brought in a corps of congressmen to campaign for him on the weekend, trumpeted the endorsement of former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in a television commercial Monday. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the 1964 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee and a hero to conservatives, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the `` best qualified candidate of my lifetime _ other than me ...''

<HEAD>Labor Leaders Assured That Layoff-Notice Bill Is On Track</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Congressional leaders have assured the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> that its top legislative priority, a trade bill with mandatory advance notices of plant closings or mass layoffs, soon will be sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise that is to emerge probably will not include the strict trade imbalance-reducing quotas written into the House version by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., says <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive council here Monday he had won assurances from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and other key negotiators that the House-Senate compromise version will be `` nailed down'' by March 23 and on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for final action the following week. After slightly different versions won easy passage in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year, the trade measure became a dead letter when the stock market crashed Oct. 19 because of fears it would trigger more panic selling by stock and bond traders. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said last month that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto either version as it now stands as being too protectionist. The main targets of the administration's opposition have been the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> language in the House version and a milder variation of it along with the mandatory 60-day advance layoff notices in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure. `` No question in my mind, we'll pass a trade bill ... with enough votes to override a veto, should that be necessary,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. He said he met last week with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trade representative, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, expressing a willingness to compromise and promising them a vote by the end of the year on a separate U.S.-Canada free trade agreement wanted by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the trade bill require countries with free access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets to provide the same level of access to American exports. If a country does not remove its tariffs or quotas on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, the president would have to impose the same measures on their exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or justify why he would not do so. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said some version of the mandatory advance layoff notices will be in the final package despite intense opposition from business groups. But he indicated the bill likely will drop the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> language, complaining there is too much of a `` fixation'' on it. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s measure, a major theme of his presidential campaign, would mandate retaliatory quotas or tariffs on some countries if they do not reduce their trade imbalances with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 10 percent a year over a five-year period. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign message of threatening Koreans with stiff <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs was credited with reviving his campaign with a victory in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. Labor leaders said the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> results confirmed their belief that the nation's record trade deficits and their contribution to the loss of more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs this decade is a _ if not the _ dominant political issue. `` The public will begin to demand more strongly that something effective be done about this decline of the American industrial base,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Monday. `` Everything is going down with it.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> agreed, saying wage scales in many countries with the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalances `` are so far below those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that they are acutally depressing wage scales and the standard of living in our country.'' Nonetheless, he predicted the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees will agree on `` something in between'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s language and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, which targets raising exports to countries with large trade surpluses rather than mandating specific trade imbalance reductions.

 Authorities cut telephone lines of leading Lithuanian nationalists and warned citizens of the Soviet republic that protests marking <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s short-lived independence would not be tolerated. On Monday, 2,000 people attended an officially-staged rally in central <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> to protest alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> affairs. Most participants kept their hands in their pockets and chatted with neighbors during the hourlong rally, then disappeared down the narrow streets of the republic's capital. Uniformed and plainclothes police flooded a main street, cemetery and square where dissidents planned demonstrations today, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s declaration of independence. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents said nationalists planned to lay wreaths today at such sites in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, the republic's second largest city and the spiritual center of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic church. Lithuanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladislavis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikuciauskas </PERSON> was asked by foreign journalists Monday if people could mark the independence day. `` Personally, yes. But it is forbidden to organize anything,'' he said. The Moscow-based correspondents, barred from traveling to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on their own, came to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> on a tour organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. In 1940, the Soviets took over the three Baltic states _ <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> _ under a secret non-aggression pact that <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed the previous year. The states had a stormy independence between the world wars, variously occupied by the Germans, Poles and Russians. About 80 percent of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s 3.6 million people are of Lithuanian descent, the highest percentage of native population of any of the Baltic republics. Lithuanian nationalist <PERSON> Nijole </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON> said Communist authorities had distributed a warning in offices and factories that taking part in protests today would be considered an `` anti-Soviet act.'' The crackdown marked a hardening of the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s line on protests by nationalist groups. Officials allowed peaceful demonstrations in the Baltic states on Aug. 23, the anniversary of the non-aggression pact. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never recognized the incorporation of the Baltic states by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians still speak out in support of Baltic nationalists. During Monday's official rally, one elderly man said <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> factory and office workers had been forced to attend the rally. The man refused to give his name, saying he feared arrest. `` They just drove them in,'' he said. `` It's that simple.'' Another participant said each <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> workplace had been told to provide 10 people for the rally held next to the city's former Roman Catholic cathedral, which now houses an art gallery. Ms. <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON>, 49, who served three years in a labor camp and three more in internal exile for her role in publishing underground Catholic literature, said her apartment was under <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> guard and that her phone was disconnected without explanation Sunday. `` They shut it off at 10 a.m. without giving me notice,'' she said, speaking to The Associated Press from her office. Ms. <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON> said the home phones of other <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activists including former political prisoner <PERSON> Povilas </PERSON> <PERSON> Peceliunas </PERSON> also were disconnected. She said more than 100,000 Lithuanians attended services Sunday at <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>' 17 functioning <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches and left singing traditional national songs. In <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, she said hundreds of people visited the grave of a national poet, and an undetermined number were beaten by police. When Latvians tried to celebrate their national day on Nov. 18, police and vigilantes were deployed to keep demonstrators from approaching national monuments. Estonian nationalists plan to mark the anniversary of their declaration of independence on Feb. 24.

<HEAD>MIT Study Identifies Weaknesses In American Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Poor management, an inability to cooperate, and a preoccupation with short-term profits are among reasons American business is losing ground to foreign competitors, says the first report of the <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Industrial Productivity. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is still the most productive in the world, but could be surpassed by other nations that are gaining on it, the commission reported Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. `` We are talking about keeping the standard of living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and enhancing it,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the commission. `` In that sense, we think productivity is important.'' The commission was appointed in December 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Its 18 <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> scientists, engineers, political scientists and economists _ including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Solow </PERSON>, last year's winner of the Nobel Prize in economics _ were asked to determine the causes of the weakness in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity and to make recommendations to industry, universities and government concerning what might be done to correct it In its interim report Monday, the commission listed what it believes to be the five principal causes of the decline in American productivity. They are: _ Excessive attention to activities and investments that are profitable in the short run. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> invented the transistor radio, color television and the video cassette recorder, <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> said. American businesses quickly lost interest in producing them, however, and lost those markets to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. _ Parochial attitudes that led <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses to pay insufficient attention to foreign competitors. In the machine-tool industry, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms tried to backlog orders rather than aggressively deliver products on time. Japanese firms promised quicker delivery and captured much of the market, <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> said. _ A lack of cooperation within firms, among competing firms and between firms and their suppliers. One reason that Japanese automakers can bring new cars to market faster than those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is that Japanese designers and production engineers work together more closely than their American counterparts, <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> said. `` That's endemic to our educational system,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON>, a commission member and the dean of the <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` We throw you out of school if you cooperate on an exam _ it's called cheating.'' _ Weaknesses in human resource management. `` The worker is viewed as a cost factor to be minimized, rather than as an evolving human resource that has to be educated, motivated,'' <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> said. _ Failures in applying technology to make simple, reliable, high-quality products. In the case of VCRs, the Americans who invented them could n't develop production lines that would meet the close tolerances necessary and would do so at an acceptable cost, <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> clings to certain practices that might have served us in the past, when our economy was far ahead of everyone else's, but are not serving us well now. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the easiest country in the world to hire and fire people,'' he said. It is the only industrialized country where people can be fired at will, he said. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, to take one other example, workers must be given one year's notice before they are dropped, <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON> said. While the ability to fire workers might seem efficient in the short-term, it provides powerful incentive for workers to sabotage innovative technology that might cost them their jobs, <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Solow </PERSON> said that the comparatively high cost of borrowing money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, makes it more difficult for American firms to profit from long-term investments.

<TEXT>
 Citizens of the tiny resort town of Dixville Notch today gave Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> the first bragging rights in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s 1988 leadoff presidential primary. In the town's traditional balloting at midnight, the vice president received 11 votes, beating his closest <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who received six. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> received five votes, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> two each, and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> one. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> received four votes and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> three. Twenty-nine of the town's voters cast their ballots in flag-draped, individual voting booths, while five votes were cast by absentee ballot. Other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> residents had to wait until their polls opened beginning at 6 a.m. `` I do n't think it makes any difference if you're the first vote or the last. It's the vote that counts _ the privilege,'' said Town Moderator <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>, 89, who cast the first vote in keeping with tradition. And frequently, Dixville Notch voters have been on target. `` In the primary, Dixville has a pretty good record in choosing the eventual candidates for each party,'' said <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, the town clerk. `` It's just when we came to November, we'd frequently be in the wrong party. In the presidential primaries since 1964, Dixville's voters have picked winners eight times, a loser once and had two ties. But in the November presidential elections during the same period, Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser on all but three occasions. They picked the winners in 1972, when they favored <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, and in 1980 and 1984, when they sided with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The elder <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON> came up with the idea in 1960 of making Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state to cast ballots. <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>, who owns The Balsams resort hotel where the votes are cast and a surgical glove factory that is the town's only industry, incorporated Dixville Notch that year to push the village into the national spotlight. Every four years, most of the candidates or their surrogates make their way five hours north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to Dixville Notch, population 47, to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south of the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> border. They are followed by more reporters, photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town. Residents take seriously their place in political history. They make sure to be in their voting booths by 11:45 p.m. so they can drop their ballots into the ballot box precisely at midnight. `` I think it is an honor to be the first in the nation to vote. And I think people in <LOCATION> Dixville </LOCATION> take it very seriously,'' said 14-year resident <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Barba </PERSON>, a registered independent who favored Republican <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` We realize there is pressure on us ... and we do n't just pick somebody we do n't know anything about. We study the candidates more and we make a decision based on that.''

 As a political science major, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON> knew the job description including the fine print. Still, he never thought it would come to this. `` It is most definitely not the sort of task I had in mind when I ran for office,'' he said the other day, reflecting on what has become Topic A across <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> among residents and visitors alike: the impeachment of the governor. `` And I'm sure,'' he said, `` that I speak for my colleagues, of both parties.'' <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON> is one of the 30 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> state senators who soon, sitting as a jury, will decide whether to restore <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is now in political limbo, impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> 46-14 and his gubernatorial duties assumed by the secretary of state. The next step is a trial in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where a conviction would require a two-thirds vote. The trial is scheduled to start Feb. 22. Judging the fitness of a governor to remain in office seems to be like cleaning the gutters. No matter how ardent the outcry that it be done, there is no joy in doing it. Stop any senator in the Capitol corridors these days and you hear phrases like `` awesome responsibility'' and `` no-win situation.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, won the office with less than 40 percent of a light turnout in a three-way election. `` It is safe to say,'' says <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, also a Republican, `` that to the vast majority of Arizonans he is the worst governor this state has ever seen. `` He has polarized the state. Instead of practicing the art of the possible, the art of compromise, of bringing people together, he has brought a narrow, ideological and personal agenda and is trying to shove it down people's throats. Anyone who opposes him on any basis instantly becomes an enemy. `` Even so,'' says <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, `` to invalidate a constitutionally held election is the most sobering act any of us could ever contemplate.'' <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, 35, has made politics a career. Unlike nearly all other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> he has no other job. He makes no bones about planning to run for governor himself some day. He represents <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, one of the state's two urban centers, where his constituents are about evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. `` However I vote in the impeachment trial, yea or nay _ and I wo n't make up my mind until it's time _ I will not please many of my constituents. This is true of all of us to a greater or lesser degree depending on the makeup of the constituency. `` But that's good. It will make it easier for us to put aside any public or political pressures and make our decision solely on the facts as we see them.'' Another senator, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON>, feels equally free of political pressure but for exactly opposite reasons. She represents one of the most remote areas in the state. Her home is <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION>, a town of 8,000, the largest in the three counties she represents. She is part owner of the town drug store and served as mayor without any party affiliation. When the Republican senator who represented the district for 30 years retired last year her neighbors voted for her to take his place. She did, as a Republican. She says her constituents are predominately Mormons. She is not. Mormons, who number about 200,000 in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, are divided on the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> issue but nonetheless represent a great deal of his support. `` I came here to represent rural people who do n't have a lot of representation in an urban-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said, `` but I have absolutely no political ambitions beyond doing that duty as best I can. `` So I feel comfortable about casting a vote because I feel I can make a fair decision. If it happens that my constituents do n't like it and do n't choose to send me back, so be it. <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, for his part, expects the vote to be close. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, he points out, faces a criminal trial for not reporting a campaign loan as well as a May 17 recall election resulting from a public petition. `` Even if some senators feel he is guilty of an impeachable offense they could vote against it as an attack on the fairness of the process. Why not use one of these other avenues?'' Well, why not? `` Because the people have a right to expect a standard of behavior in their public officials that does not have as its bottom line simply acting lawfully. `` That's why the constitution provides for impeachment. It is a political process, not a judicial one. A court trial could be long and drawn out; if there is a conviction there would be appeals. `` There is no short-term way that these matters can be resolved, but they must be resolved so we can restore some stability to this state. `` That's why I'm prepared to do a duty that is extremely onerous to do.''

 The mother of a 3-week-old infant who received a heart transplant says doctors have given her son a 10 percent chance of survival. `` He's in very critical condition. The transplant did n't go as well as we had anticipated,'' <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>, 20, said late Monday. `` They do n't quite know yet what went wrong. They do n't know if it was a heart attack or stroke. It -LRB- the heart -RRB- just got tired out,'' she said. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> underwent more than 10 hours of surgery Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. He is the youngest patient to undergo a heart transplant at Children's, she said. Because the new heart is in a weakened state, doctors have placed him on a special support system, Miss <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. The device takes over the pumping function of the heart, allowing it to rest. `` We hope -LRB- it -RRB- works,'' she said. `` If it does n't, he could be in all kinds of trouble.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>, 20, of <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Falls </PERSON>, said he hopes the new heart is `` just tired and will get stronger on its own.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> was born Jan. 25 at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, weighing 7.9 pounds. Doctors soon became worried over the failure of his tissues to receive enough oxygen. He was transferred to Children's two days later, where doctors found he had hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a lethal underdevelopment of the heart. Another infant who received a new heart because of the same ailment improved to serious condition Monday, 24 hours after his transplant surgery, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said.

 Thousands of <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> revelers thronged the French Quarter today for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest block party, where madness is a way of life and the only sin is to be a party pooper. <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>, or Fat Tuesday, was the crescendo of two weeks of nightly pre-Lenten Carnival parades in The City That Care Forgot. As early as noon Monday, the lines were a half block long outside <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s bar, a popular watering hole in the Quarter, and the non-stop party was just getting started. Narrow streets of the city's old section were wall to wall with revelers. As the party grew, jazz and fireworks heralded the arrival of a costumed stand-in for <PERSON> Rex </PERSON>, the King of <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>, who disembarked from a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter at the Riverwalk shopping mall on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> just outside the Quarter. By midnight, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and his friend <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Granda </PERSON>, both from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, were getting into the swing of things at <ORGANIZATION> Molly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pub </ORGANIZATION>, a crowded bar on the Quarter's river edge. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said it was his 15th <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>. `` This has always been my second home,'' he said. `` Last year was great, and we're hoping good weather will make this one just as good. If it is, I'll need five days to sleep when I get back to St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>.'' The first of 17 organizations scheduled to take to the streets today was jazz clarinetist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Half </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, preceding the real <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> along a route winding past the stately homes of the Garden District to <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in the central business district on the edge of the Quarter. In the Quarter, women on wrought-iron balconies often bare their breasts, and gay bars play host to male cross-dressers barely clad in various combinations of women's underwear, hosiery, high heels, feathered headresses and beaded gowns. Today's crowds could surpass the estimated 1 million people that jammed metropolitan area streets last year, said police spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. The day officially concludes at midnight tonight with the meetings of the courts of <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> and Comus, signaling that <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> has given way to Ash Wednesday and 40 days of Lenten sacrifice. Last year, police were criticized for clearing the streets after <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> with a little too much vigor. Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> said officers will be more gentle this year, but no less insistent. In nine days preceding the 1988 celebration, police had made 1,434 arrests, 79 fewer than last year, a police spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Mamou </LOCATION>, 160 miles west in the heart of Cajun country, <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> is celebrated, but in a different way. As many as 20,000 visitors were expected to turn out in the town of 3,200 for Courir du Mardi Gras, or The Running of the <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION>, in which masked horsemen canter from house to house soliciting the makings of a giant gumbo. At dinner time, those still in the saddle gallop into town to toss their gleanings into the pot. The Cajun country towns of <LOCATION> Eunice </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawtell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ville </PERSON> <PERSON> Platte </PERSON> also celebrate Courir du <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> Mamou </ORGANIZATION>'s celebration is the biggest.

<HEAD>Nicaraguans Complain That Reforms Are Aggravating Inflation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A union leader and people in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> complained that the government's new attempt to combat runaway inflation through currency and economic reforms has sent consumer prices soaring. On Monday, the government began trading one new cordoba for 1,000 old ones and raised salaries up to seven times their December level. It also increased prices and ended government subsidies for a host of staples _ ranging from rice to beans, milk, sugar and cooking oil. Last year, inflation reached at least 1,500 percent. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced the reforms in a broadcast address Sunday, declaring that 10 new cordobas would buy one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. `` The new measures enforced by the government has left us in an even worse state than we were before,'' said <PERSON> Nilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, general secretary of a 30,000 - member federation of construction unions Nicaraguans have until Wednesday to exchange up to 10 million old cordobas at 2,000 booths the government has set up across the nation. Bank deposits are being adjusted automatically. Under the reform package, the government-subsidized price of gasoline jumped fivefold overnight to 15 new cordobas a gallon. Gasoline is rationed at 17 gallons a month for private automobiles. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said people in his federation say they are worse off than before. As an example, he cited an assistant bricklayer whose monthly salary has risen from 191,808 old cordobas to 792.50 new ones. `` A liter of milk which yesterday cost 2,500 old cordobas now costs 6.60 new cordobas, or 6,600 old cordobas. That is to say these prices have gone up more than 60 percent,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. The leftist Sandinista government has said the new measures will benefit wage earners in the long run by reducing inflation. The revaluation is also an attempt to do away with the black market, where a dollar had until Monday been worth up to 60,000 cordobas. On the official market used to import machinery, petroleum and other essential goods, a dollar had cost 70 cordobas, while it was worth 21,000 cordobas on the parallel market. A pound of beef, which used to cost 25,000 cordobas, now costs 35 cordobas. `` That means that an assistant bricklayer has to work 10.93 hours to buy one pound of meat,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. An urban bus ride _ which the government wo n't subsidize anymore _ will now cost half a new cordoba, against 10 old cordobas. `` They -LRB- those in the government -RRB- think they can deceive people?'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnonel </PERSON>, a 26-year-old carpenter, asked as he waited in line Monday outside a bank to change his old cordobas for new ones. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, 40, a mechanic, complained that a `` housemaid will not be able to buy anything with the 500-cordobas -LRB- a month -RRB- minimum salary that she gets paid, when a pound of beef costs 35 cordobas, a dozen eggs 25 cordobas,'' and bread from 7 to 10 cordobas a pound. Many of shopkeepers closed their doors Monday to adjust their prices and to change old cordobas for new ones. But at <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s huge Oriental Market _ a center of black market dealing in foreign currency _ it was business as usual. Black market dealers and stallkeepers accepted both old and new cordobas. Three days were allowed for the exchange, during which only newspapers, fuel, medicine and medical services could be purchased with the old bills. In addition, the government established a temporary radio service to provide information on the currency exchange. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has blamed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic problems on the 6-year-old war with U.S.-supported Contra rebels and an American trade embargo. According to the government, the two factors have cost <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> $ 3.8 billion in lost income.

The dollar closed at 130.50 yen, down 0.50 yen from Monday's close of 131.00 It opened at 130.40 yen and ranged between 130.10 and 130.60 yen. `` Many traders decided to sell dollars when it hit the 130-yen level,'' said an official at a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> commercial bank. `` There was also profit-taking, which resulted in the dollar's decline.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 225.53-point winner Monday, added another 138.19 points, or 0.57 percent, to close at 24,345.66. `` The market is recovering from the October crash. We expect the stock average to hit the 25,000-point level during February and March,'' said an official at a major securities firm who spoke on condition of anonymity. Distribution issues such as supermarkets and department stores were popular. Foods and textiles, along with drugs and chemicals, were also higher. Among the losers were electricals and machineries. Volume was a heavy 680 million shares, up from 650 million shares Monday. The securities firm official said improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seasonal trade figures continued to help boost share prices, reflecting hopes for a shrinking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. Both the dollar and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock prices have surged following the announcement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for December last Friday, showing the deficit fell to $ 12.2 billion from $ 13.2 billion in November. The dollar rose 1.05 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Monday. Some investors on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were focusing on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s January trade performance, traders said. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the nation's unadjusted trade surplus for January was $ 3.07 billion, down from $ 4.31 billion a year earlier. Other investors were concerned about the dollar's effect on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s seasonally adjusted January trade surplus, which rose to $ 7.76 billion from $ 6.36 billion in December.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> continued to improve four days after surgery to correct an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to his brain, a hospital spokeswoman said.

Doctors have limited <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s visitors to family members only, Ms. <PERSON> Nutt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, have three children. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had been complaining for several weeks about neck pain he thought to be a pinched nerve. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> was admitted to the hospital early Friday after being transferred from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, where he lives. He underwent eight hours of surgery, which did not involve removal of any brain tissue. The 3-term senator withdrew from the Democratic presidential race last September following disclosures that he had borrowed, without attribution, portions of campaign speeches from a British politician and that he had exaggerated his academic accomplishments.

<TEXT>
 Police said no explosive device was found in a car that burst into flames early today a few yards from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s official <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> residence and office, killing the driver. Police bomb squad officers raced to 10 Downing Street around 1 a.m. local time fearing a possible terrorist attack. However, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard later said in a statement: `` There was no trace of an explosive device.'' It added: `` At no time did the car make any attempt to enter Downing Street and therefore the prime minister was not in any danger.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office issued a statement confirming that the prime minister had been at 10 Downing Street at the time of the incident. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said police did not yet know what caused the green <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viva </ORGANIZATION> automobile to burst into flames at the entrance to Downing Street from <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, the main thoroughfare in the area. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said gasoline cans were believed to have been found inside the car and that one theory was that the driver deliberately started the fire in order to commit suicide. But <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard refused to comment on that report. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said police had not yet established the dead man's identity It said an autopsy will be carried out on the badly burned body. `` We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident,'' it said, indicating that police do not believe the fire was the result of crime. `` A car pulled up in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> at the entrance to Downing Street and burst into flames. The fire was put out by <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> and the body of a man was found inside the car,'' the <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard statement said. The incident was witnessed by a police officer on duty at the metal security barriers that separate Downing Street from <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>. The car had been traveling down <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> from the direction of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> was sealed off for about three hours as police investigated the burned-out auto before removing it.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Attack on Supertanker Off Iran</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today claimed its warplanes hit a supertanker in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> after raiding Iranian troops along the war front. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes attacked `` a very large maritime target,'' a common reference to a supertanker, off the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> coast overnight. It did not give the exact time of the raid. The agency quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying: `` The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force will continue to destroy naval targets that ferry Iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance the aggression against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' The news agency quoted a military communique as saying that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets flew 60 combat missions earlier Monday along the war front, `` inflicting substantial losses in men, weaponry and equipment, then returned safely to base.'' It said Iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed Iranian military posts in 39 sorties, destroying `` many of the enemy's troop buildups and positions. It gave no details. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not comment on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims. However, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its outnumbered air force jets attacked a petrochemical complex and military installations in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Monday. A communique issued in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranian warplanes `` heavily bombarded <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> positions and fortifications'' along the southern front east of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> farther south. Iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in one of five raids carried out by early Monday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` All the attacking fighters returned safely to bases after inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy,'' it said. Reports by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which have been at war since 1980, can not be independently verified because they rarely allow access to combat zones. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air force is outnumbered 8-to-1 by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s fleet of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> - and French-made aircraft However, in recent weeks <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used its U.S.-made planes in several raids, suggesting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> may have bought spare parts on the black market. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 60-70 operational warplanes, according to Western military analysts.

 Less than a week after deciding to permit closed meetings during the trial of impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to scrap the idea. Senators also decided Monday to reconsider whether to begin the trial Feb. 22 as scheduled or agree to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s request and delay it until after his criminal trial. Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> urged his fellow senators Monday to change rules adopted Thursday that would allow them to hold closed discussions at the request of only one senator. `` Even though it was never the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to hide from the public, or to railroad or exonerate the governor in private, the press has intimated that this type of situation would not only be possible but probable behind closed doors,'' <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> said. In a formal motion filed later Monday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorneys also asked for open discussions. `` Absent a compelling reason, the principals of fundamental fairness dictates that every moment of these impeachment proceedings, the importance and gravity of which can not be overstated, be witnessed by the citizens of this state and nation,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> wrote. `` Surreptitious meetings held in smoke-filled back rooms will cast a dark cloud of suspicion over the hearings,'' he added, calling it `` nothing but a farce, sham, and a mockery'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to meet secretly. A two-thirds vote is required to change the rules. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Soldwedel </PERSON>, praised <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>'s appeal. `` We would like all of the proceedings to be in public,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has filed a similar request. Usdane, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> and Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, urged that all deliberations be in public and that closed meetings either be banned entirely or at least require a majority vote. `` This will allow the public to know the senators who voted for a closed conference,'' he said. <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> also said he might boycott closed meetings if the changes are not adopted. Several rank-and-file Republicans said they favored a change, and <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he believed his caucus also would be willing to go along with changes. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, lending $ 80,000 to his car dealership from the governor's protocol fund and obstructing justice. The Republican governor has said repeatedly that he is innocent of all wrongdoing. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a criminal indictment over the $ 350,000 loan and a May 17 recall election precipitated by a petition drive.

<HEAD>Waldheim Refuses To Step Down; Denounces `Slanders'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> dismissed a rising chorus of calls for his resignation by saying he would `` not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations.'' In a nationally televised speech on Monday, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said his conscience was clear about his wartime conduct, and he appealed for the trust of `` you, my dear Austrians'' and for national unity. But by reiterating his refusal to quit in the 14-minute speech, the president appeared certain to deepen divisions in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> caused by a report by a panel of international historians on his wartime past. In the 202-page report issued last week, the six historians questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral integrity, saying he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing to stop them. Though the panel said it found no evidence <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had committed war crimes, it concluded he tried to cover up his involvement in World War II, which was disclosed nearly two years ago during the presidential campaign. The government appointed the panel at <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s request after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put him on a list of undesirable aliens, which effectively forbids him to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walheim </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, admitted in Monday's speech that he might have erred in not discussing his past as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> from 1942 to 1945 But he insisted he had never tried to conceal it and had `` a clear conscience.'' Without giving specifics, he told <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s 7.5 million citizen that `` parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are built on presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions drawn can not be upheld.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, appealed both to World War II compatriots and those too young to know `` the horrors of this war'' to judge for themselves whether `` your president is ... the distorted picture of this officer of the Wehrmacht _ or ... a man who for decades of his life worked for justice, tolerance and peace.'' He said resigning would be against the wishes of those who elected him. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said a `` convincing majority'' had elected him to a six-year term in June 1986 and added, `` A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> won 53.6 percent of the vote in a runoff. Calls for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation, including street demonstrations, have increased since the report was issued. In an 80-minute interview for <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program broadcast early today, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said his military service in <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army was a common experience for Austrians. `` If one pretends that I was lying because I did not give all the details of my military career right from the beginning, this is not something that I can accept,'' he said. Serving in the German army was `` the normal fate of a young Austrian of let's say 20, 22 years of age. To make him responsible for the wrongdoings of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>, which I condemned, this in not fair.'' Socialist politicians, who opposed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s election as titular head of state, were swift to condemn the speech. But the president's conservative backers in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lauded the performance. The two parties have governed in an increasingly fractious coalition since national elections in November 1986 left neither with a clear majority. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> called the speech `` a great disappointment'' and indicated the country could do without <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> as president. The Socialists have stopped short of calling outright for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation. On Sunday, however, Socialist Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said that he might resign if too much of his time is consumed by the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> affair. <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s deputy chancellor and head of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s speech was `` brutally open'' and maintained that the fuss would soon die down But Economics Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, another leading conservative, said in a radio interview that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` must take a decision which is very important for our country.'' In a radio interview several hours before the president spoke, <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> said he was concerned about <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s tainted image and praised the comments <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> made Sunday.

 A federal jury turned down a wrongful death suit filed by the widow of former <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> football player <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> against the city of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and three police officers. `` We were disappointed. Very, very disappointed,'' <PERSON> Cynequa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who had sought $ 1.8 million in damages, said after the verdict Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s lawsuit claimed police officers had violated her civil and constitutional rights, as well as those of her late husband and the couple's 4-year-old daughter, when they fatally shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> during a struggle over a gun on Sept. 12, 1983. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hailey </PERSON>, said he would decide within a week whether an appeal would be filed. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> claimed her husband was mentally impaired when he was shot. Her lawsuit alleged negligence on the part of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> police officers <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratcliff </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in closing arguments Sunday that the three officers `` did only what they had to, not what they wanted to do.'' In his instructions to the jury, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinder </PERSON> said they were to balance the plaintiff's claim that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s rights were violated by the excessive use of force with the defendant's contention that using deadly force was reasonable because the officers had cause to believe <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> posed a threat to their safety and lives. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was from <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Three Parents Arrested In Protest Over Transferred Teacher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 15 parents and community activists seized an elementary school classroom to protest the transfer of a teacher, and three parents were arrested in a demonstration one protester called a `` great civics lesson.'' Parents blocked the door to a room at <ORGANIZATION> Brentano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Monday while the third-grade teacher and about 30 students were inside. They refused to let the new teacher enter to show `` that sometimes you have to stand up against those kind of policies that hurt people,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickley </PERSON>, one of the protesters. After a six-hour impasse, the three parents were arrested and charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor, before they were released on their own recognizance, said police officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. The other parents dispersed. `` They could go to jail up to a year for it. It is one thing to protest _ it is another thing to deter the operation of a school,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. The transferred teacher, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON>, had taught the children since the beginning of the school year but was not yet certified, she said. School officials considered her a substitute teacher. When a teacher at another school received certification, the two were directed to switch classrooms as of Monday. But Ms. <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON> showed up Monday in her old classroom to protest. Ms. <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON>, 40, said she hopes the protest will persuade the school board to put her back in her classroom, but she realizes it may jeopardize her future as a teacher in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s schools. Ms. <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON> was told she was being transferred Thursday after school was over, and since Friday was a school holiday, she said had no chance to say goodbye to her pupils. `` Children become very attached with a teacher, so it is very traumatic for them. It's very traumatic for me too,'' Ms. <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday night. The protesters met Monday night and decided to start picketing in front of the school this morning, Ms. <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON> said. A teacher `` is not something to be ripped away from them without a chance to say goodbye,'' said <PERSON> Rickley </PERSON>, whose three children attend another school. Most of the students who were in the room when it was seized about 9 a.m. Monday were removed and assigned to other classrooms after police arrived an hour later, said <PERSON> Aracelis </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, a district superintendent for the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Students Rally In Support of University Building Takeover</HEAD>

 Hundreds of students rallied in the rain outside a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> building to support its occupation by black students protesting campus racism. Many of the estimated 200 students held lighted candles and sang during the rally Monday night outside the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Earlier in the evening, the dozens of students occupying the building evacuated it after a telephoned bomb threat, said protester spokesman <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. They returned about 10 minutes later when campus police found no bomb, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. The students said they planned to present a revised list of demands to Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> this afternoon, but refused to provide details. Classes scheduled for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> House today were to be held in other buildings because the university does not plan to evict the students and because several faculty members refused to teach there during the protest, said university spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>. `` We see this as a short-term temporary thing. We do n't want to escalate tensions,'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said, adding that officials hoped a resolution to the dispute could be reached following the meeting between <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and the students. The occupiers began getting support from white students Monday as students began trickling back to campus after a long holiday weekend. Several returning students said they had left before the building was taken over Friday, and had been unaware of the protest. Between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the weekend, said <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the protesters. `` The number fluctuates as people come and go, but at least 60 have remained in the building at all times,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. When asked how protesters were spending their time, he responded, `` We're studying. We're students. `` We've set aside the third floor of the building as a study hall and some of the graduate students with us, who are teaching assistants, are working with students,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The students had been scheduled to meet Monday with <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, but the session was canceled because he left campus to visit an ill brother. After becoming aware of the illness, the protesters sent <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> a sympathy card signed by more than 200 students. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> responded by sending them a fruit basket and a card reading, `` I send affection and respect.'' The takeover was sparked by the alleged beating last weekend of two black students by six whites following a dormitory party. A group of graduate students Monday were organizing an effort to have white students and faculty wear black armbands in support of the protest. `` It's a symbolic gesture, but the racism on campus has gone on for too long and is far too prevelant,'' said graduate student <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tripoli </PERSON>. `` It's time to begin putting an end to it.'' Among the initial demands presented to university officials last week was that five white students allegedly involved in the weekend beating be suspended. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> refused to discuss specifics of the revised demands until <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> had a chance to review them. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the thrust of the demands remained unchanged, but that the students had revised the wording to make them more acceptable to administrators. About 9 percent of the 25,000 students at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' largest public university are minorities. There are 641 blacks enrolled and about 500 are undergraduates, <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. Total undergraduate enrollment is about 19,000 students.

 About 1,300 Chinese students returned home last year after completing studies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, leaving 27,000 Chinese at American universities and colleges. The official <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily today said 8,817 scholars have returned from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began sending students abroad in 1979. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s overseas study program has become a matter of controversy because of the large number of students who are refusing to come home, opting instead for the better jobs and living conditions they find abroad. Some of those who have returned have had difficulty finding suitable work and readjusting to the rigid political and social norms of their native country. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government last year announced regulations tightening controls over students going abroad and requiring they be `` ideologically and morally sound.'' However, officials stress that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is still committed to sending students overseas to learn skills needed in the nation's modernization drive.

 Police say they have interviewed about a dozen people but have made no arrests in connection with fires that have charred schools and churches and forced children in this town into makeshift classrooms. Six fires have been set in the past three months, starting in early December, when one of the town's two elementary schools was torched twice within eight days, authorities said. Two churches, which opened their doors as temporary classrooms for <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students, and a church parsonage have been set afire during the last two weeks. The latest blaze destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Omak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> early Monday. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sustained about $ 200,000 in damage and another fire set there Saturday caused $ 30,000 in damage, said <ORGANIZATION> Omak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>. Another blaze hit the Methodist parsonage next door on Sunday, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. Omak Fire Chief Cal Bowling said the latest church fire apparently was set by an intruder who broke into a basement window flanked by evergreen trees. Fire, police and sheriff's investigators met behind closed doors Monday to chart investigative and security plans. A $ 7,500 arson information reward fund was set up under the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Police Chief <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirois </PERSON> said police had interviewed about a dozen people, and among them were two of three `` persons of interest.'' Investigators also were seeking to talk to four or five more, <PERSON> Sirois </PERSON> said. He said two of them no longer live in the area but frequently return for visits. He said investigators have `` limited phsyical evidence'' and the next step is `` just a lot of hard work,'' including stepped-up surveillance. Pastor <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, who lives across the street from the Presbyterian church, said a roving custodian-security guard woke him early Monday to alert him to the fire. `` It's got everybody on the edge,'' he said. `` They're nervous ... waiting to see what's going to happen next.'' Added <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, managing editor of the weekly Omak Chronicle: `` It's affected everyone in town. People are very, very grim.'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said there was no doubt that an arsonist was behind the fires in December and January that destroyed the elementary school. Arson also was the cause of the blazes at the Methodist church, he said. `` They're a kook ... someone who is unbalanced,'' said <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, superintendent of Omak's school district. He said school officials have checked their records for any former employee or student who might have a grudge, but have turned up nothing. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said the city's eight-person police force is making every effort to catch the arsonist, whose work is beginning to take a psychological toll on the town's 4,000 residents and its 1,800 students, including 450 from North Omak Elementary. `` When the first fire hit the school it devastated the kids. It was tough for them to move. Now they're going to have to again,'' he said. Counselors and volunteers were helping children and parents cope with the fires, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. The town has purchased trailers that will be used as temporary classrooms, he added.

<HEAD>Pakistan Urges Moscow To Rejoin Talks on Afghan Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> today called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to rejoin efforts at finding a formula for a future Afghan government, rather than pulling troops out of that country unconditionally. The <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Foreign Ministry gave a statement to reporters saying that only by linking its proposed withdrawal to an agreement on an interim <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government could <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> assure an end to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s nine-year civil war. `` The withdrawal of its forces must be accompanied with arrangements to ensure peace and stability inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Otherwise, the tragedy of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ... will continue,'' the statement said. A ministry spokesman, who can not be named under news conference rules, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has changed its position on a so-called twin-track approach to reaching a U.N.-sponsored accord on ending the Soviet's eight-year role in the war. Kremlin leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> issued a statement Feb. 8 setting a pullout date of May 15 provided that indirect talks between the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> governments produce an accord at least 60 days before that. However, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also stated for the first time that a pullout would not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a transitional Afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout. This, according to Pakistani officials, means that fighting between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s governing communists and the Afghan guerrillas could continue, preventing the return of 3.5 million Afghan refugees who reside in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The spokesman also claimed that the absence of a political accord would make it impossible for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to abide by a key element of a peace agreement already accepted by <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: an end to foreign military aid to Afghan guerrillas. `` If the refugees continue to camp just miles from this very porous border -LRB- with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -RRB-, it will be impossible for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to guarantee -LRB- foreign -RRB- non-interference,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> governments, who have negotiated indirectly at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, have agreed on the principles of non-interference, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future status as a non-aligned country and the voluntary return of nearly 5 million refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. At the next round of talks, scheduled for March 2, they are to concentrate on the details of a withdrawal of Soviet troops. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would serve as guarantors of an accord, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives substantial military aid to the Afghan guerrillas. An agreement at the next <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> round, predicted by <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> and the Pakistanis alike, would ostensibly mark the end of the Soviet army's involvement in the conflict. The Moslem insurgency in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> began in 1978, before the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in December 1979, ostensibly at the request of the Moscow-backed Afghan communist regime and under the auspices of a Friendship Treaty. Western analysts estimate 115,000 Soviet troops are now fighting Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the Marxist government.

 Inspectors for the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> could shut down unsafe plants and construction sites under a major overhaul of the nation's primary job safety law advocated by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. Although no such legislation is under consideration now, the executive council of the 14.3-million member labor federation said Monday it wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to change the 17-year-old <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> law once a new president is elected. `` The act's penalty structure and criminal provisions must be strengthened,'' the 36-member council of union leaders said in a statement. `` Those provisions are badly out of date and fall far short of those provided in more recent safety and health laws, such as the Mine Safety and Health Act.'' Inspectors for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s sister agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, now have the authority to shut down any unsafe mine on the spot. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors lack that power except in rare circumstances, and even then they must first obtain a court order. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> measure also would expand coverage under the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> law to include workers in the nuclear and transportation industries and some 14 million employees of state and local governments. All of them are exempt now. In addition, it would mandate safety and health committees with union or other worker representation at each job site. The committees would have the right to conduct their own inspections, review an employer's hazard control measures and direct a shutdown of a dangerous job site on their own, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON>, the federation's deputy director for safety and health. The initial reaction by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials attending the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s annual winter meeting here was positive. But Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON> said any consideration of amending the law would first require a major policy review within the department. That kind of action is not even in the planning during the last year of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, he said Business groups also want the law changed, but in a different way. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has called for legislation that would mandate cost-benefit analyses now being practiced as policy under by adminstration before <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> can issue new or toughen existing health and safety regulations. The chamber also wants to prohibit <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> from `` interference'' in issues that it says more appropriately belong under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, such as responding to every worker complaint with a plant inspection, as now required by the law.

<HEAD>Opinions Differ On Baby Boomers' Role In Presidential Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's baby boomers are poised for the first time to swing a presidential election, according to a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> research fellow. `` There's a good chance the baby boom vote could play a key role this year,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyte </PERSON>, a research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Humphrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boyte </PERSON> said a candidate who shows concern about the economy, job security, home ownership and the future of children can win baby boomer votes. He said, however, that would require tapping an `` underlying social concern'' among older baby boomers who fought for civil righs and women's issues and awakening a political interest in younger baby boomers who have generally shunned activism. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a private pollster in the Twin Cities, says `` there's a coalition out there waiting to be mobilized'' but that none of the presidential candidates is doing it. But some political analysts say it ca n't be done because the baby boomers are too varied to fit under one political banner.

 When harbor pilot <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> fell into <PERSON> Winyah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, he became the fifth person to disappear in the bay on Feb. 13 in the past 11 years. `` I do n't think I'll go fishing on Feb. 13 next year,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, whose father and cousin drowned in the bay on Feb. 13, 1982. `` It is a little unusual because the day my father disappeared out there the winds were coming from the northwest and it was cold. These were the same conditions when Mr. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> went out.'' `` I've heard people call that area in <LOCATION> Winyah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> the Devil's Triangle,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Goude </PERSON>, who helped search for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s father and cousin as a volunteer with the <ORGANIZATION> Winyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skinner </ORGANIZATION>, a second generation harbor boat pilot, had piloted the freighter Tropical Sky out of <LOCATION> Winyah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and was returning to the trailing pilot boat when he apparently fell from a ladder leading down to the awaiting boat He landed in the mid-40-degree water at 3:30 a.m. Saturday. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has not been found. Volunteers searched the area for four hours Monday until foul weather forced them to stop. `` We will continue to search until the family says they want us to stop,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Winyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has discontinued its search until further developments, a spokesman said. On Feb. 13, 1977, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> went to search for a friend in their 10-foot outboard.

The bodies of <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> were found later in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>. On Feb. 13, 1982, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> Sr. and his nephew <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> left port in their 18-foot boat to go shad fishing.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Thin Trading, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against all major currencies except the Japanese yen in quiet European trading this morning. Gold prices fell slightly in thin trading. Foreign exchange dealers said they expected little activity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets opened following Monday's one-day holiday for Presidents' Day. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, many traders stayed home because of carnival festivities. Turnover was extremely low and most banks and businesses in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> were preparing to close early today. `` We are waiting for the Americans to come in, but by that time, we are already out,'' said one dealer at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank. A trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said the dollar might pick up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later today in reaction to Monday's report of a narrowing in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus to $ 3.072 billion in January from $ 8.601 billion in December. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.50 yen to a closing 130.50 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly lower at 130.40 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's rates: _ 1.7145 West German marks, up from 1.7085 _ 1.4060 Swiss francs, up from 1.4040 _ 5.7880 French francs, up from 5.7705 _ 1.9265 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9180 _ 1,261.50 Italian lire, up from 1,257.50 _ 1.27275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2658 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound It cost $ 1.7385 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7455 late Monday. Bullion dealers said gold was drifting aimlessly, largely because so many markets throughout the world are shut, depriving <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> of any direction. In addition to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> being shut on Monday, many European centers are closed or half-staffed for carnival and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is closed for the Chinese New Year. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 444.25 a troy ounce and at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed the same recommended price. It was down from Monday's late bid of $ 445.10. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 444.75, down from $ 445.50 late Monday. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.35 a troy ounce, unchanged from Monday's late bid.

<TEXT>
 Three birth control organizations serving <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> have won a temporary reprieve from new federal rules barring federally funded family planning clinics from advising pregnant women on abortion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> granted a preliminary injunction Monday against the new rules, scheduled to go into effect March 3, sought by Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> -RRB- Women's Health Clinic She said the order applies only to the three plaintiffs' clinics. `` The order just says the government can not put these regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a final hearing,'' <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> said in an interview. The judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a week. She said two similar cases will be heard in federal courts in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suit claims the new regulations violate the Title X statute and the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, censure free speech rights at family planning clinics and violate the right of privacy of clinics and their patients. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> ruled that family planning programs receiving federal funds may not provide pregnant women with information on abortion or refer them to other sources, even if they ask. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have said the rule is intended to make sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion, even indirectly. <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of trying to use the regulations to circumvent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and amend legislation that set up Title X of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Act in 1970 to provide family planning clinics. `` Legislative history includes a groundswell of support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for women's rights to abortion even three years before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision'' legalizing abortion in 1974, she said. She said the new regulations represented a `` 180-degree switch'' from past interpretations of the statute by previous administrations. <PERSON> Weinshienk </PERSON> said she based her decision on many <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings that barred rules that `` dictated to doctors what they say to patients, which is what the regulations attempted to do.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> today threatened to attack Israeli targets around the world to avenge the killing of three guerrilla commanders and the bombing of a ferry being readied for a protest voyage by Palestinian deportees. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the slayings on Sunday and the explosion aboard the Sol Phryne ferry on Monday. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> knows that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is not handcuffed ... The blood of our martyrs will not go unavenged,'' said a statement issued in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officers _ Col. <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayyali </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON> _ were killed in a car bombing in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' southern coast, apparently after arranging the sale of the Cypriot ship to a PLO-affiliated firm for the so-called `` Ship of Return'' voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We had adhered to the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Declaration to halt military operations against enemy targets outside the borders of our country -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the statement said. `` It is not logical or possible for the halt to continue unilaterally. This is a double-edged weapon,'' it added. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> declared during a visit to the Egyptian capital of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> in 1985 that his guerrillas would restrict their attacks in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict to targets inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and halt terrorist attacks on Israelis abroad _ a policy the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had pursued since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> took over its leadership in 1969. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said today: `` There are alternatives. We are not desperate,'' when asked what the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> planned to do after the explosion that crippled the Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not say whether the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has found another boat to charter for the 130 deportees and hundreds of sympathizers and reporters who planned to go on the voyage to protest the deportation of Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had tried to launch the voyage from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, but it was repeatedly delayed, reportedly under Israeli pressure. The deportees, sympathizers and reporters were taken in buses to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport Monday and were told they would be flown to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to board the boat. After news of the blast reached <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, most returned to their hotels. Another <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> had disclosed that the 40-year-old ferry, which was sold Saturday only a few days before it was to be auctioned, had a hole blown in it by `` an underwater blast caused by a mine that was stuck, probably by frogmen, onto the vessel. It was attached to a time fuse.'' The boat was supposed to sail to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters. The planned voyage resembles in some ways the 1947 trip of the Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman who has been overseeing preparations for the voyage, said on Monday: `` We are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite of Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, noble ideas.'' <PERSON> Fouad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Bittar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> diplomatic representative in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, said: `` The damage -LRB- to the ferry -RRB- is not very severe.'' But the ship's captain, <PERSON> Cleanthis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlahopoulos </PERSON>, said it would take `` several months'' to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again. A man claiming to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said the U.S.-based extremist group was responsible for the device that planted the 6,151-ton Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>. `` The JDL is responsible for the bombing at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it.'' The man made the claim in a telephone call to The Associated Press, but there was no way to authenticate it or verify the caller's identity. He said `` no comment'' when asked if the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> also was behind the car bombing that killed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials Snday. The <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> advocates use of violence in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. It was founded in the early 1960s by New York-born <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, now a member of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and head of extremist, anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview on Monday from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> was not involved.

The question of which field of learning is most important may be as sticky as the one involving the chicken and the egg, but three professors took it on during a `` raft debate'' at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, a chemistry professor, opened the debate last Thursday by noting that he knew how to make aspirin, antibiotics and synthetic fabrics. `` If I'm saved, we can wear something besides animal skins,'' he said. `` Faulkner should not be read nor classes taught while dressed in animal skins.'' But <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartoo </PERSON>, the school's head of curriculum and instruction, countered the notion of better living through chemistry. `` I'm sure the island is looking forward to polyester leisure suits, one of the special contributions of chemistry to our lives,'' he said, before arguing that his ability to train others to teach made his specialty the most valuable. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderlin </PERSON>, an English professor and language specialist, argued that without a means to translate thoughts into written words, the island's residents would have difficulty teaching others or assimilating technology. `` Mr. <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> can work magic, but what happens when he dies?'' <PERSON> Sanderlin </PERSON> asked. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bartoo </PERSON> can lead these children along the beach and show them the possibilities of curriculum reform. But what happens after that?'' `` All of these things are important, <PERSON> Sanderlin </PERSON> said. `` The trouble is that at some points in history you ca n't have them all at the same time and you must make choices.''

 <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> health officials say a monthlong epidemic of hepatitis is now under control, a report said today. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city as saying some patients are now being discharged from hospitals and no new cases have been reported in the past few days. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> health officials said last week that 16,000 people in the city of 12 million had contracted hepatitis, 90 percent from eating clams contaminated in polluted coastal waters. Western doctors in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> estimated that the number of sick could be as high as 40,000. Reports from the city said medical departments were adding more than 25,000 hospital beds to the existing 2,820 in infectious disease wards. Emergency wards were set up in some factories and schools. The latest report appeared to allay earlier concerns that the disease would hit a second peak this week as people became infected from those already down with hepatitis. The report said hepatitis, a virus disease inflaming the liver and causing vomiting, diarrhea and fever, is common to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, an overcrowded city with serious sanitation problems. It said ordinarily there are 30 to 40 hepatitis cases a day over the winter months, but in mid-January this year 130 people a day were being hospitalized.

<TEXT>
 About 2,500 tugboat workers and other marine employees went on strike today against nine marine transport companies after efforts to reach a new contract failed. Pickets said they hoped to shut down <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` We're going to try,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who was on a picket line this morning `` It's our livelihood.'' About 200 pickets went up about 12:01 a.m., said police Officer <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, adding, `` It's been real quiet.'' Police said Monday they were moving to head off possible confrontations between strikers and replacement workers. Lt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said 100 officers would be assigned to watch towing companies on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON>, president of Local 333 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said his 2,500 members on Monday unanimously rejected companies' demands to eliminate 750 jobs and for wage and benefit concessions from 40 percent to 62 percent. `` We offered them a contract to keep them competitive,'' <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said, `` but ... all they want to do is break us.'' He said he proposed the current contract with no improvements for the next three years. `` But they want to eliminate our pension plan; they want to take away vacations and eliminate overtime pay,'' <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said. Officials of the marine-towing companies refused to comment. Salaries for Local 333 members range from $ 385 a day for captains to $ 175 a day for deckhands, based on a 12-hour day with overtime, <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said. He said members earn an average of $ 35,000 a year. It was too early to tell how the strike would affect the movement of cargo through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, according to shipping officials. `` We'd like to make sure the cargo keeps flowing,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for shipping companies. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Governors Island station said safety zones were being established in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> waters.

 The government plans to enact into permanent law an anti-terrorism measure it introduced to counter the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, allowing police to hold people without charge for a week, news reports said today. The reports come at a time of worsening of Anglo-Irish relations. Recently, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> suspended the processing of extradition warrants from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> and other newspapers said Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government plans to enact the Prevention of Terrorism Act instead of having Parliament renew it annually. The act would apply to all of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. To make it permanent, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> must submit it to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for approval. The Home Office refused to confirm the reports, but said in a statement that Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> is `` likely to be making an announcement'' on the matter. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the announcement would come today. <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> has criticized the act, so its permanent enactment is thought likely to worsen Anglo-Irish relations, which deteriorated sharply last month over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal to prosecute police who allegedly killed six unarmed Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1982. The act, intended as a temporary measure when first introduced in 1974 as a means to help combat the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, is now also used against international terrorism in general. It allows police to hold people without charge for up to seven days without having to inform anyone or bring them before a court. The Irish government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> alleges that British police have used the act to harass <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people and gather information on the Irish community in general. In some cases, <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government ministers have been held at British airports under the act, leading to diplomatic complaints. Critics say more than 1 million people have been detained under the act at one time or another, but that less than 200 were subsequently convicted of any offense. British government figures show that of 225 people held under the act last year only 27 were subsequently charged with an offense. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government says the act has played a major role in fighting terrorism. The government said the act allowed police in June 1985 to prevent an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing campaign in mainland British resorts. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> under socialist rule. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said after meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Friday that relations between the two governments were at an impasse. It was the first meeting between the leaders since the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> government on Jan. 25 acknowledged there was evidence of a conspiracy to obstruct justice following the killing of six unarmed Catholics by police in three separate incidents in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1982. Irish anger was sparked by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s announcement that it would not prosecute the officers allegedly involved. <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has suspended processing British extradition warrants for suspects wanted in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the British mainland, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. It said the <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> government had accused British authorities of failing to comply with terms of a new extradition law the Irish <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed Dec. 10. The terms include a requirement that supporting evidence should accompany requests for extradition, and Attorney General Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has refused to do so. Irish press reports said that, as a result, Irish law officers have since taken no action on at least five British extradition warrants, none of which concerned terrorist cases.

 A power Sinhalese politician and popular actor who was expected to run for president was assassinated at his home today, a day after his political alliance condemned recent killings by radical Sinhalese nationalists. Senior police officials blamed the death of <PERSON> Vijaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON> on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, 43, led the Sri Lankan Mahajana -LRB- People's -RRB- Party and was expected to run as a candidate for president with the backing of his party and two other small leftist groups. The popular film star was killed with a submachine gun while talking to several people in the yard of his home in <LOCATION> Polhengoda </LOCATION>, four miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. Another man was injured by the gunfire. <PERSON> Kamaranatunga </PERSON>'s body was sprawled under a mango tree, with a bullet hole through an appointment book he was carrying, witnesses said. Relatives said he was about to leave for a luncheon at the American Embassy. Besides condemining radical Sinhalese terrorists, <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON> was a supporter of the Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord that aims to end the insurgency by separatists from the Tamil minority. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord, and President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> has blamed the front for the deaths of more than 150 government officials and members of his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of people gathered at <LOCATION> Kamaranatunga </LOCATION>'s home and <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where the politician's body was taken. A scuffle broke out near the hospital morgue, where teen-agers and elderly women wailed over the death. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Chandrika </PERSON>, the daughter of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, was at the hospital. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON> was standing in his yard talking to four other people when two men rode up on a motorcycle at about noon, said <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Canagaratnam </PERSON>, chief of the police crime detection bureau. The cycle passenger got off, opened fire with a submachine gun, then escaped with the motorcycle driver, <PERSON> Canagaratnam </PERSON> said. On Monday, <PERSON> Kumaratunga </PERSON>'s Mahajana -LRB- People's -RRB- Party and the two other leftist parties issued a strongly worded statement condemning killings of politicians by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kumaratunga </PERSON> was also one of the earliest and most vocal supporters of the July 29 peace accord, which was sponsored by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and designed to end a 4-year-old Tamil separatist guerrilla war that has left about 8,000 people dead. His mother-in-law, Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposes the accord, was prime minister from 1960 to 1965 and from 1970 to 1977. Her husband, S.W.F.D. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, was prime minister from 1956 until his assassination in 1959. <PERSON> Kumaratunga </PERSON>'s family is Sinhalese, the ethnic group comprising 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Tamils, who account for 18 percent, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and military. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent troops to its island neighbor last July to enforce the peace pact. After Tamil rebels rejected the accord and went on a killing spree against Sinhalese civilians, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> launched an Oct. 10 offensive to disarm the largest rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says between 45,000 and 48,000 of its soldiers are now deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm the rebels.

Each one composes a samba based on a historical, folk or political theme and then outfits 4,000 to 5,000 members who sing and enact that theme along the parade route.

 A car burst into flames early today about 40 yards from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s official <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> residence and office, killing the driver, and police said no explosives were found. Police bomb squad officers raced to 10 Downing St. shortly after midnight fearing a possible terrorist attack. However, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard later said in a statement: `` There was no trace of an explosive device.'' It added: `` At no time did the car make any attempt to enter Downing Street and therefore the prime minister was not in any danger.'' <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said the victim had been out of work for over a year and had killed himself to protest unemployment. The unemployment rate in December was 9.7 percent. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said gasoline cans were believed to have been found inside the car and that one theory was that the driver deliberately started the fire in order to commit suicide. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard refused to comment on the reports or to identify the badly burned driver pending an autopsy. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Evening Standard identified the driver as <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainbridge </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Worksop </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and said he gave up his job as a street sweeper 14 months ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office in a statement confirmed that the prime minister had been at 10 Downing Street at the time of the incident. The <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokesman, speaking anonymously, said police did not yet know what caused the green <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viva </ORGANIZATION> auto to burst into flames at the entrance to Downing Street from <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, the main thoroughfare in the area. `` A car pulled up in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> at the entrance to Downing Street and burst into flames. The fire was put out by <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> and the body of a man was found inside the car,'' the <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard statement said. The incident was witnessed by a police officer on duty at the metal security barriers that separate Downing Street from <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>. The car had been traveling down <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> from the direction of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> was sealed off for about three hours as police investigated the burned-out auto before removing it. Police estimated that the car was about 40 yards from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s residence. Downing Street is a very short, dead-end street with No. 10 located toward the far end from <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A few puddles were all that remained of the water at the <LOCATION> Trevi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> on Tuesday as surveyors began measuring the landmark for a facelift, but that did n't stop visitors from throwing coins into its empty basin. The water was turned off so that workers could carry out a photographic survey in preparation for the first restoration of the 17th century fountain in more than 30 years. The restoration is aimed at removing discoloration caused by smog. The project will last a year but will proceed in stages and the water will run in the parts of the fountain where the work is not being done. Officials said the work will cost about $ 830,000. The fountain, built of travertine and marble, was designed by the sculptor <PERSON> Bernini </PERSON> in 1640 and executed by <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvi </PERSON> 90 years later. Legend has it that a visitor who tosses a coin in the fountain will return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> some day.

<TEXT>
 A symbolic `` memorial route'' is being built through the former <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto, ending at the square where nearly 300,000 Jews were loaded onto railway cars bound for the <ORGANIZATION> Treblinka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp. The route is to be ready in time for ceremonies April 19 marking the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto uprising, the official Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Several thousand people from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries are expected to attend. The route is to be marked with 16 shiny black stones, beginning at the monument to the heroes of the uprising in which poorly armed Jewish fighters died resisting the final <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> drive to liquidate the ghetto's 60,000 remaining Jews. One stone marker will be placed near the mound at 18 <ORGANIZATION> Mila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> built on the ruins of the bunker headquarters of <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Anielewicz </PERSON>, the leader of the uprising. It will end at the so-called `` Umschlagplatz'' or `` Loading Square'' on <LOCATION> Stawki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, near the former railroad ramps. Between July 1942 and April 1943, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> loaded nearly 300,000 Jews onto boarded-up cattle cars bound for the gas chambers of <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The Umschlagplatz currently is marked by a modest bronze plaque near a busy gas station, but a newly constructed monument will be unveiled in April. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> municipal authorities had allocated about $ 132,000 for the project. International Jewish organizations raised about $ 30,000, with some of the money covering the cost of importing special stone-cutting machines.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> broke <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' 20-week winning streak last week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. For the week ending Feb. 12, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had an average rating of 11.8 and a 20 share The `` CBS Evening News'' had an 11.1 and 19. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 19. The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. CBS dropped to third for several weeks last summer, but rebounded in September when <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> introduced the new `` people meter'' rating system. All three newscasts have long been engaged in a tight race. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s showing. However, last week's ratings could have been affected by coverage of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. `` We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or coverage of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, and with live programming like the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hearings,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adde </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s prime-time special on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> ranked a respectable 44 out of 68.

<TEXT>
 An engineer accused of running a stop signal and driving three freight locomotives into the path of a speeding passenger train pleaded guilty today to one count of manslaughter in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s deadliest crash ever. The state agreed to drop 15 other manslaughter counts against former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> in the Jan. 4, 1987, crash, <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. The crash killed 16 people and injured more than 170 others. The names of the other 15 victims will be added to the single count of manslaughter by locomotive. The agreement was announced as jury selection for <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' trial was to begin. Mrs. O ` <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said the state has reserved the right to ask for the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a $ 1,000 fine. Sentencing was set for March 29. Gates was operating three <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives that prosecutors say ran the stop signal in <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, and wound up in front of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train traveling about 120 mph. After the hearing, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> told reporters outside the courthouse, `` I am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence. `` I ca n't begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families. I am sorry,'' he said. According to the statement of facts read in court today, the signals told <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> to slow the locomotives to 30 mph and then to stop before reaching the switch. The statement said that former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> brakeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> would have testified that he smoked a marijuana cigarette with <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> in the train cab. However, experts could not agree whether the marijuana would have impaired Gates' performance, said the statement agreed to by both sides. The summary also said <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> failed to correct five safety violations before he took the locomotives out of the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> yard for the trip to <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, including a failure to have a working whistle and speed warning light, and adequate train radio. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Ceres </PERSON> <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, was killed in the crash, cried and shook her head as the 48-page statement was read. Federal investigators have said <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, failed to notice the stop signals because of marijuana and possibly alcohol use. Gates has denied smoking marijuana while operating the train. Testimony had been expected to focus on drug use, warning whistles and lights in the locomotive cab, and a series of approach signals to the switch where four tracks converge to two at the <LOCATION> Gunpowder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> railroad bridge. <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> has been granted immunity and had been expected to testify that he and <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> fabricated a story to cover up their marijuana smoking on the train. Chief Public Defender <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said that defense attorneys will try to discredit <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> by pointing out that he ran from the scene while <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> stayed to `` help save lives.'' Gates' attorneys said they will present evidence that the track signals often malfunction, contrary to official statements. The county grand jury's indictment announced May 4 accused Gates of gross negligence. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> for 14 years, has said signals indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol. Blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> had traces of marijuana in their bodies, but a recent court ruling in a different case could have hampered use of this evidence by prosecutors. The men were tested under a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rule requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a serious accident, but the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional. The railroad administration has said it will appeal and the ruling's effect on the trial remains uncertain. It stands as official precedent only in the circuit court's area, which does not include <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, but may affect judicial thinking elsewhere. Even if the evidence had been allowed, prosecutors would have had to prove <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was impaired by the drugs, not just that he was using them. The trial could have implications for government control over train operators and for more than $ 294 million in civil suits arising from the crash. The railroad administration has said the crash already has helped it in its battle for federal control over licensing and training of engineers. The federal government had no authority to punish <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> or <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, both of whom resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> says his service in <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army reflects the `` normal fate of a young Austrian'' during World War II and says he wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to release secret documents about his past. In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' broadcast early today, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> reiterated that he had a clear conscience and would not step down as president despite growing opposition within <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` I have not hidden anything of my military career,'' he said. `` I think this whole accusation is unfounded.'' He gave the 80-minute interview to the network Monday, immediately following a short televised speech to the Austrian nation. In the speech he said that he rejects the conclusions of a panel of experts commissioned by the Austrian government to review his war record. In a 202-page report issued last week, the six historians questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral integrity, saying he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing to stop them. Though the panel said it found no evidence <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, had committed war crimes, it concluded he tried to cover up his involvement in World War II, which was disclosed nearly two years ago during the presidential campaign. In his interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> maintained that he could still function in the ceremonial post of Austrian president despite the controversy about his past. He was elected in June 1986 with 53.6 percent of the vote. The 69-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in putting him on a list of undesirable aliens last year, had committed `` a serious violation of international law.'' `` No state has a right to put a foreign head of state under its own jurisdiction,'' he said. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said he wanted to appeal the ruling and have the secret documents it was based on made public. But, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the only way to appeal the ruling was to apply for a visa, which he said was unacceptable to a head of state. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> lashed out at those who said he is lying about what he knew and those who cite as evidence that in his writing about his past he left out the details of his military career. He said his military service in <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army was a common experience for Austrians. `` If one pretends that I was lying because I did not give all the details of my military career right from the beginning, this is not something that I can accept,'' he said. Serving in the German army was `` the normal fate of a young Austrian of let's say 20, 22 years of age. To make him responsible for the wrongdoings of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>, which I condemned, this is not fair.'' At the end of the interview, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> appealed for understanding from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. `` If I have misled my friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because I did n't say anything as far as my military career is concerned, I am sorry. ... It was not done purposely. Believe me. And I hope this will be understood because I have so many friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And I hope they will believe me that I have n't done anything wrong.''

 Two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships have left the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> after an incident last week in which they were deliberately bumped by Soviet ships off the coast of <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The cruiser Yorktown and the destroyer <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> steamed uneventfully through the Turkish Straits and back into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> declined to say where the two ships were now bound. The Yorktown and <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Feb. 10 under orders to assert international navigation rights. As a result, last Friday the two ships moved inside the 12-mile limit claimed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while steaming past the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. In response, two Soviet warships deliberately bump the sides of the Yorktown and <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, causing minor damage and prompting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to file a protest with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Unlike the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims a three-mile territorial limit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepts other nations' claims of a 12-mile limit, but it insists that foreign nations honor what is known as the right of `` innocent passage'' for ships passing through waters between three and 12 miles offshore.

 The New Hampshire of white steepled churches and tree-lined lakes still exists. But when presidential candidates want to find lots of voters, they go to malls that could just as easily be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Gone are the small southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> farms whose owners set up stands to sell eggs and sweet corn to weekend drivers from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. They've been replaced by high-tech companies and suburban sprawl. Also ebbing is the personal touch that has been a hallmark of many <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaigns. There was a time when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters really did meet presidential candidates, shake hands and question them eye to eye _ met most of them and often met them more than once. But most people who voted in the state primary on Tuesday, especially those who live south of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, the state capital, got no closer to a candidate than their television sets. Maybe that does n't matter. <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, who was deputy press spokesman for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign, is working on a book about the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. In four bitterly contested primaries, he points out, the winner never set foot in the state. When <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> in 1952 and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> upset <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> in 1964, the winner not only shook no voter's hand, he was n't even in the country. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in 1968 and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1980. In both cases the winners were incumbent presidents under severe challenge. They won without ever campaigning personally in the state. Although he lost, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> did well enough to startle observers and send the first clear message that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was in political trouble. In 1976, President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> campaigned three days in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and still beat challenger <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The North Country most closely resembles the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> of post cards and calendars. Nestled in the valleys of the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> are scores of towns and pristine lakes, stands of pine and white birch. But look closely. Also part of that landscape now are massive condominium developments, second homes to thousands of people in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corridor </LOCATION>. In fact, candidates run the risk in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> that the hand they shake may mark a ballot in some other state. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greeted voters at <LOCATION> Pheasant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, the state's newest and biggest enclosed paradise for shoppers It sits on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s southern border and the odds are that the vice president met more people from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> than from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Six candidates spoke at a `` Rally Finale'' at the Mall of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Their platform was set up between the <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> shoe store and Zales Jewelers. Huge television screens projected the candidates' images throughout the covered mall and that was how most people saw them. Shoppers who tried to crowd in close enough to actually view a candidate in the flesh were frustrated by a platform set up for television cameras. `` We ca n't see, we ca n't see,'' they chanted. It was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in 1988. At least that's what the sign on the platform said.

 The Dragon swallowed the Rabbit at midnight Tuesday, beginning a three-day party and a new year named for the symbol of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ lucky for business, marriage and the `` dragon babies'' born before it ends. Nearly everyone in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> _ wealthy businessmen, factory workers, maids, restaurant waiters _ left their jobs to welcome the Lunar New Year with feasts, gambling and visits to relatives with gifts of candy and `` Lai See'' -LRB- Lucky Money -RRB- for all the children they know and many they do n't. Posters in the gleaming subway system urged celebrants not to carry such traditional objects as lighted joss sticks and roasted pigs onto the trains. Markets in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were crammed with festival foods, railroad stations were full of holiday travelers and signs emblazoned with dragons heralded the start of the year 4686, named for the most auspicious of the 12 animals in Chinese astrology. Thousands of people from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, to which the <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists fled after the communist victory of 1949, were expected to visit the mainland Last year, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s government lifted a ban on visits to allow family reunions. At New Year, normally thrifty Chinese throw financial caution to the winds and blow several months' pay on good cheer, gifts and games of chance. Government statistics indicate about 400,000 of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million people had left by Tuesday for holidays abroad, and many more were expected to go. The pro-Beijing <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1.8 million people from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> would spend the holiday in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, primarily in the neighboring province of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, where many have their ancestral roots. A company official said about 6,000 people from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were expected to visit the mainland. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> businesses began closing during the day Tuesday, in anticipation of the holiday, which officially ends Friday but will run through the weekend for many. Extra service was added to the city transport system to deal with the mobile feast. A fireworks display that cost more than $ 230,000 is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people to the shores of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Thursday night. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the holiday has been renamed Spring Festival for the 1949 Communist victory and traditionally is the most important of each year. State-owned newspapers say the luck believed to accompany the dragon has led to a dramatic increase in the number of couples registering for marriage in hopes of having a `` dragon baby.'' The papers describe the attitude as `` feudal'' and lecture against it. Over the past decade, the communist authorities have taken a more relaxed attitude toward other New Year customs formerly classified as fedual. Folk fairs at temples and former temple sites have been revived, giving the holiday some of the traditional flavor. A temple fair at Dragon's Pool Park in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, one of the year's special dragon-related activities, attracted more than 50,000 people Monday. The fair is the largest in the capital, with more than 10 troupes providing folk entertainment and several hundred stalls lining the half-mile-long rim of the pool, selling 100 varieties of snack foods, folk art, toys and clothing. Officials have restricted the supply of fireworks because of casualties and damage caused in the past. The New Year customarily was greeted with a deafening roar of firecrackers, which continued virtually non-stop for several days. About $ 2.7 million worth of fireworks were sold in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last year and some families spent as much as 200 yuan -LRB- $ 54 -RRB-, the equivalent of two months' pay. This year, the government reduced the supply by 30 percent. Fireworks were blamed last year for 3,040 fires that killed 17 people and caused nearly $ 1 million in damage.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dueled <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for Republican advantage Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s kickoff presidential primary, while <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bid for a decisive victory in the Democratic struggle for supremacy and survival. The first returns, as always, came from tiny Dixville Notch, which gave 11 votes of hope to Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 6 to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Seven Notchers went Democrat, split 4-to-3 between second-place contenders Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Pre-election polls said the GOP race was a tossup, with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> propelled by victory in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> struggling to rebound from a disappointing third-place finish there. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, their candidacies at stake, bid for third place against <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the first test for the former television evangelist in a primary election. To a man they said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters would deliver a surprise. `` It's going to be an interesting contest,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said during a chance election-morning encounter with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` I met three of'em that voted for me early so I hope that holds.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rivals conceded him a victory in advance. They vied for second place and hoped to deny the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor a huge victory that would give him a boost for the delegate-rich contests ahead. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, one-time front-runner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> were back in the pack in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> surveys, with <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> hoping to avoid a drubbing that would doom their campaigns. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished one-two in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and just ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, engaged one another in an angry fight over some <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> ads critical of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s voting record. `` We're gon na run very well,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said Tuesday morning as he aimed to upend the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman and further scramble the wide-open Democratic race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cautioned, `` Anything can happen. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters are very independent,'' but he was confident enough to talk about his plans for March 8 when 20 states, including 14 Southern or border states, will hold Super Tuesday primaries or caucuses. `` We're going to contest every one of those states,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.'' In terms of delegates, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was small stakes indeed. Democrats were allotting 18 of their 22 delegates to the national convention next summer, with 23 spots at stake on the Republican side. But it was n't delegates that drew the candidates and their television advertising dollars to a sparsely settled state with a reputation for upsetting front-runners and elevating upstarts. It was the prospect of momentum and the ability to attract campaign funds needed next month. Then again, as <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> boosters never tire of pointing out, no one has ever won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> without a victory in the first-in-the-nation primary since the Granite State started going first in 1952. There was every reason to believe that for some, the first primary would also be the last. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> conceded that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters had power of life and death over his quest. Others were less direct, though <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> were locked in a struggle with each other and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to emerge as a conservative alternative to the front-runners. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the favorite son, had a different concern. His aides pointed out that the largest margin in history for a contest of this sort was 11 percentage points. And they worried aloud about winners in past <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> being viewed as losers because they did worse that expected _ <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1968 and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> four years later.

 The traditional <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> marathon became a sprint this year in the eight days following last Monday night's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> jumbled the field somewhat, setting up <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s confrontation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here and giving impetus to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s hope to outlast <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont among conservatives. Within days of his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> gobbled up <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once once-commanding lead in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> polls and said a follow-up win here might all but assure him the nomination. The vice president retooled his style and his campaign message in a bid to regain his footing. Scrapping the trappings of his office, he largely abandoned formal speeches in favor of campaigning in a ski parka and driving a forklift around a lumberyard. He pleaded guilty to the faults of poor oratory and lack of passion on the stump, but said that should n't be mistaken for lack of concern. `` Here I stand, warts and all,'' he said, recalling <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s words. If he was n't embracing President <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, it was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> effort in the same <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, town hall where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ended his in 1980. If <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were not coattail enough, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned Monday with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> baseball hero <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and conservative hero <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, riding the crest of his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> wave, tried not to offend. `` I want to be nice to everybody this week,'' he said. Even so, he could n't resist a few jabs at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he vied with the vice president for the support of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s admirers. `` He did what I did in 1980,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said early Tuesday of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` He won in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and came in and talked about momentum. I did what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did. He -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- came in and started talking the issues as I've been doing ... and I think it's working.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> branded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as certain tax raisers, and du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> thrust a `` no-tax pledge'' in front of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> during a debate and demanded that he sign it. -LRB- He did n't. -RRB- <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, unable to afford a fourth-place finish behind <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, attacked the former minister for `` deliberate distortions'' on his television advertising and in printed flyers. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whose second-place finish was the surprise of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> might be startling, too. But he found himself embroiled in an eleventh-hour controversy when the White House denied his startling claim that there are <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. And he was peppered with questions about statements he made over the years from his TV ministry. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> benefited from his decade's service as governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and his long-standing opposition to the unfinished <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. His aides watched anxiously to see whether <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would develop a tidal wave of momentum following his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> win, but it never materialized in the polls. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> delivered the same anti-establishment message that carried him to his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory, but he found himself trying to fend off attacks that he had flip-flopped on numerous issues over the years, and fell into a nasty battle with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` When you say in a TV ad, ` who do you trust,' you're really bring into play motives, motivation and whether or not somebody is reliable and I think that goes over the line,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, whose campaign demanded that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> withdraw his commercials. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> refused and said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was campaigning as a supporter of Reaganomics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> after posing as an opponent in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a no show in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, spent time and money in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and hoped to develop a non-Southern base. But he diverted some of his television money off into Southern and border states, a fresh indication that his eggs are in one basket _ the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> states that begin to vote next month. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> pleaded with the voters to accept his national sales tax proposal to reduce the deficit, and he asked voters to prove the pundits wrong in counting him out of the Democratic race. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> campaigned extensively in the state that catapulted him to prominence in 1984, and said his comeback would continue no matter what. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> looking for substantial support in the south, chastised the others in a debate and urged his rivals to address the issues. He did better than expected in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and hoped to finish in double-digits in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, faced with an adverse court ruling, has rescinded a virtual ban on security clearances for naturalized citizens from countries deemed hostile to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. A federal judge who barred the Pentagon from enforcing the regulation against two naturalized citizens from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was informed by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the April 8, 1987 regulations had been rescinded and the lawsuit against them was moot. `` <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizens born in countries designated as hostile or who have resided in those coutries for significant periods of their lives will be considered for security clearances on an equal basis with natural-born citizens,'' government attorneys told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> in a memo filed last Friday. On Feb. 3, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> enjoined the Pentagon from enforcing the regulations against <PERSON> Phong </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>, an electrical engineer at the Naval Surface Warfare Center and his sister, <PERSON> Vien </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>, a computer scientists at the same facility in <LOCATION> Dahlgren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The two had fled their homeland in 1978 by boat with other refugees and emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where they both obtained their formal education and American citizenship. The Huynhs filed suit to challenge the regulations after being told they would likely lose their security clearances and their jobs. When he granted an injunction in the <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to rescind the regulations to avoid a lengthy court battle. The judge said the regulations appeared to be unreasonable and unconstitutional. The regulations generally barred security clearances for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who had immigrated from 29 nations deemed hostile to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Besides <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the list of countries included Soviet bloc nations, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. An individual who was born in one of the 29 countries would be eligible to obtain a security clearance only if the person had been an American citizen for at least five years or has resided in this country for at least a decade.

<TEXT>
 Police on Tuesday detained about 150 costumed people who tried to stage a carnival parade in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> mocking the government's economic reform policies, an opposition activist said. The demonstration was staged by a group called <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION>, whose satirical street theater events are broken up regularly by police, said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a Wroclaw opposition activist. About 2,000 people gathered during the afternoon rush hour to watch the carnival parade in the city's <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, which had been announced in leaflets scattered around the city, <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said. But about 30 police vans and dozens of plainclothes and uniformed policemen were also on the scene to break up the demonstration, <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said. `` Second stage of reform: carnival. Third stage of reform: fast,'' said a banner carried by several of the costumed demonstrators, some of whom were dressed in penitents' garb, <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said. The event took place on the eve of Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, which is widely observed in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. Demonstrators also played discordant music on various instruments. <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said police spent more than an hour rounding up about 150 costumed demonstrators who gathered in groups and mingled with the crowd in the streets. In some cases, police sprayed gas from hand-held canisters to detain individual demonstrators, <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said. Police also conducted frequent identity checks. A duty officer at <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> police headquarters refused to comment on the reported detentions. In previous cases, police have broken up Orange Alternative events and released the participants after holding them for several hours.

 <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Streiff </PERSON> won the Liberal leg of the Shrove Tuesday trans-Atlantic pancake race for a second consecutive year today, but for the sixth straight time the title went to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Streiff </PERSON>, carrying a frying pan with a pancake in it, completed the 415-yard course in 67.7 seconds. That was better than her winning time of 70.1 seconds last year, but not enough to better that of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a physical education teacher from <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Running six hours earlier in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> turned in a winning time of 62.9 seconds. The British victory tied the series at 19 each. Mrs. <PERSON> Streiff </PERSON>, a 30-year-old mother of three, also won in 1985 and as a three-time winner will not be able to compete again. `` I did n't think of the pancake, I just ran,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. `` I have n't done any training, though sometimes when I take the dog out for a walk, I have a little trot.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> outpaced 19 other women by about 10 yards at the end of the 415-yard annual run from <PERSON> Olney </PERSON>'s market square to its 14th-century church. The competitors all wore the traditional skirt, apron and head scarf. About 700 spectators lined the twisting route in cool, sunny weather in the <LOCATION> Buckinghamshire </LOCATION> market town of 3,300 inhabitants about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Previously, competitors had continuously to flip a pancake in a pan as they ran, but nowadays only a toss at the start and finish is required. According to legend, the race has been run in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION> since 1445, when a forgetful housewife left for church on Shrove Tuesday with her frying pan still in her hand. Shrove Tuesday is the day English women traditionally make pancakes to use up cooking fat before the start of 40 days of fasting for Lent. After a lapse during World War II, <PERSON> Olney </PERSON> revived the race in 1948. People in the southwest <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> town joined the race in 1950 to make the contest an international event after seeing reports of the English competition. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> received her prize of 100 pounds -LRB- $ 175 -RRB-, various gifts from town merchants, an inscribed silver tray from the town of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION>, and a kiss from <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Coverley </PERSON>, a ceremonial official known as the town verger. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, a housewife who finished second, received 10 pounds -LRB- $ 17.50 -RRB- and vouchers from local shops. A lemon juice company claimed a survey it conducted had found that at least 63 million pancakes would be served in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today and be sprinkled with 166,000 gallons of lemon juice made from more than 2 million lemons. A host of British celebrities tossed pancakes in a 12-hour marathon today at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> train station to raise money for charity.

 The president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s federal archives said Tuesday he repeatedly warned American officials at a U.S.-run Nazi records center that documents were apparently being stolen from the center. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Booms </PERSON> said he warned the center's American director, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, of indications someone was pilfering Nazi records from the center and selling them for profit through antique dealers since at least 1982. He gave similar warnings to officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Booms </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Koblenz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the director since 1974, said he received tips from officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and eventually passed them to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> justice authorities. `` They notified me of a possible problem in 1982, and I cooperated with them,'' he said. `` They gave us some tips and we followed through.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials asked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities to investigate, but he declined to comment further `` because there is an investigation under way.'' This week, spokesman <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said investigators suspect the deputy director of the Nazi archives center was allegedly involved in the theft of tens of thousands of Nazi-era documents from the center. He identified him only as a West German. <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON> said prosecutors believe the missing documents were sold to dealers around the world for considerable sums. The Berlin Document Center houses up to 30 million files and documents captured from the Germans at the end of World War II.

 Champion market animals will be tested for drugs for the first time this week at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION>, but no animal stands to lose a ribbon because of doping, officials said. `` This is the first stock show where anything like this is being done in the nation,'' Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlund </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> veterinarian who is coordinating the tests, told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express-News </ORGANIZATION>.

Veterinarians are concerned that some show animals might be given drugs such as diuretics, tranquilizers or anabolic steroids which give the owner an unfair advantage, he said. A similar program will be conducted at the stock show in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelo </LOCATION> next month, and at other shows in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 The discovery of two species of the daddy-longlegs insect family in <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> may block a proposed 18-hole golf course. Both species are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of <LOCATION> Sitalcina </LOCATION> minor.

 The opening of a six-bed hospice for dying AIDS patients has drawn protests from neighbors who say they are n't afraid of catching the deadly disease but do fear the facility will lower property values The <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> hospice, named after the man hospice officials say was the first employee of the nearby city of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to die of AIDS, opened Monday in a leased, bungalow-style three-bedroom home. Unhappy neighbors say they fear the hospice will bring ambulances, hospital supply trucks, and, eventually, cars from the county coroner's office to their quiet residential street. `` It's like living next to a hospital,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Meleck </PERSON>, whose home is directly behind the hospice. But City Councilman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> said the hospice is not a hospital, but `` a place where AIDS patients can die with respect and dignity.'' Some residents had attempted to keep the facility from opening, saying it needed a zoning variance to operate in the neighborhood. But the city attorney's office said that hospices could operate in residential zones as long as they were kept to a maximum of six beds, <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensel </PERSON>, who leased the home to <ORGANIZATION> Hospice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> @ <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said he was shocked by his neighbors' reaction. `` What I found out is that except for the two closest neighbors ... the rest were only concerned about property values _ ` After so many years here, I'm going to lose ...,''' <PERSON> Hensel </PERSON> said. `` This is n't a hospital,'' he added. `` It's just a chance for people in their last few days to have some warm feelings in their hearts,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hospice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> @ <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> operates two other hospice facilities in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.

More than 1,200 people in the <LOCATION> Hollywood-Wilshire </LOCATION> area were diagnosed between 1981 and 1987 as having AIDS, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON>, medical director of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> AIDS Epidemiology Department. Sixty-two percent of them have died. `` Until now, there has been no facility in the city that gives the victims, who are our neighbors, a decent place to die in peace,'' Woo said. `` This is long overdue.''

<HEAD>Iraq Reports 25th Raid on Tanker This Year</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Tuesday its warplanes made the 25th air raid of the year on an Iranian tanker in the campaign to destroy <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil exports and end the 7-year-old war. Only a few of the raids have been confirmed by shipping agents, salvage executives or other independent sources. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its aircraft made a damaging raid on a petrochemical plant near <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern provincial capital. The report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> gave no details and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not comment. Another U.S.-escorted convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers made its way down the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and a new <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> command ship, the <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, arrived in the gulf with four other American warships. A dispatch from the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> news agency said warplanes attacked `` a very large maritime target,'' the standard phrase for a supertanker, off the Iranian coast overnight. It did not give an exact time for the raid and there was no independent verification. The news agency quoted a military spokesman, not identified, as saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` will continue to destroy naval targets that ferry Iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance the aggression against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> uses its own and chartered tankers to move crude oil from the <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> export terminal in the northern gulf, which is a frequent target of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> bombers, to makeshift terminals in safer waters about 450 miles down the gulf. Included in the U.S.-escorted convoy, which left <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Sunday, were the 294,739-ton <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, an oil products carrier, and the 46,723-ton liquefied gas tanker Gas Princess, escorted by the missile frigate <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. It was the 12th this year and 36th since convoys began last July. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> registration and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags to 11 Kuwaiti tankers so the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> can protect them. The 17,000-ton <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON> will become flagship of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf and the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION>, command ship in the region for many years, will undergo a major overhaul at <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON> did similar duty in 1981-82. In other changes, the 18,000-ton helicopter carrier <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> is leaving and command will be transferred in late February to Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Less </PERSON> from Rear Adm. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>. Other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> arrivals, the missile cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> and frigates <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, replace departing ships but the <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> will not be replaced when it sails for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this week with the last four mine-sweeping helicopters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say withdrawal of the <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, which will cut the gulf force from 17 ships to 16, is part of a plan to reduce the cost of the escort operation, now running at an estimated $ 25 million a month. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported raids on military and other installations at the southern end of the 730-mile border war front. The activity appeared connected to Iranian preparations for a long-anticipated winter offensive. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has marshaled about 300,000 men in the southern area near <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, where it has mounted several major offensives since the war began in September 1980.

<HEAD>Cut in Hospital Profits Said Threat to Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> budget-trimming has squeezed hospital profits to the point where health care for the elderly could be threatened, according to testimony Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The `` hospital operating profit margins are just one indicator that the federal government may have cut into the heart of an already-shredded safety net protecting the elderly,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the committee chairman Hospital average profit margins under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s payment system were above 14 percent in 1984 and 1985, then dropped to 9.6 percent in 1986, according to federal statistics. Projections show that hospitals, on the average, will lose money on <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients by next year. `` We are approaching a critical juncture where further reductions and a lack of predictability could begin to have an effect on the provision of care to this nation's elderly and poor,'' said a statement submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, at White House urging, has enacted in the past few years a cost control system for Medicare, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to propose further belt-tightening in the fiscal 1989 budget he submits on Thursday. The Medicare program doubled in cost between 1980 to 1987, to $ 80 billion, and is expected to exceed $ 100 billion next year. Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Prospective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which reports on the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payment system, said the downward trend in hospital profits appeared to be continuing and `` the access of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries to quality care could be threatened.'' However, he said the most important reason for the profits decline was not a reduction in Medicare payments but the continuing increases in hospital costs. There have been `` few signs recently that hospitals are changing their behavior'' to increase efficiency or productivity, he said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, said the figures `` may have grave consequences for all older Americans,'' in part because of industry priorities. `` I find it unconscionable that the hospital industry would first react to news of declining profits by threatening to subject patients to lower-quality care and to deny them all the care they may require,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s survivors turn South on Wednesday for the next major battleground of the presidential campaign, with <PERSON> Tennessean </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> hoping to waylay the front-runners on his home ground but <PERSON> Northerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> saying he is conceding nothing. Among the Republicans, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is counting on superior organization in the South to hold off <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is hoping a strong showing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> can give him a boost heading into the Super Tuesday primaries. Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, `` We're going to contest every one of those states. I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Southerner like <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, was welcoming the change of scenery to a region where he has been at or near the top in polls of Democratic voters. His support is particularly strong among Southern blacks. After <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, several candidates were heading to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> where lower-stake contests are scheduled between now and March 8. But it is on that date, known as Super Tuesday, that more than one-third of the states will vote, including most of the South, in the closest thing ever to a national presidential primary. And most of the candidates are responding by turning their attention, time and money southward for what <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> called `` the main event'' of the campaign. What they will find is a massive territory where a thorough television campaign means buying airtime in 20 or more separate TV markets. That's an enormous expense and obstacle, particularly for those such as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> who are saddled with debt. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who claimed a pass to Super Tuesday regardless of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s verdict, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be his principal competitor in the South. He criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s defense-cut proposals, said his own experience was more `` directly relevant'' and said, `` Democrats in all parts of the country are really hungry for a victory in 1988 and interested in finding a nominee who can offer the best chance of beating the Republicans in the fall.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in recent speeches, has argued against what he says is a common though often-unspoken view that he can not win in 1988 because he is black, no matter how well he does in the South and elsewhere. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was pointing to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest on the Saturday before Super Tuesday. The expected low turnout of that primary, combined with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s constituency of fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> voters, made that Bible-belt state a likely spot for another strong showing by the former television preacher While <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> engaged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, the vice president was said to have a far superior organization throughout the South. It was a strong Southern organization _ in a much more limited regional primary _ that rescued former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s nomination hopes after he fell short in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in 1984. Still, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's claim to have a `` firewall of support'' in Southern states: `` It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the Democratic winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses last week, seemed a likely candidate to oppose <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> for the moderate-to-conservative <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and independent vote that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has been trying to appeal to since laying out relatively conservative stands on defense and foreign policy issues last fall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a strong Southern organization and was seen as particularly strong in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` I think <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is the one with the most potential to do well among Southern white voters, besides <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> political scientist. `` He can take votes away from <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, an Atlanta-based polltaker and analyst. Facing that possibility, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had begun stressing an appeal to blue-collar voters _ in contrast to his earlier strategy of concentrating on endorsements from the Southern political establishment. He toured a mill in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last week and stood in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> train yard with <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> where he shouted, `` This party and our country has to stand up for the average working men and women.'' The Southern campaign will include at least three Republican debates and four among the Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been the most successful fund-raiser among the Democratic candidates and thus at an advantage in the Southern TV wars. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign has been hoarding its money, and he said he will spend at least $ 2 million in the region. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, `` We must do well on Super Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it. We have a three-week campaign.''

<HEAD>US To Resume Aid To Fiji, Send Ambassador</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will discuss the resumption of aid to <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> and send an ambassador to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> archipelago in an attempt to encourage the country's return to democratic rule, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` In view of recent developments in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> that have set that nation on a course leading to the restoration of constitutional government, ambassador-designate <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochwarger </PERSON> will be proceeding to <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> in the near future to assume his duties in <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION>,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. The previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador ended his tour of duty in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> prior to the May 14, 1987 coup which overturned the island's parliamentary democracy and brought to power Col. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> The ambassador was not immediately replaced, partly as a sign of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> displeasure with the military takeover. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to deplore the circumstances that undermine democratic institutions in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. `` At the same time, the return of executive authority to civilian hands, and the public commitment of the interim civilian government ... to a process aimed at restoring constitutional government, is a positive step that we wish to encourage,'' she added. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> returned to civilian rule in December, when <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> appointed former governor-general Sir <PERSON> Penaiai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganilau </PERSON> as president and <PERSON> Ganilau </PERSON> returned Sir <PERSON> Kamisese </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> to his former post of prime minister. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> retains control of security matters. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was also starting consultations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on resuming the 1.3 million dollars in economic aid which was suspended following the May coup. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to unfreeze the funds.

<HEAD>Defense Chief Asks Harsher Laws To Fight Communist Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES W. HATTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said Tuesday that harsher laws are needed to combat the 19-year-old communist insurrection and recalled that he asked earlier for the death penalty to be restored. But he said said the rebellion was not at the stage where a state of national emergency was needed, while President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was quoted as saying suggestions she would impose martial law were ridiculous. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> noted at a news conference that 18 months ago, he recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the military fight the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. These included lengthening the time suspected rebels could be held without charge and restoring the death penalty for `` heinous crimes'' such as treason and rebellion. `` After a thorough assessment of the insurgency situation and the efficacy of the various government countermeasures and programs, the position of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and military -RRB- is that the present situation is not _ I repeat not _ of such gravity as to make compelling a declaration of a state of emergency,'' the defense chief said `` There is no need for the public, especially the international audience, to be put in a state of alarm and apprehension over this issue.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was apparently trying to spike widespread speculation that the military was pressuring the government to declare martial law. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defense committee, told reporters he discussed the issue Tuesday with the president and she assured him she would not declare a state of emergency and `` never really seriously considered'' it. `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> even described the idea of resorting to martial rule as ridiculous,'' he said. The senator said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had moved to improve the military's effectiveness, but that calls for a state of emergency were `` counterproductive'' here The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has bitter memories of eight years of martial law imposed by President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from 1972-81. About 100 communist rebels attacked a militia post on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, killing a militiaman, the military reported Tuesday. It said rebels attacked the outpost at <LOCATION> Pangatalan </LOCATION> village before dawn Monday near <LOCATION> Sindangan </LOCATION>, about 470 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province. Other rebels ambushed a detachment of soldiers sent to the village, and a civilian was killed by a stray bullet, the report said. The rebels then fled.

<HEAD>Funds For State Anniversary Celebration Wiped Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s financial troubles have eaten up the funds set aside for celebrating the 125th anniversary of statehood this summer. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and History commissioner, said his agency had saved $ 100,000 for the party. But before the any plans could be completed, the money was taken to help pay the state's massive backlog of bills. `` We'll have something, but it will be small and modest. But that might be more appropriate,'' <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said Tuesday. The money would have been used to educate people about the anniversary, provide grants for local governments to throw their own celebrations, and print a special edition of a journal of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> history. In addition, <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> had hoped to have a shindig on the state Capitol grounds this summer, as well as a celebration at Independence Hall in Wheeling. Instead, <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> lamented, `` We're down to a tiny ceremony.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was granted statehood on June 20, 1863, after delegates from the northwestern counties of what was then <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> met in Wheeling and voted to join the North during the Civil War. The $ 100,000 fell victim to the state's bills, which amount to more than $ 200 million and are piling higher each day. The Legislature is working on a measure that would allow Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> to borrow $ 50 million to pay some of the bills. As part of that legislation, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> identified some areas where cuts in state spending could be made, and that included the Department of Culture and History. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said the state's anniversary wo n't go unnoticed. Every year there is a celebration at Independence Hall, and <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said this year will be no different. `` It's too important in our history to let it go by,'' he said.

 Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> argued Tuesday that the company should be awarded government telecommunications contracts worth millions of dollars because a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> employee leaked secret AT & amp; T bid information to competitors. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> board of contract appeals that the federal agency had received information on at least three occasions suggesting that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's price had been disclosed, but <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> let the bidding proceed anyway. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorowicz </PERSON> defended the contracts to upgrade the federal telephone system, known as FTS, saying there was no basis for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's charges. `` The real issue is that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has been the queen mother of the FTS network for 25 years ... it got fat, fell asleep and lost its throne,'' <PERSON> Gregorowicz </PERSON> said. The contracts, worth $ 55 million for 12 large electronic switches, are being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general's office, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The procurement has been watched closely because <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> is also handling the bidding on contracts for an all-new federal phone system worth as much as $ 25 billion over 10 years. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, the only company to bid for all 12 switches, protested after it won contracts for only five switches. It had been the sole bidder for four of the five. <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone companies won contracts for the other seven _ <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> each got contracts for two switches in their areas and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> got one. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T says it should get the contracts for all 12 switches because of the alleged <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> improprieties.

<HEAD>Widow Told That Husband's Body Was Lost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman whose soldier husband was killed in the Tet offensive 20 years ago this month said she has learned the Army misplaced his body for two weeks at a time when she was told he was missing in action. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, who has been researching a book looking at the Vietnam War from a widow's viewpoint, expressed outrage and disbelief this week at her latest information from a chaplain in her husband's unit. `` If they'd told me the truth, my family and I would have been able to put this to bed a long time ago,'' she said. She said she was n't told her husband had been killed until two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> told her he was missing in action. She continued to write him letters, sometimes as often as three times a day, during that period. It was a month before his body was returned home; she was never allowed to see the body, she said. The latest information came from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinsky </PERSON>, the chaplain with Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s company in the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. After reading a Feb. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> story about <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s efforts to finally learn the hazy circumstances behind her husband's death, <PERSON> Hinsky </PERSON> and several of <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s soldiers got in touch with her. <PERSON> Hinsky </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Plainville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said he was the first person to reach her husband after the attack atop an old <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> stronghold called `` Fort Courage'' 20 miles south of the former capital of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The chaplain assured her that `` he -LRB- Reed -RRB- never knew what hit him'' and confirmed what she had heard last summer from several enlisted men: A young <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier who believed his short mortar round killed <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and three other officers went berserk that night and had to be shipped out. Hearing from the chaplain, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> says, was `` quite a touching moment. I'd always wondered who was the first person there. Then 20 years to the day later I hear from this warm and caring chaplain who tells me <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was a tremendous person and says ` Your husband never suffered.''' He also told <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, she said, that `` The Army screwed up. They lost his body.'' `` I ca n't imagine how they could have misplaced his body,'' and then delayed telling her he was dead, she said. She continues to be stymied, she said, in her efforts to secure a copy of a reported full investigation into the fatal events of 20 years ago. Although <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said she's still angry over the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the case, she said she's happy at having achieved so much in her attempt to reconcile herself to the death of her husband, her high school sweetheart in <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. One soldier, she said, told her this month that <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was `` the best officer in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` It warms my heart to know how much the men cared about him,'' she said. `` Now I know that they felt pain at losing him, too.'' Her two children, including a 23-year-old son who joined her on an emotional trip back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> last fall, are `` thrilled'' with the news that their father was mourned by his soldiers, she said. Several publishers, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said, have expressed interest in her manuscript, tentatively titled `` Silent Partner: A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Widow's Story.

 The military govermment closed one university campus Tuesday after hundreds of stone-throwing students broke through police barricades in a protest of the arrest of nine student leaders. The registrar of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Nsukka </LOCATION> campus, <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Umeh </PERSON>, said he had closed the university on the advice of the government. He said it was hoped this would avert further damage. The government radio and <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> newspapers had reported that university students in <LOCATION> Nsukka </LOCATION>, an eastern city, and nearby <LOCATION> Enugu </LOCATION> marched in both cities on Monday. The reports also said that students in <LOCATION> Enugu </LOCATION> threw stones at police. The arrested student leaders will be arraigned next week before a special tribunal on arson charges stemming from student demonstrations in June 1986. Students said police killed 19 students during that unrest, over the expulsion of several male students for allegedly visiting female dormitories. Authorities said four students were killed. A government commission later said police mishandled the demonstrations and a top police official was dismissed.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says that he and his wife of 35 years cope with crisis together because, `` She has made it so natural for us to be as one that we never face anything alone.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an article in the March issue of <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s magazine on his relationship with his second wife, was asked how she is helping him cope with the Iran-contra affair. `` It's always our problem _ to be dealt with as something affecting the two of us,'' he said, `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> sees this problem as something that happened to us together.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she shared that sense of devotion: `` I knew I was in love when I became more concerned about <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> than about myself.'' The pair were married in March 1952, after 11 months of courtship that began with `` kind of a blind date,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, then an actor. `` In case things did n't click, I told her on the phone that I had an early call on the set the next morning, so that evening's date would have to be short.'' The couple ended up staying out late listening to <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> at a nightclub. `` Since that date, 37 years ago, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has been the leading lady of my heart,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Anything he'd like to change about his leading lady? `` Well, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> worries when she thinks something might upset me or might go wrong,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` If she would only realize that nothing important can go wrong as long as I have her.''

<HEAD>Bangladesh President Cracks Down On Opposition As Election Nears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three major opposition politicians were arrested Tuesday in an apparent attempt to quiet anti-government forces before the March 3 parliamentary elections. The arrests came one day after opposition parties criticized President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s plan to use army troops to provide security for the elections, which are being boycotted by a coalition of 21 anti-government groups. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said he would deploy troops at voting places after more than 100 people were killed last week during village council elections. Most of the deaths were blamed on clashes between supporters of rival candidates. <PERSON> Sajeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chowdhury </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and retired Cols. <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oli </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were arrested at their homes in the early hours Tuesday, representatives of both parties said. <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Najma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Chowdhury </PERSON> had just returned from an <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> meeting when she was taken to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s central jail <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official, said government agents also carried out raids early Tuesday on the residences of other party leaders but did not find them home. The government made no announcement of the arrests, following the pattern set when the opposition's main leaders, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were arrested before previous elections. Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> were put under house arrest for a month after their parties led a campaign beginning in November to demand <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s ouster. Under emergency laws declared just after the anti-Ershad campaign began, police can arrest and detain people without charge or trial for an indefinite period. More than 30 people have been killed in violence connected to the opposition campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and Nationalist party blamed <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> for failing to control last week's election violence. But on Monday they also condemned his plan to employ the army for security. `` The army is a sacred institution meant for safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said in a newspaper interview published Tuesday. `` They should not be dragged into politics.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying: `` The government is playing with fire. The decision must be withdrawn.'' A source in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s decision followed an appeal from leaders of parties participating in the polls He spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, a 58-year-old former army general, seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and was elected president in 1986. The opposition condemned that election as rigged and said no fair vote can be taken with <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> in power. The president dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 6 and called for elections to try to placate the opposition, but the major parties agreed on a boycott. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of 73 minor parties, and dozens of independents are running.

<HEAD>USDA Announces Effort To Develop Recreational Services in National
Forests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State and local governments, businesses and private groups are being asked to help finance and develop more recreational services in federally owned national forests, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the move is in response to increasing demands for more recreational areas and service, and to help relieve pressures on federal spending. `` The squeezed budget is a factor,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We just ca n't simply do the job, financing it all out of the federal budget.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the `` Challenge Cost-Share Program'' was authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a pilot basis at a level of $ 500,000 for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. Of that, $ 100,000 was earmarked for the <ORGANIZATION> Tonto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, with the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up by local people, companies, state agencies, municipalities or other groups. Some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be underway this spring and summer he said. Restoration and improvement of existing facilities, areas and trails are typical goals. The $ 500,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> seed money was met with $ 908,000 from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects. One of the objectives of the program will be to provide more facilities on national forest land located near cities. `` We really need to look at these urban Americans and how they can use the national forests to meet their recreational needs,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. What will the project mean to Americans who visit national forests? `` It will mean more camp sites, more picnic areas, more trails, more opportunities for people to visit the national forests,'' he said. Private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds, marinas, ski areas. No increase in user fees is being proposed at this time, but that is comething that eventually will have to be faced, he said. Asked if the plan means opening the door for major private development on national forest land, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied: `` Yes, we are opening that door, but we also need to work with those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall scheme'' for recreation development. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the recreation project is patterned after a similar Challenge Grant program that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> initiated in 1986 to improve fish and wildlife on national forest lands. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> administers 191 million acres, or about 8 -LCB- percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total land area. Although most is in the West, the land is scattered among 156 national forests in 42 states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that if all of it could be put into one place, it would be an area 10 percent larger than <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the proposed budget that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for the 1989 fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1 will include $ 3 million for the recreation cost-share program, up from the $ 500,000 in pilot funds this year. The one for fish and wildlife will be requested at $ 5 million, compared with $ 1.5 million in fiscal 1988.

 Nobel Prize-winning physicist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>, who worked on the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and helped investigate the 1986 Challenger space shuttle disaster, died at age 69. A professor of theoretical physics at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> since 1950, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> died Monday night at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> from complications due to recurrent abdominal cancer, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Elbaum </PERSON>. In 1965, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> shared the Nobel Prize in physics with <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shinichero </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomonaga </PERSON> for developing an improved theory of quantum electrodynamics. The three men worked independently in the 1940s and arrived at the same theory, which allows scientists to predict the effects of electrically charged particles on each other in a radiation field. `` In the death of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>, the world has lost one of its greatest intellects,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBridge </PERSON>, president emeritus of <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and a former <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> president, recalled <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> as `` a towering figure in 20th-century physics'' who was `` always curious, always modest, always ebullient, always willing to share his deep insights with students and colleagues.'' <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> was a member of the atomic bomb project staff at <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943 and at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from 1943 to 1945. During a committee investigation after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, which killed the seven crew members, he emerged as one of the leading critics of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> of erratic attention to safety matters that he likened `` to playing Russian roulette.'' Born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on May 11, 1918, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1939. He received a Ph.D. from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> in 1942. <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>'s scientific interests developed early with the aid of his father, a clothing salesman, who taught him elementary mathematics and read his toddler son scientific studies. `` I grew up with him and I knew him through many stages, and he is just a terrific guy,'' <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>'s cousin <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewine </PERSON> said early today. The young scholar joined the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> faculty in 1945 as an associate professor of theoretical physics and remained there until moving to <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION> in 1950. It was at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> did the work that led to his Nobel Prize. He was also a dynamic writer. His 1985 autobiography, `` Surely You're Joking, Mr. <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>,'' on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> best-seller list for 14 weeks, demonstrated his canny humor and strong like for formality. He also wrote, `` QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter,'' an explanation of quantum electrodynamics published in 1986, and was co-author of the 1963 textbook, `` The Feynman Lectures on Physics.'' He was especially popular with <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> students, who honored him for teaching excellence in 1982. Despite his stature as a professor, he continued to teach freshman physics classes over the years and to ham it up in school plays, once taking on the role of a bongo player in the musical `` Guys and Dolls.'' <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> officials reported that when <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> became ill a few years ago, students and teachers overwhelmed local medical facilities with offers to donate blood. His many honors and awards included <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> award, the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s E.O. Lawrence Award, the Oersted Medal for teaching, the <ORGANIZATION> Niels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bohr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> gold medal and the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> award. He is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Gweneth </PERSON>; son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>; daughter, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>; and sister, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>ADN: Soviets Have Begun Dismantling Intermediate Range Rockets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs to UPDATE with more details of removal.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has begun dismantling intermediate range nuclear rockets stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday night. According to the report, rockets stationed near <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, have been dismantled, crated and are ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Under a treaty signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the superpowers agreed to eliminate the medium-range missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to ratify the treaty. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the intermediate range missile pact, which banned weapons with a range from 300 to 3,000 miles. The news agency quoted a Soviet officer as saying that the `` troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said a group of East German journalists toured the missile base and were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers there. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in January indicated that Soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be removed ahead of schedule, but gave no specific timetable for their withdrawal. The ADN report did not say how many rockets were ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It also did not say if other missiles stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had been dismantled or how many troops were scheduled to leave. The report, written by an ADN correspondent, described preparations under way to ready the rockets for transport. Cranes were used to load the dismantled rockets into transport containers, the report said. `` We were convinced that the last rockets were ready for transport to the location where they will be destroyed,'' the ADN correspondent said. The rockets are to be sent back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by rail, the report said. According to figures released after the superpower agreement was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the site _ which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In all, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the figures said.

<TEXT>
 A defense attorney in the Nazi war crimes trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> said in closing arguments Tuesday his client's alibi was sound and that contradictions in his testimony were due to memory lapses and pressure from investigators <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is `` confused about all of his movements,'' not only about details of what he did during World War II, defense attorney <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said Tuesday, the first anniversary of the trial. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 67, a retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker, is accused of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> claims that he's a victim of mistaken identity. He has said he served in the Soviet army, was captured by the Germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner-of-war camps until 1943. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> rejected prosecution charges that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> invented an alibi. If <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s testimony was contradictory in parts, it should be attributed to memory lapses, <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said, noting that his client could also not remember simple facts about his family. `` The accused forgot,'' <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said. `` If he made up an alibi, he would not forget it. If someone concocts an alibi, you work it out, think it out, maybe write it out. It's very easy to do. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> also claimed his client could not be expected to remember all events coherently because investigators pressured and intimidated him. He said police told <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> before the trial they would `` put a rope around his head.'' <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police deployed a Ukrainian-speaking guard to befriend <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> and elicit incriminating information, but the effort backfired because <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> stuck to his version of the events. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said the few details <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has provided about his whereabouts in World War II mesh with testimony of historians called by the prosecution. He also said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> could n't have known the facts unless he had personally experienced them. In one instance, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> told the court he was laying railroad tracks after becoming a German prisoner of war, <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said. The attorney cited testimony by a prosecution witness who said the German high command at the time gave high priority to repairing railway tracks damaged in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> battle. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lied in filling out a 1948 application for immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by stating he was a Polish farmer. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lied because he did n't want to be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for fear he would be executed after serving in an anti-Communist unit at the end of the war. The defense is to complete closing arguments this week. The three-judge panel is expected to render a verdict in April. If convicted, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> faces a death sentence.

<HEAD>Fed Chief: Economy `In Equilibrium,' But Not Campaign Talk</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Tuesday the economy seems `` in equilibrium,'' but that he could n't make the same claim for presidential campaign rhetoric `` There is a gross distortion of reality'' on trade issues in the political debate, he suggested. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments on the economy appeared to signal that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was unlikely to move, at least soon, on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, preferring to take a wait-and-see approach. There had been some speculation that the central bank was on the verge of lowering its discount rate, the rate it charges for direct loans to banks and other financial institutions, in an effort to stimulate the economy. The discount rate has been at 6 percent since last September. `` The relationships at the moment among all the major financial variables seem to be in relative balance,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Bretton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization that follows issues of international finance. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments on politics, made during a question-and-answer session, appeared to be a dig at the `` get-tough'' trade policies advocated by Democratic presidential candidate Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman was asked by a member of the audience _ former Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Percy </PERSON>, R-Ill. _ what he thought of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s advocacy of strong trade legislation during his presidential campaign `` It played well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' where <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> finished first in last week's Democratic caucuses, `` and it ought to play well with this committee,'' <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, a Republican who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, replied: `` The problem I have with what's going on in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is that there is a gross distortion of reality.'' Were <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks a direct rebuke to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, or more a comment on presidential campaign statements in general? `` I do n't know what he meant,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> later told a reporter his question to <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> `` was facetious. I do n't want to see protectionism playing well in politics.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is the sponsor of House-passed legislation calling for mandatory trade retaliation against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other nations that maintain large surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through unfair trade practices. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has vowed a veto if the legislation _ now before a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> _ is enacted with such a provision, which it considers overly protectionist. A `` get-tough'' policy toward trading partners has been a central part of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign. Asked about interest rates, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said `` evidence of the most recent past'' was in the direction of `` emerging stability'' in the economy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial nations. Economic variables `` seem to be in equilibrium. And I suspect they will stay there,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. He said the economy appears to be weathering last October's stock market plunge, and that he is encouraged by recent data showing a narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit However, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said prospects for buoyant economic growth throughout the industrial world this year `` are patently not great.'' He voiced support, meantime, for a proposal for a $ 75 billion increase in <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> funds sought by bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, saying it was needed to help developing nations pursue sound economic policies. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> told the conference the increase was desperately needed so the 151-nation world lending organization could fight what he called `` an abundance of absolute poverty.'' `` Without this adjustment, there is no future for many of these countries,'' he said. And Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the gathering that winning support from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the increase _ which will cost the nation about $ 80 million a year _ would not be easy this year. `` We're going to be pushing it hard,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said his 3-year-old strategy for easing Third World debt by encouraging new loans from commercial banks and tying them to economic reforms in the debtor nations remains the best appraoch. Proposals that would wipe out a portion of the existing debt of Latin American and other developing countries is `` a path that would lead both debtors and creditors off the cliff,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> contended.

 If you have an urge to send somebody a message in a bottle, <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> can give you some hints. She started throwing bottles in bodies of water 66 years ago, when she was 17. She's received replies from people in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and even played matchmaker to a French couple getting married in June. `` It does n't cost any money and I'm hearing from people I never knew. There was no end to the fun I've had,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON>, 83. Although she does n't drink, Mrs. <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> prefers liquor bottles because they float best. She used to pour her late husband's Scotch into empty mustard and ketchup jars so she could have the empties. She tossed her first message into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and has since lobbed bottles into the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> seas, a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> lake and the canals of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. She does n't recommend lakes: `` They do n't go very far. They go in a circle.'' Over the years about 30 people have responded, many of them young men looking for a girlfriend. A French man and woman who lived in towns about 100 miles apart each found one of her bottles; Mrs. <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> told the girl about it. `` She wrote to him and he wrote to her and now they're going to get married. I was thrilled to hear that,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON>, who has been invited to the wedding. Bottle messaging, like life, is not all fun and games. A bottle that went into the <LOCATION> Fox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, brought a citation for littering from the local police. `` I ignored it,'' she says.

<TEXT>
 The jailed mother of an abandoned girl whose lower legs were amputated because of severe frostbite should be allowed to visit her hospitalized daughter, according to a hospital counselor. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who is 24 and unemployed, faces charges of felony child neglect and is being held in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on $ 50,000 bond her lawyers have said she ca n't pay. A hospital staff member says, however, that Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s daughter needs to see her mother and that a supervised visit may help the girl recover. The child, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, 9, has talked with her mother once by telephone, but has not seen her mother since the girl was found last month locked in an unheated and abandoned <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> apartment. Her legs were amputated below the knee after gangrene threatened to develop into a possibly life-threatening infection. `` It needs to be done in a planned way,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martone </PERSON>, the coordinator of the child abuse program at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where the girl is learning to walk on artifical legs. `` I basically think it would be appropriate for the parent and child to have contact,'' she said in a recent interview. The child's father, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, and other relatives have visited the child, hospital officials say. Others who believe Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> should be allowed to visit her daughter include <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> City Councilman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>; <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack-Ward </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Gary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, director of Project Justice and Equality. They contend the lack of support that mothers such as Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> receive from the system is at least partly responsible for cases of child neglect and abuse. `` We release condemned murderers to go to funerals,'' said <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>. `` We release hardened criminals on bail. I understand wanting to punish the mother. I was angry, too, until I looked at the side of the mother.''

<TEXT>
 Former highway patrolman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s penchant for long talks with young women drivers ended in murder on the night he met <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>, a prosecutor said in final arguments Tuesday. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Orshoven </PERSON> told a jury that <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s practice of pulling women over on the <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> exit of Interstate 15, then talking to them for an hour or more, led to the woman's death. <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> was strangled with a rope, the prosecution contended. `` We know that <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> had a custom, a habit, a practice,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Orshoven </PERSON> said of the traffic stops. On Dec. 27, 1986, when <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> died, `` something went wrong. She was n't like these other youngsters,'' <PERSON> Orshoven </PERSON> said. She became anxious and scratched her assailant's face, <PERSON> Orshoven </PERSON> said. The prosecutor showed the jury a family photo of the vivacious <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>, and then three coroner's photos of the dead woman, with strangulation marks on her neck and bruises on her face. The prosecution's witnesses included 22 women who said they had been pulled over by <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> at the Mercy Road exit, and that he had kept them talking for an hour or more about highway safety and other innocuous topics. None claimed that <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> made advances or attempted to harm her. In his final arguments, defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> contended that some of those witnesses had lied. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>, 37, has already been fired by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, which concluded that he killed <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> without justification. He is appealing his dismissal. <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>'s body was found the day after her murder below a bridge on a frontage road on Interstate 15, the highway <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> was assigned to patrol the night of the killing. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>, a 13-year CHP veteran, was arrested 18 days later. Testimony in the trial ended Feb. 9, but closing arguments were postponed last week after a prosecutor broke a tooth at breakfast and was unable to deliver his summation. The prosecution's case rest largely rests on blood samples, microscopic fibers and testimony of witnesses about <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s behavior during prior traffic stops and his comments to colleagues Fiber experts testified that microscopic fibers found on <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> matched threads found in each other's clothing. A rope found in <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s patrol car also was said to match marks on the victim's neck. There was testimony that blood found on the victim matched <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s type, but the jury was instructed to disregard that. Witnesses testified that <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> had three scratches on his face the night of the murder. He told other officers he fell while pumping gas and hurt himself on a chain-link fence. A <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> officer testified that <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> once pointed out the Mercy Road offramp and noted that it would be a good place to dump a body. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> did not take the stand, but defense witnesses have attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses and praised the veteran officer's professional performance.

<HEAD>Samba Parade Highlights Rio Carnival; Some Violent Incidents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A glittering samba parade Tuesday highlighted <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s famous Carnival, while in country towns, ordinary Brazilians donned humble costumes and danced in the streets. Police used clubs and tear gas to break up a rock fight among spectators leaving the `` samba school'' parade. Three people were arrested and two hospitalized with injuries, a police spokesman said. A celebrant who may have been offended by the sexual tone of a television network's coverage of gala balls punched an anchorman during a live broadcast. Among others, the network had shown a woman, from the waist up, who wore only a silver tiara and said she was dressed as the Statue of Liberty. The last of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s top 16 `` samba schools'' paraded through the 80,000-seat, open-air `` sambadrome'' at 9 a.m., ending a two-day spectacular featuring 75,000 brilliantly costumed participants who sang, danced and pulled elaborate floats. In the towns and villages, the dances were much less elaborate, but in many places local governments provided free street bands. Carnival began Saturday and, at noon Wednesday, this nation of 141 million people will begin the slow process of reopening businesses, newspapers, banks and government offices. Daytime temperatures of more than 90 degrees aided the festive atmosphere. Some costumed revelers ran short of energy and could be seen stretched out asleep on beaches, sidewalks and parked cars. Samba schools are neighborhood clubs, most in the poor hillside slums, that compete each year for a coveted local prize by composing sambas based on historical and folk themes. Each school puts 4,000-5 ,000 people in the parade, who relate the chosen theme through lyrics, dances, costumes and allegorical floats Many of the raucous club balls, which attract tens of thousands of people, were held Tuesday. At the Scala nightclub, a man punched <ORGANIZATION> Nei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandeirantes </ORGANIZATION>, a commercial network that was broadcasting three of the parties simultaneously. Costa cried: `` I've been attacked! I ca n't understand it!'' and private security guards hustled the assailant off. His name and complaint were not revealed. <PERSON> Bandeirantes </PERSON> cut back and forth to reporters assigned to all three clubs, providing closeups of bare and nearly bare breasts, gyrating pelvises other scenes appropriate to leering commentary. The `` Statue of Liberty'' appeared in the Bandeirantes broadcast from the Kittens Ball at the <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to decide what new short-range nuclear weapons to build in view of the treaty eliminating medium-range atomic missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders said Tuesday. `` I do n't think there is a clear consensus in the alliance about just exactly where we go from here,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I do think there is a consensus for the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons,'' but there is no agreement yet on specifically which weapons to build, he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, were among a group of key senators who visited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> last week as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s consideration of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty negotiated two months ago by President <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> The treaty would eliminate medium-range missiles on both sides, but would allow both the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to build nuclear weapons with a range of less than 300 miles. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters that European leaders told the senators `` that the INF treaty should be approved without amendments and that following that, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should procede with modernizing those ground-based nuclear weapons that are eligible under the treaty.'' `` The general consensus was that the allies should not go for the third zero option,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, referring to calls from some European politicians for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. `` They should plan to improve the range of those short-range theater weapons that would be allowed, and not emphasize the modernization of short-range artillery-type weapons.'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, at the reopening of hearings by his committee on the treaty, said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to decide specifically what type of short-range weapons to build. The options include nuclear-tipped artillery shells, which have a range of 15 or 20 miles, and longer-range weapons, such as the Lance missile. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers agreed to build a new generation of short-range weapons, but that decision has not been implemented. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has urged <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to improve its non-nuclear weapons to offset Soviet numerical advantages in conventional weapons. The alliance has long relied on the possibility of using nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet attack. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top arms control advisers, told <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s committee Tuesday that `` Soviet officials have frankly admitted to me that the cutting edge of their political and military power lies in their conventional forces.'' `` They may be attempting to mesmerize the West with nuclear reductions while protecting the utility of their conventional superiority,'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said. Another witness, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, who helped negotiate the INF pact, noted that `` a substantial number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons will remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' after the INF treaty. But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has never had a `` politically easy'' time when it built new nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said. `` Undoubtedly, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> hopes that a new arms control agreement will have a soporific effect on Western security concerns which will weapon <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defenses,'' he said. Retired Army Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, former supreme alllied commander, told the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should build a number of new short-range atomic weapons. They include an air-to-ground missile, new artillery shells, and an updated version of the Lance, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. He also urged approval of what he said are `` low-cost'' steps <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could take, including a comprehensive arms control strategy. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, national security adviser under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` it would be a mistake'' to go along with efforts to negotiate for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Meantime, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the Democratic leadership will go ahead and offer an amendment proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., that would require the administration to adhere to the view of the treaty outlined by administration <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> recently underwent surgery and is not expected to return to work before the treaty comes up for a vote, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. The proposal stems from an ongoing dispute between the administration and congressional Democrats over how to interepret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Democrats want a `` narrow,'' or restrictive, interpretation, while the administration has said it has the right to move to a `` broad'' interpretation that would allow tests of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile program. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> recently wrote <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> that administration witnesses are speaking authoritatively, meaning that some future administration wo n't be able to change its view of the what the treaty means.

 A car exploded in flames about 120 feet from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s official residence early Tuesday, and news reports said the driver committed suicide to protest unemployment. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the driver _ a 41-year-old man _ left a suicide note saying: `` Too young to retire, too old to live.'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard declined to comment on the unattributed report. Police bomb squad officers raced to 10 Downing St. around 1 a.m. fearing a possible terrorist attack, but authorities said no explosives were found. The car stopped at the entrance into Downing Street but did not try to enter the dead-end street, which is fenced off with metal security barriers, police said. The interior of the car then was engulfed in flames, they said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s residence and office is situated about 40 yards down the street `` and therefore the prime minister was not in any danger,'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said in a statement. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office confirmed that the prime minister had been at 10 Downing St. at the time but was not involved in any way. A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> radio station, <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said the driver had been out of work for over a year and had killed himself to protest unemployment. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard refused to comment on the report or to identify the badly burned man pending an autopsy Wednesday. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Evening Standard identified the driver as <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainbridge </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Worksop </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and said he gave up his job as a $ 131-a-week road sweeper 14 months ago. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bainbridge </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as saying he had been depressed over being unable to find work. `` He wanted to work and became quite depressed lately,'' she said. `` He did n't talk much and did n't go out a lot. `` He used to sit in his room for hours looking out of the window, and lately he left his home only to visit the Social Security center,'' she said. `` In my heart, I can respect what he's done and why, but I still wish he had n't done it. A <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokesman, speaking anonymously, said the car had been registered by someone in <LOCATION> Worksop </LOCATION>, but declined to give further details. The number of jobless has doubled from 1.3 million in 1979, when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won the first of her three terms in office, to 2.6 million in December, for an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, the government says. Unemployment topped 3 million between June 1983 and April 1987, becoming one of the country's worst problems. News reports said gasoline cans were believed to have been found inside the car. But <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said police did not yet know what caused the green <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viva </ORGANIZATION> auto to burst into flames at the entrance to Downing Street from <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, the main thoroughfare in the area. `` A car pulled up in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> at the entrance to Downing Street and burst into flames. The fire was put out by <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> and the body of a man was found inside the car,'' it said in a statement. The incident was witnessed by a police officer on duty at the barriers that close off Downing Street.

 `` Broadcast News'' and its stars _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> _ headed the favorites to be on the list Wednesday when nominations for the 60th annual Academy Awards are announced. `` Broadcast News,'' directed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s `` The Last Emperor'' loomed largest in speculation leading up to the announcement at dawn. The two films have attracted the majority of critics' praise and prizes, and each bears its maker's stamp. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> wrote, produced and directed `` Broadcast News,'' a caustic incisive view of how networks report the news. <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> co-wrote and directed `` The Last Emperor,'' the tragic life of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s boy ruler, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>. `` Moonstruck,'' `` Empire of the Sun'' and the year's most talked-about film, `` Fatal Attraction,'' also figured to be well represented among the nominees. In the performing categories, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> was widely expected to be nominated as best actress for her `` Broadcast News' role as a producer torn between a brilliant reporter, played by <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, and an empty-headed but telegenic anchorman, played by Hurt. Also prominently mentioned for best actress were <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, as the widow who rediscovers passion in `` Moonstruck,'' and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> as the vengeful single woman in `` Fatal Attraction.'' Academy president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winner <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> will announce the nominations at the Academy's <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> headquarters shortly after 5:30 Wednesday morning. The reason for the early hour: the announcement will be carried live by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today,'' `` CBS Morning Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning, America'' and <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> Ratings for the Oscar awards show have been slipping in recent years, so the awards can use all the publicity they can manage. Wise and <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> will recite nominees in 23 categories, ranging from best picture to best cartoon. One category will be missing: best original song score. The requirements are five original songs by one writer or team of writers for a single film, and not one film qualified. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> will have a new but familiar home for the 60th ceremonies on Monday, April 11. The ceremonies are going back to the cavernous Shrine Auditorium near the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Coliseum, because the Music Center could not provide enough capacity or rehearsal time. The Shrine, where the music industry Grammy awards were held in past years, housed the Oscars twice in the late 1940s. The television Emmys will also be presented there this year and the American Music Awards are held there. The Grammys are emanating from <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is repeating as the Oscarcast producer.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> announced Tuesday he will attend the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting next month, making him the first French chief of state to do so since <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> left the alliance's military wing in 1966. The summit, to be held March 2-3 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, is `` very important'' because it will `` define the politics of disarmament'' for members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allaince </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said on French television. `` I must be there and, there again, I must represent <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> must speak with one voice,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a Socialist, and conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> have attended summit meetings together since <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative coalition came to power in March 1986. In a television interview Tuesday night within hours of <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s announcement, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said he `` naturally'' would attend also, but added, `` I do n't believe this summit is very important.'' No French president has assisted at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit since 1966, when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, under President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, withdrew from the alliance's military wing to assure the independence of its own nuclear force. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also confirmed he will not reveal whether he will be a candidate in presidential elections in April until sometime after the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. Politicians who have met with him have said he would make his decision known in early March. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who holds a steady lead in the polls, has been widely criticized for leaving the electorate in doubt. Someone, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said, must `` guard the state'' since <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> is campaigning for the presidency. Referring to the recent <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit and the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he risked losing his authority if he were not running and risked becoming too involved in political debate if he were. `` All internal political debate must come after these two events,'' he said.

He charged <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, elected in 1982, had failed his constituents. `` His priorities have been Star Wars, Contra aid, Judge -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, cutting Social Security, slashing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and turning his back on the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oistad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s announcement speech was `` riddled with distortions'' about <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s record <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> faces an uphill battle in his bid to unseat <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, lagging behind the incumbent in both fund-raising and the polls. The latest poll, conducted last month by the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WCCO-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WCCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, showed <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> by 51 percent to 38 percent. <PERSON> Oistad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> has not decided when he will officially enter the race. The only other announced candidate is <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 67, a co-founder of <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madness </ORGANIZATION>, running as an independent. <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, a 44-year-old former school teacher and fifth-term congressman, dismissed sentiment among some Democrats that there should be no challenge to <LOCATION> Askew </LOCATION> in the race for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. `` If you've read the papers, it looks like a handful of political kingmakers are trying to say, ` We'll select the candidate; only one person should run,' he said. `` I've got news for them. There are 12 million people in this state who will have a voice.'' <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> has had a high profile in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in foreign policy and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which last year took him to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to look into concerns about security at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. He has been a supporter of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy, but this month voted against the Contra aid package, saying the peace process should be given some time. Initial statewide polls have indicated he runs 6-to-1 behind <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> says he can catch up by mid-summer. On the Republican side, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is the only declared candidate. On Monday, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> announced he will seek a third term. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, 49, kicked off his campaign with a two-day series of stops. Former <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> city controller <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> filed petitions to enter the April 26 primary for the Democratic nomination to oppose <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, great-grandson of the founder of the food maker H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Historians Criticize Play on Lenin, Stalin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts grafs 1-3 to raise reference to critics.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three historians have criticized a new play that equates Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> with his successor, dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and provides a negative picture of 70 years of Soviet history. The criticism of the <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>'s play `` Onward ... Onward ... Onward'' was contained in a half-page article published Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. The play was published in December and is to be performed this spring in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>, a leading writer, has used the greater artistic freedom of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms to produce plays on historical subjects that previously could not be touched by Soviet artists. A play published last spring reviewed <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s decision to pull revolutionary <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> out of World War I against the advice of many of his supporters. The new work takes the form of a debate among Bolsheviks and their opponents looking back over 70 years of Soviet history at the 1917 revolution that brought communists to power. The historians, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimenko </PERSON>, <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Obichkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, accused <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON> of using <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> as a conduit for his own ideas and treats the Bolshevik revolution as an accident instead of the historical certainty that Soviet theorists claim it was. They said <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>'s play equates <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, echoing those who claim `` that the methods of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> are identical to those of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> starts his roots from <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s epoch. Thus the author unequivocally gives a negative description not of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> alone but the whole period of the socialist construction of this country,'' they said. Pravda has criticized the play briefly before, but the lengthy article Monday was the most detailed and serious rejoinder. In <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>'s play, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is made to answer for the purges in which millions died by his former comrades who also became his victims. But in one scene, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> says that he is to blame for not making sure before his death in 1924 that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> never would be able to take supreme power. The plan ends with only <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> on stage. <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON> expresses the wish that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> would leave the stage, but he remains.

 A somber nation marked the 1,000 th day of captivity Tuesday of journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, but neither French nor Iranian officials offered much hope that the hostage would leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> soon Marathon runners carried a large chain to symbolize <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s captivity during a 1,000-kilometer trek from <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to a barge on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION>, where politicians and loved ones called for <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s release `` It is important that the captors know that all of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is united,'' his wife, <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON>. `` I came here to express my solidarity,'' said Human Rights Minister <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Malhuret </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the Prague-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> and the Journalists' Committee for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hostages </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> all issued statements appealing for the freeing of <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and other captives. The education ministry asked that the statement by the French group be read in classrooms. But the name of another hostage, <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> researcher <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, abducted with <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> on May 22, 1985, was barely uttered. The Shitte Moslem group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed the abductions, announced March 5, 1986, that <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> had been <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, asked that his name no longer be mentioned in nightly newscasts that count off the hostages' days of captivity. `` We would like even more to be close to them, to tell them to hold on, that nothing will be neglected and nothing is,'' President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said on television. `` But it is so hard, so difficult in the face of this pitiless act to arrange that <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and our other Frenchmen held hostage be freed one day.'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, 43, a reporter for the newsweekly Evenement <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeudi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> were taken hostage as they drove from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport following <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s arrival. Two other French hostages, diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, 64, and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, kidnapped March 22, 1985, have passed their 1,000 th days as captives <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

Iranian Vice Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayeri </PERSON>, in a French television interview Tuesday, said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was not to be counted on for the freeing of more hostages. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` benefits from a very important influence -LRB- in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB- that can be used to free Western hostages, including French, but at a time when we have satisfying relations with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Moayeri </PERSON> said. `` For the moment, diplomatic relations being broken between our two countries, no move in favor of the hostages can be undertaken.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> severed relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on July 17 after a dispute over an embassy employee who refused to submit to questioning about a series of bombings in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Never would we have imagined seeing the 1,000 days,'' said <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Odette </PERSON>. `` I never thought myself capable of facing such a test.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer who ran a stop signal and caused an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> crash that killed 16 people pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter Tuesday in a bargain that will bring him no worse than five years in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 33, who was scheduled to begin a trial on 16 counts of manslaughter by locomotive, was operating the three linked <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engines Jan. 4, 1987, when they skidded in front of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train carrying 660 people. The worst accident in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s history left 16 dead and more than 170 injured. Gates was granted the guilty verdict after attorneys agreed to include in the single misdemeanor count the names of all 16 fatalities. Prosecutors reserved the right to ask for the maximum sentence of five years and $ 1,000. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> set sentencing for March 29. Gates remained free on $ 11,500 bail. Despite the admission by <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and brakeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> that they smoked marijuana in the cab, prosecutors said expert witnesses were `` unable to render an opinion regarding impairment.'' Blood and urine samples showed that both men tested positive for marijuana. `` This is the first-ever manslaughter by locomotive verdict,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney and the chief prosecutor. `` This will send a message that -LRB- operators -RRB- can not work under the kind of negligence that Mr. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> did.'' But prosecutors, she said, were not certain the judge would have sentenced <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, if convicted, to 16 consecutive five-year terms. Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said one reason she decided to accept the plea agreement was the recent federal appeals court ruling against automatic post-accident drug testing for all railroad workers. Families of victims, survivors and friends filled the small courtroom, some crying and others shaking their heads while a prosecutor read a 42-page statement of facts detailing the crash and actions by <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>. After the hearing, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> told reporters outside the courthouse, `` I am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence. I ca n't begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families. I am sorry.'' `` The sentence is woefully inadequate,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a founder of <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, whose daughter <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> was killed in the crash. `` I am grossly disappointed that he can cause tens of millions of dollars in damage and kill 16 people and still face only five years on a misdemeanor charge,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, whose 16-year-old daughter <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION> was killed. <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, who was not charged, was granted immunity from prosecution and was scheduled to testify against <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. The statement, agreed to by both sides, blamed Gates for missing two track signals and allowing the locomotives to skid through a switch where four tracks converge to two about 600 yards before the <LOCATION> Gunpowder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> crossing. The statement revealed that <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> lied to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> about the track signals and about his and <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>'s drug use on the train. According to the statement, the first signal 1.7 miles from the switch indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engines should slow down and stop before crossing onto the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> track. Gates had insisted the signal told him to proceed. The statement blamed <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> for failing to replace a cab warning light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over. Either warning device would have alerted Gates to the stop signals, the statement said. The statement also reported that <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> had smoked part of a marijuana cigarette in the cab shortly after leaving <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Following the crash, <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> ran back to the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engines to get his marijuana pipe, which he then discarded in the yard of a nearby home, the statement said. He left the scene while <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> stayed to help the rescue effort, the statement said. Gates and <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> met at <ORGANIZATION> Cromwell </ORGANIZATION>'s home on Jan. 6, the night before they met with <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators and agreed to a version of the events that would not incriminate either of them.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Says West Germany Should Keep Short-Range
Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said Tuesday that a refusal by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to continue deploying short-range nuclear missiles would leave a `` gaping hole'' in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to back up conventional forces with a nuclear threat. Younger also said he hoped <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will make decisions as early as this spring on modernizing nuclear forces following the superpower agreement to withdraw their land-based medium-range missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I think they -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- will talk about it a lot, raise it a lot, but not actually press it because ... it would leave a gaping hole in flexible response,'' <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said, speaking at a lunch for American reporters. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> flexible response strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons, starting with the shortest range, if conventional forces are being overrun. The superpower agreement has provoked a furious argument in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about whether to modernize, or even maintain, missiles with ranges up to 300 miles after the superpower agreement. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's closest neighbor, sees itself as being left uniquely vulnerable to nuclear attack both as the main depository of short-range missiles and the only Western ally within range of similar Soviet missiles. `` By far, greater danger faced by us and by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the huge conventional imbalance _ those thousands of -LRB- <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> -RRB- tanks which are ready to roll across the north <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> plains </LOCATION>,'' said Younger. On modernizing remaining nuclear forces, <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said he hoped decisions could be made at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s military planning group meeting in April, but this might not be possible until the autumn. `` We shall be in a position to decide as soon as we see the proposals,'' said Younger. He said that if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> `` lowers its guard now,'' the Soviets will never agree to the proposed halving of superpower long-range missiles, or do deals on chemical and conventional weapons. His remarks reflected the British view that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not negotiate with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on eliminating short-range missiles unless there is agreement to ban chemical weapons and cut Soviet superiority in conventional armaments. Asked about a recent suggestion by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> rejected nuclear missiles, <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troop withdrawal would `` send the wrong signal.'' It was vital, he said, to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> cohesion that nobody doubted <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commitment to the belief that `` the defense of the Western free world starts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

 The Cabinet on Tuesday approved an ordinance that will give government employees a taste of the five-day workweek. Beginning in April, about 1.1 million public sector workers will alternate between the new system and the old one of six-day workweeks, said <PERSON> Katsunari </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyoshi </PERSON> of the Management and <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The new system will give workers two five-day weeks and two six-day weeks each month. The Cabinet move came more than six years after the five-day system was started on a trial basis in November 1981, <PERSON> Miyoshi </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trading partners, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have called for shorter working hours for Japanese workers. Increased leisure time translates into greater spending, which helps boost <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s domestic consumption and correct its trade imbalances. In the private sector, 50.9 percent of Japanese companies with a workforce of 30 or more currently operate on a five-day workweek, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> survey.

<TEXT>
 Eleven companies conspired in a bid-rigging scheme that inflated the price of lunchroom milk by at least $ 10 million over a decade, an antitrust lawsuit charged Tuesday. `` The ultimate effect of the conspiracy was to take coins from the pockets of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s school children. We find that to be shameful,'' said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>, holding up empty half-pint milk cartons similar to those sold in schools. The federal civil suit, filed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by the attorney general's office, represents the largest antitrust action ever taken against the milk industry and may be as far-reaching as the highway bid-rigging scandals that rocked some states in the late 1970s, <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said The investigation, <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said, could result in criminal charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and may spread to other states as well. The suit was filed against seven major milk producers and four <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> distributors, alleging that high-level officials of the companies established production levels, divided the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> market among themselves and fixed an inflated price on half-pint cartons of milk over the past 10 years. Company spokesmen had little to say about the allegations on Tuesday. The attorney general said the overcharges exceeded at least $ 10 million because, his office estimated, the price of each carton was inflated by more than 1 penny. More than 1 billion cartons were sold during the 10-year period. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said the state is seeking more than $ 30 million from the companies, or three times the amount of the alleged overcharges. If the state is awarded damages, the money will be distributed to the public school boards in 32 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties that bought the milk and resold it to students, he said. Dairy processors named in the suit were <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Velda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Flavorich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> -LRB- Sealtest -RRB- of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s Dairy -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Distributors named in the suit were <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mango </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pierson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locka </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> All four are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We understand that the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attorney general has filed a lawsuit ... We have not been served with a copy of the suit,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, financial vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are aware the investigation has been going on in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and that a number of our employees have been subpoenaed over the past few months. Other than that, we really do n't have anything else to add,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, a media relations assistant for <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, was not immediately available for comment, his secretary said. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> said the company had not seen a copy of the lawsuit and had no comment. There was no immediate comment from other milk producers contacted. The four <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> distributors referred telephone calls to the companies whose products they distribute. `` These companies went to extraordinary lengths to conceal their conspiracy from government officials,'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said. `` The scope and design of the conspiracy made it almost impossible for an individual school district to detect it.'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said the attorney general's office has been feeding data from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> school boards into a computer for analysis for the past two years. He declined to say what prompted the investigation. The lawsuit alleged the conspiracy involved <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties south of <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> and mostly affected the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> school districts. The 32 counties buy about 171.8 million cartons of milk a year at an annual cost of $ 25.7 million.

The walkout had little effect on the flow of goods through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, officials said. `` My understanding from this morning is that boats were being loaded,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` No problems,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for deep sea shipping companies. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON>, president of Local 333 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said his 2,500 members unanimously rejected the companies' demands for the elimination of 750 jobs and for wage and benefit givebacks. `` They have been telling our people, ` We'll bust you.' What does that mean?'' asked <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON>. `` They said they would take a strike rather than renew or negotiate our contracts.'' Negotiations were suspended Monday and no further meetings were scheduled, <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said. Police established a temporary base on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near seven of the companies, which have hired temporary replacements for the strikers. Five firms have locked the workers out and four have not come to terms, <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said. He said the union has signed with nine other companies, and 10 others have unexpired contracts. Officials of the marine-towing companies refused to comment. Salaries for Local 333 members range from $ 385 a day for captains to $ 175 a day for deckhands, based on a 12-hour day with overtime, <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said. He said members' wages average about $ 35,000 a year.

<HEAD>Approval Announced For Expanded Use Of Experimental AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An experimental drug for treatment of one of the main life-threatening infections associated with AIDS was approved for wider use Tuesday. Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said trimetrexate has been moved into the `` treatment investigational new drug'' category for treatment of certain Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia patients. However, because the drug has potentially lethal side-effects it must be used in conjunction with another drug called leucovorin that mitigates those effects. Under Food and Drug Administrations conditions accompanying approval for wider use of trimetrexate, it is to be distributed to patients who have shown a severe adverse reaction to the two drugs already on the market for treating Pneumocystis carinii. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, said that means trimetrexate is likely to be available to about 300 patients nationwide. She said it will be made available free to patients who qualify, with <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> _ a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> _ and the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, handling distribution and bearing the cost. Despite the existence of two powerful drugs to treat the rare form of pneumonia, scientists involved in clinical trials have been interested in the possibility that trimetrexate may prove less toxic for some patients when it is used in conjunction with leucovorin. `` This treatment IND will allow us to offer an important treatment alternative to severely ill patients who can not tolerate the standard therapy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>. Under the so-called treatment IND category, drug developers and researchers can make promising experimental drugs available to patients with immediately life-threatening diseases before the drugs have passed full safety and efficacy review by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. That makes it more widely available to certain patients, but under more carefully controlled conditions than when a drug wins approval for general marketing. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> made the announcement at the start of a two-day seminar sponsored jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to familiarize health professions with the new treatment IND rules that went into effect late last year. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus, now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring.

 Angolan army troops killed four South African soldiers in a clash in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, South African army commander Gen. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said the soldiers were killed during the weekend when Angolan troops fired a Soviet-made anti-aircraft gun at a vehicle in which the soldiers were riding, but gave no further details about the time or place. His statement Tuesday was the first confirmation from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of repeated reports from the Marxist Angolan government that South African forces were still fighting in support of the Angolan rebel movement, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Since the weekend, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has achieved resounding success and FAPLA -LRB- the Angolan government army -RRB- is now retreating in disarray and trying to organize a desperate last stand,'' he said. The Angolan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said South African forces launched a new attack east of the southern city of Cuito Cuanavale Sunday, leaving `` considerable casualties on both sides,'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Tuesday The <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> report, in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, apparently referred to the same battle. The South Africans announced fighting a major battle in November against <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> - and Soviet-led Angolan forces at Cuito Cuanavale, and later reported the deaths of more than 40 South African and South-West African soldiers in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, without specifying where or how they died Since announcing in December that its forces were withdrawing from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has refused to comment on Angolan government estimates of South African troop strength. <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Angolan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as estimating Tuesday that 7,000 South African troops remained in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Cuando-Cubango </LOCATION> province after recent reinforcements. <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported heavy fighting was still under way late Monday 12 miles east of Cuito Cuanavale. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> claimed his troops forced the government soldiers out of Cuito Cuanavale several weeks ago. He said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> now surrounds the deserted town, which had been the annual starting point for the government's dry-season offensives against rebel strongholds in the southeast. The rebels also receive military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while the government receives Soviet military aid and has a reported Cuban support force of 40,000 regulars in the mineral-rich nation. In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying it has allowed the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to resume its activities in the war-wracked southern African nation.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday condemned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` use of excessive force'' against Palestinian civilians on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, its first-ever rebuke of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The condemnation was issued by the 14.3-million-member labor federation's executive council an hour after meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is scheduled to make a week-long visit to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> Feb. 24 to promote new negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> blamed Islamic fundamentalists for `` fueling the flames of violence in the occupied territories,'' but said the Palestinian demonstrations did not warrant unnecessary force used by Israeli defense forces. `` No doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience of the Israeli army in riot control and other police functions, and to the frustrations of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers as they confront young Palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs,'' the federation said. `` These factors may explain, but they can not excuse, and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> can not condone, the use of excessive force against civilians.'' The federation, however, rejected what it called a `` notion that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must now redeem itself by turning the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> over to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.'' More than 50 Palestinians have been killed and thousands of others have been injured or arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied territories since early December. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the labor federation, said it is the first time the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has made any criticism of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> action. `` They have n't crushed children's hands before,'' he said. The annual winter meeting of the labor leaders here was <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s last stop of an extended weekend in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to gain support from traditional friends of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for his effort to soften <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s opposition to entering new peace negotiations <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> addressed a meeting of the B'Nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Friday, seeking help from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish community in pressing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to show more flexibility. `` There's been so much emphasis on the process ... direct negotiations on the one hand, an international conference or some kind of international vehicle on the other ... that the discussion has become a little sterile,'' he said Tuesday. `` If we are going to get going, we need to talk a little bit more about the substance of what might happen.''

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police hunted Tuesday for four men who burst into a recording studio wielding machine guns and ordered about 40 partygoers to strip before robbing them. Witnesses said the bandits were looking for Twin Cities vocalist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, who recently topped the black music charts with `` Fake.'' But <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> was not at the party, which followed a concert by him in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, when the men burst into the small studio in the basement of a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> beauty salon. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON>, a victim and the son of the salon owner, said the robbers appeared to be under the mistaken impression that members of <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>'s band had brought with them a significant amount of money earned from the concert. `` They came ready to rob <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON> said. `` They were looking for the money from the Orpheum,'' said <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON>. `` They came in here looking for <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>.'' Police had no suspects, Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> police robbery unit, said Tuesday. However, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said investigators believe none of the money stolen was concert proceeds. The total value of goods and cash stolen has yet to be compiled, he added. According to Ms. <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON>, the men who broke up the party at 4 a.m. Monday forced some guests to strip to their underwear and others to strip completely. `` We were all deathly afraid,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON>. `` These were terrorists. They made us lay on top of each other naked in the corner and pointed the machine guns at our heads. They told us what they were, Thompsons and Uzis.'' `` Anytime anyone would look up from the floor, the robbers would threaten to shoot,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON> said Monday. `` They took everything _ jewelry, wallets, keys, coats.'' <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>'s bass player, <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON>, walked in during the middle of the robbery and was beaten with a gun until he went into convulsions, said Ms. <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> was treated at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul-Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and released, authorities said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON> said the bandits `` had plenty of time to leave, but they wanted to torment us. ... They were even talking about wasting the police. `` I've never seen anything like this in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON> said he believes the party-goers were set up by someone who knew about the celebration. Witnesses said the gunmen left a message for <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, 34, who went to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after the concert Monday. `` They told us to tell <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> that their children did n't have nothing for Christmas, but they had something now,'' <PERSON> Karriem </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Tuesday it has begun an investigation into allegations that the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has unfairly restricted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette sales in its markets. `` The Korean cigarette market is approximately $ 2.1 billion -LRB- a year -RRB- and is totally controlled by government monopoly,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the investigation. The inquiry could lead to retaliatory tariffs against South Korean products if the government finds that the Korean restrictions constitute an unfair trading practice. The government action came on a petition filed last month by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cigarette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which contends that Korean barriers are causing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to lose $ 500 million annually in potential exports. In his statement, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the industry petition `` raises questions about whether policies of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from open and non-discriminatory access to the Korean cigarette market.'' `` During the investigation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will make additional efforts to resolve this issue with the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, noting that the petition had been accepted `` following extensive consultations between the two governments over the past two years aimed at achieving open and non-discriminatory market access.'' Earlier this month, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government stripped duty-free import treatment from products from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and three other Asian exporters _ <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year ran a $ 7.1 billion trade deficit with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In a related move, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday filed a petition protesting a South Korean ban on the import of high-quality beef, claiming the ban is costing it $ 5 million a year. The government has 45 days to act on the petition.

 Assailants tossed two hand grenades into a crowded Hindu temple during a religious festival Tuesday, killing at least five people and injuring 10 others, police and eyewitnesses said. Police said the grenades were flung at the Kathiresan temple in the heart of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on the main <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. More than 60 people were inside the temple at the time of the explosions, temple officials said. The temple's clock, which was shattered in the blasts, showed the time of the attack as 7:51 p.m. Coconuts, bananas and beetle leaves brought by devotees as sacred offerings were scattered throughout the temple's blood-splattered inner chambers. The victims of the blast were believed to be Tamils. Police, army officials and a temple priest refused to speculate on who might be responsible for the attack. The explosions at the temple occurred just hours after a major politician and popular film star, <PERSON> Vijaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, was gunned down by suspected Sinhalese extremists at his home. Another person injured in the gunfire later died in the hospital. Police said they did not know if the two attacks were related. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has been torn by Tamil separatist violence in the north and east. The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu and form 18 percent of the country's 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pathmanabha </PERSON>, a priest at the Kathiresan temple, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was about to begin the main ceremony of the Shivaratri religious festival when the blasts occurred. More than 100 army troops and policemen cordoned off the area and launched a massive search for the assailants. The police also searched for other hidden explosives in the vicinity. An officer from the army's bomb disposal squad said the grenades were M-14s believed to be manufactured in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Police blamed <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>'s death, meanwhile, on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese organization that opposes the <LOCATION> India-Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> peace accord signed July 29 to end the Tamil ethnic war. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, 43, had supported the accord, which grants some autonomy to Tamil-dominated areas in exchange for a surrender of arms. The largest Tamil rebel group has rejected the accord. More than 45,000 Indian troops are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm the Tamil rebels and enforce the peace accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is involved because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils and its role as a regional power. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, a leader of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mahajana </LOCATION> -LRB- People's -RRB- Party and son-in-law of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, was expected to run as a presidential candidate of a three-party alliance in 1989. The alliance issued a statement Monday, condemning the killings of politicians by Sinhalese militants. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON> was gunned down when two men rode up to him on a motorcycle at about noon and opened fire with an AK-47 or a T-56 submachine gun, according to <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Canagaratnam </PERSON>, chief of the police crime detection bureau. The gunmen escaped after the crime, <PERSON> Canagaratnam </PERSON> said. The other victim of the attack was identified as <PERSON> Upali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarath </PERSON>, an artist, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will attack Israeli targets to avenge the killing of three guerrillas and the bombing of a ship intended to carry Palestinians on a protest voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s dissident <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group, known for terrorist attacks, also vowed revenge. Two of the bodies, of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON>, were flown to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, for burial. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has blamed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service, <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, for the killings Sunday and the explosion Monday on the ferry Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. The ferry was holed below the waterline. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> condemned both attacks but made no accusations, and said an investigation was being conducted to determine whether the events were related. A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statement issued in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> knows that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is not handcuffed. ... The blood of our martyrs will not go unavenged.'' Sultan, <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON> and the third guerrilla, <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayyali </PERSON>, were killed in a car bombing in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, on the southern coast. They apparently were attacked after arranging the sale of the <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phryne </LOCATION> to a PLO-affiliated company for the `` ship of return'' voyage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with 130 Palestinians who have been expelled from Israeli-occupied Arab territories. The trip originally was to have begun at <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the three men were not linked to the voyage. `` We deny completely any relationship between the three who were assassinated by the Israelis two days ago in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> and the journey of return,'' he told reporters. `` We deny any relationship between the three martyrs and chartering the boat. ... We deny also ... that the ship was bought by the three men.'' He said they were `` on a different mission.'' `` We are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite of Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, noble ideas,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cleanthis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlahopoulos </PERSON>, captain of the ferry, said `` several months'' would be needed to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a statement by the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group pledged to avenge the guerrillas' deaths with `` double, swift retaliation.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, has been blamed for terrorist attacks around the world since splitting from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in the early 1970s. He is wanted in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said the slain guerrillas were not members of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, but `` they were popular, active and well-respected officers with whom <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> had worked before he split from <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>.'' Also in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a group calling itself <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squads </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> said it would kill Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> `` as a price for this crime.'' The threat was contained in a statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A man claiming to speak for the U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was responsible for the attack on the 6,151-ton Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>. `` The JDL is responsible for the bombing at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> by telephone. `` This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it.'' The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview Monday from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that the bombing was a `` righteous action'' but his organization was not involved. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said the voyage would be considered `` a declaration of war'' and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would stop it `` in the ways it sees suitable.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s transport minister, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON>, appeared to suggest on Tuesday that his government was behind the bombing. If the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> obtains another vessel, `` its fate will be the same,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We knew we would n't allow the boat to reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. If we could prevent its departure, that was obviously the right thing to do.''

 A new disease-resistant iceberg lettuce, Autumn Gold, may be on the market within a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. According to developer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientist at <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Autumn Gold resists mosaic virus, which causes lettuce plants to have small, distorted heads and unhealthy-looking dark and light green patterns.

 The superconducting super collider, a $ 4.4 billion project sought by seven states, was warmly supported by people attending public hearings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` Contrary to some other areas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who are reluctant to participate in this razor edge of technology and engage in what I call frontier spirit, we in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> believe in this project and this community is 100 percent behind it,'' Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said at a hearing in <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>. Only a few people among about 600 who attended a hearing at in <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, expressed reservations. A union official described the mood at that session as a `` pep rally,'' with young women handing out buttons extolling the SSC and banners and road signs declaring, ` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Is the Place To Be.'' <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> also are semi-finalists in the selection process. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dropped out because of strong local opposition at its proposed site. Scientists say the super collider, a huge atom-smasher 53 miles in circumference, will provide new depth in high energy physics research. When completed in 1996, the facility is expected to provide 2,500 jobs and an annual payroll of $ 270 million. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> spoke near the beginning of a public hearing on the environmental impact of the project on <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Officials said 112 people had signed up to make comments during the 4 -LCB- - hour hearing Tuesday afternoon A second hearing was scheduled for the evening.

Tuesday's meeting was advertised by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> as an `` environmental scoping'' session to explain the project and allow citizens a chance to comment about issues which should be considered in preparing an environmental impact statement. `` This is not a public referendum, but it is important we understand how people feel,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirke </PERSON>, a spokesman for the DOE. `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> needs it for -LRB- economic -RRB- diversification,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Stockbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which unanimously supports the project. He said some property owners who would be displaced are worried about compenstation, but he said three-quarters of the people who attended a recent council meeting supported the project. However, one man questioned whether the project had a military application. `` I personally feel it will be a tool used for military uses,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Grose </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt it would be used for military means.''

<TEXT>
 The nation's armed forces are running short of a critical spare part _ uniforms. The situation has gotten so bad, according to a new survey, that the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is issuing IOUs for coats to enlisted men and women. Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is reducing its supplies of peacoats and blue jumpers at military exchanges to clothe recruits graduating from boot camp; the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has reduced from two to one the number of blue service coats issued to many recruits, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is running out of coats, short-sleeve shirts, field caps and trousers. As the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> stated Tuesday: `` The naked truth is that the military is running out of uniforms.'' The independent newspaper said it had surveyed the four services and found agreement that the shortage could be traced to the Defense Personnel Support Center in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. That center has been wracked over the past year by a kickback scandal involving a handful of clothing companies and some <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` Recovering from the indictments -LRB- is -RRB- our major problem,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zebrowski </PERSON>, the deputy director of the center's Clothing and <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It became impossible to do business with those companies. And even before, our production base was very small.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> appears to be the hardest hit, the newspaper said, with dwindling stocks of all three types of its uniform coats. A recent directive instructed <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> boot camps to issue one complete green uniform to recruits along with `` an appropriate ` due member' certificate -LRB- IOU -RRB- for the coats not issued.'' Clothing stores also have been told to stop selling dress blue Marine coats `` except to those individuals in receipt of orders where the blue uniform is required for the performance of duty,'' the directive added. In the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, men and women already in the fleet are finding reduced selections of uniforms at exchanges when they need to replace worn clothes because the service is giving boot camps first priority. `` We feel very strongly that a recruit will have a full seabag when he leaves -LRB- boot camp -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> uniform official. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is giving its recruits one field cap now instead of two, and last August started running low on certain sizes of coats after clothing contractors were debarred for misconduct. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has been forced to cut back its issue of blue service coats to many recruits from two to one. Those with coat sizes in short supply are being given cash allowances to buy their second coat after graduation, said Capt. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Unklesbay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zebrowski </PERSON> declined to predict when the shortages might be alleviated, saying: `` We're fighting this on an item-by-item basis.''

<HEAD>Scientists Say US, Soviet Nuclear Warheads Should Be Dismantled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of American scientists on Tuesday disputed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration statements that it was not practical to verify the dismantlement of nuclear warheads under an arms control agreement. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION> outlined at a news conference a dismantlement plan worked out earlier this month in conjunction with the Committee of Soviet Scientists Against the Nuclear Threat, headed by <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdayev </PERSON>, head of the Soviet civilian space agency. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Stone, president of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group, and members <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, said they were concerned that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> may have raised `` misconceptions'' in defending the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact. The pact calls for the elimination of all medium-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other administration officials, defending the treaty against conservative Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said it did not require the destruction of warheads from the banned missiles because verifying that step could expose secrets on how the devices are built. The administration further argued that destroying the warheads would free up weapons-grade plutonium which could be used by terrorists. And officials said the Soviets could simply produce more weapons material to replace any destroyed. Although Stone, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippel </PERSON> support the INF pact, they took issue with <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, and proposed a system under which warheads could be dismantled and the material either used in reactors or buried underground. Under the plan, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would each designate a dismantlement site, which would be closely monitored to prevent the clandestine entry or exit of nuclear material, said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who worked in the national laboratory at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> in 1949-56 designing nuclear weapons. Nuclear warheads entering the site would be `` tagged'' for identification and `` fingerprinted'' by neutron probes, x-rays or gamma rays which the scientists said would verify that the devices contained nuclear materials but would not disclose their inner workings. The warheads would then be dismantled behind closed doors at the nation which owned them, and inspectors from the other nation would verify that nuclear material had left the site. In the case of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warheads, Soviet `` inspectors'' would only have to verify that a batch of nuclear warheads had entered a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dismantlement facility and that, after all the warheads had been dismantled and their components destroyed beyond recognition, no intact nuclear warheads remained inside, the scientists said in a statement. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippel </PERSON> recommended that weapons-grade plutonium from the warheads be mixed with radioactive wastes and buried. They recommended that highly enriched uranium also used in nuclear weapons be used to fuel reactors for electric power plants. The estimated cost of dismantling the warheads, about $ 6 billion, would be dwarfed by the value of the fuel, about $ 50 billion, they said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in a paper that `` the approximately 1,000 tons of U-235 -LRB- enriched uranium -RRB- and 200 tons of plutonium in the world's more than 50,000 nuclear warheads could be consumed as fuel in all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear power plants in seven years, or in all the world's nuclear power plants in about three years. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippel </PERSON> acknowledged that the scientists had not devised a fool-proof plan to enable each side to be assured that the correct type and number of warheads were being dismantled under an arms control agreement involving multiple systems.

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation Announces Grants To Spur Literacy Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> announced 21 grants Tuesday totaling $ 1.35 million in its Literacy Challenge, a program aimed at spurring the growth of adult literacy services. The aim of the Literacy Challenge is to stimulate state-level activity among adult-literacy groups and agencies. The foundation says it is the largest non-government source of funds for such cooperative efforts. The <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, foundation, with assets of more than $ 600 million, has committed a total of more than $ 5 million to adult literacy projects since 1985. It has spent $ 2.5 million on the Literacy Challenge alone.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Injunction On Japanese Gillnet Fishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A permit that would have allowed Japanese salmon fishermen to accidentally catch seals, killer whales and other mammals violated an animal-protection law, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here upheld a preliminary injunction issued by a federal district judge last June that halted gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanese fleets in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel rejected an appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the preliminary injunction issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a native Alaskan fisherman's organization to stop the accidental taking of sea lions, fur seals, white porpoises and killer whales that could be ensnared in the nine-mile-long gillnets. As issued by the secretary of commerce, the three-year permit would have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5,250 Dall's porpoises in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> _ including 789 in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The court ruled that the permit, which allowed the Japanese fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took, violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act. `` The interest in maintaining healthy populations of marine mammals comes first and the secretary can not ignore the fur seals. He can include the northern fur seals in the permit only if he makes the requisite findings,'' the court said in an opinion by Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` Lacking such findings the permit can not issue. Moreover, he may not allow the federation merely to pay the price for taking protected marine mammals; and he must face up the taking of other marime mammals the record shows will inevitably occur if gillnet fishing is permitted,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in the opinion joined by Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> filed a dissent, saying the majority decision `` is unsupported by the text, structure, or legislative history of the statute.'' The injunction was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Kokechik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deputy chief of staff said Tuesday some soldiers had committed `` totally unacceptable'' acts against Palestinians, and hospital officials reported eight Arabs wounded by troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> also said more than 200 Israelis had been injured, most of them lightly, since Arab riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He said 53 Palestinians had been killed, but the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> puts the number at 54. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> confirmed that some soldiers used a bulldozer to bury four Palestinians alive near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The general declared: `` This pattern of behavior ... is totally unacceptable under the standards of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and any civilized norms. Whoever is found responsible for this event will be punished.'' Neighbors rescued the four Arabs shortly after they were buried. Young Palestinians set fire to a bus Tuesday, burned tires and built road blocks in the occupied territories and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where a general strike virtually closed down <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> communities and neighborhoods. Riot police stopped a bus carrying Israeli Arab high school students from school in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> to their homes in Umm al <PERSON> Fahm </PERSON> and beat several of them, the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamishmar </ORGANIZATION> reported. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Umm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fahm </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the report to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Police declined comment. Transport Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON> appeared to suggest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bombed a ferry that was to carry Arab deportees from a <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> port to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> obtained another vessel, he said, `` Its fate will be the same.'' `` We knew we would n't allow the boat to reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` If we could prevent its departure, that was obviously the right thing to do.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a soldier punched and shoved an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cameraman working for NBC News. The soldier said he asked the cameraman, <PERSON> Ofir </PERSON> <PERSON> Moradov </PERSON>, to stop filming a protest, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moradov </PERSON> did not hear the request. The army said the soldier was convicted of `` unbecoming conduct,'' but would not reveal his name or the sentence. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said soldiers had not choice but to use beatings in an attempt to curb the riots. `` Whatever amount of force is needed ... is something that in my judgment is forced upon us by the situation,'' he told a news conference of foreign reporters. `` We ca n't easily put the realities of life into a simple set of orders. The situation created during the control of a violent riot is much more complicated than it might seem.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on a visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>: `` We want to put an end to the riots and restore normal life. On the other hand, we do n't want to kill people. ... I hope in the near weeks we will find the most right methods.'' `` We have to handle it in the most human limitations,'' he said, addressing a news conference in English. `` We have to defend ourselves and at the same time continue our efforts for finding peace.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, questioned about the beating policy during debate in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the orders to use force were necessary and `` to the best of my knowledge and judgment, are legal.'' He said the burial of the Arabs at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> `` will be treated with the full heaviness of the law. It's not imaginable that such an incident would happen in the Israeli army.'' <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said the army is succeeding in `` gradually -LRB- improving -RRB- the caliber of behavior of our forces,'' but added: `` We are confronting a new type of threat. We can not afford to yield to it, and we are not going to.'' He said protesters are `` led by a nucleus of activists who enjoy the support and cooperation of the masses.'' `` The organization is on the local, sometimes regional, level,'' he said, and the core consists of `` two or three thousand relatively young people.'' The general, who directed military intelligence in 1983-86, said he sees no quick end to the disturbances. He attributed the riots to `` decades of frustration on the personal, economic and political levels,'' not outside incitement. Five people were wounded by gunfire and 12 injured by rubber bullets or beatings at the Fawwar refugee camp, where about 4,000 Palestinians live near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said officials at <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> hospital. One described the wounds as `` moderate to light.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a riot started Tuesday evening and residents stoned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, who fired several shots and wounded one protester. The military command said it was checking the reports. In <LOCATION> Kabatiyeh </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters and wounded two young Arabs in the legs, the Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said another Palestinian was wounded during a protest in nearby <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. Doctors at <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> hospital confirmed treating three men for gunshot wounds. Army officials reported a protester wounded at <LOCATION> Kabatiyeh </LOCATION> after he tried to wrest a gun from a soldier, but said they had no information about other shootings.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said Tuesday his coalition will survive a split over President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s conduct in World War II, but the issue is isolating <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from the rest of the world The Socialist chancellor, in coalition with a conservative party that supported <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> for the presidency, also repeated his threat to resign if the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> affair is not resolved. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said he will sue <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, a West German magazine that printed a copy of a document purportedly linking him to deportation of civilians in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, where he was a lieutenant in the German army. The magazine has retracted the story and said the document probably was a fake. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will reopen the files on six commandos taken prisoner in 1944 on the German-occupied Greek island of <LOCATION> Alimnia </LOCATION>. `` We have taken the allegations concerning Dr. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> very seriously, particularly those concerning British servicemen,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in a written reply to a question. An international commission of historians that investigated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s past said in its report that it could not prove a connection between him and the commandos, but found the initial `` W'' on transcripts of interviews with the six men. The report suggested that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> knew the Gestapo shot captured commandos. After meeting with Deputy Chancellor <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, head of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> told reporters: `` We have clearly affirmed the intention to have this government continue.'' His statement seemed designed to quell speculation that divisions over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> might dissolve the coalition. The chancellor runs the government and the presidency is largely ceremonial. The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which backed the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general for president in 1986. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> for what he called failure to take a clear stand on key points of the report by the commission of historians. The 202-page document said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, must have known about them and did nothing to stop them. In a televised speech Monday, the president said he would not resign and asked Austrians to unite behind him. Mock, one of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s staunchest backers, said Tuesday the president's speech `` offered dialogue and said clearly he is conscious of his integral role.'' But <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> repeated his threat to resign, saying he can only lead `` in good conscience ... if the working conditions are such to allow me to assume these obligations in a responsible way.'' <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> also voiced concern about the impact of the affair on <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s tourism, economy and its relations with other Western countries. Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel operators are flying Americans to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, he said, adding: `` Our business people can not be easy about that.'' Referring to Austrian efforts to establish closer trade links with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> noted, `` We ca n't be indifferent to the fact that in the whole year 1987 only two government leaders visited us.'' The Soviet and <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> premiers were in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> last year. `` What I really think is necessary for everybody in this country _ and therefore also for the president _ is to try to emerge from this isolation, out of this self-chosen inner emigration,'' <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said it was unclear exactly on what charges <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> planned to sue <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>. Under Austrian law, the president must instruct state prosecutors to begin any legal proceedings on his behalf. <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> published in its Feb. 1 edition a copy of a telegram allegedly linking <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to the deportation of more than 4,000 civilians from the <LOCATION> Kozara </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in 1942. A copy of the document was sold to <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> by a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> journalist. The original could not be found. <LOCATION> Der </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION> in its current issue apologized for publishing what was `` most probably a fake.'' In May, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> instructed state prosecutors to sue <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> for asserting that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.'' Late last year, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> ordered prosecutors to sue the Austrian magazine <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, which published a supplement on the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> affair. A poll conducted for the conservative <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> reflected rising public pressure for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to resign. The telephone poll was based on interviews with 440 Austrians. Forty-six percent of those who responded were against resignation and 37 were in favor. Two weeks ago, a similar poll said 72 percent of those surveyed opposed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation. Forty-five percent of those polled said they would n't vote for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> if an election were held on Sunday, while 34 percent said they would.

 A federal judge Tuesday reset the start of Teamsters President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s trial on labor racketeering and embezzlement charges to July 12, the second time the case has been delayed. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, 60, is accused of creating a $ 700,000 scheme in which people were paid for doing no work at Teamsters Local 507, where he is secretary-treasurer. He was charged in 1986 with two counts of labor racketeering, one of embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the government. Two co-defendants, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, also are to stand trial then. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> vice president and Local 507 president, and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> is the local's recording secretary. At an informal session with lawyers in the case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he was rescheduling the trial date `` not knowing what Mr. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s condition may be.'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> `` should be ready to go to trial,'' whether or not <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> is ready, he said. Pending legal matters caused the original trial date, Aug. 10 of last year, to be delayed. The trial was reset to Monday, but was delayed because of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s health problems and a matter pending before the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> pertaining to defense discovery of evidence. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he expects the trial to start on the assigned date this time `` unless the court of appeals tells me differently.'' Three of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s predecessors _ <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> _ were convicted of federal crimes after becoming president of the union and resigned their posts. Another predecessor, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON>, never had a police record and died while in office. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> assumed leadership of the 1.6 million-member union April 21, 1983, when a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> executive board allowed him to complete the five-year term of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. He was re-elected in May 1986, a few days after he was indicted. Last year, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> underwent surgery for removal of a lung tumor, but his doctors have since declared him free of cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation treatments, however, have caused him health problems, and he is recuperating in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s lead defense lawyer.

 Police and civilian auxiliary officers patrolled near churches, a historic cemetery and in the center of this Baltic capital Tuesday, preventing demonstrations to mark <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s brief independence. <PERSON> Jadvyga </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliauskiene </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic activist, told reporters shortly before midnight Monday that four Lithuanian nationalists were under house arrest to stop them from leading protests. A high profile by police, showing a harder line by Soviet authorities against expressions of Baltic nationalism, seemed to deter any large-scale showing of national feeling. Western reporters brought to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> by the Soviet Foreign Ministry for a government-approved visit were followed constantly in cars and on foot as they visited <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activists and traveled through winding medieval streets to visit sites where protests had been scheduled. Ms. <PERSON> Beliauskiene </PERSON>, a former member of an anti-communist partisan movement in the 1940s who spent 12 years in prison, was one of about 200 people who signed a petition to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in January asking that authorities not `` terrorize'' people who wanted to celebrate Lithuanian independence. Tuesday marked the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s declaration of independence from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> months after the Bolshevik revolution brought the Communists to power. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was independent until it was absorbed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the officials Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> on Tuesday declined to receive official representatives of the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> who came to protest `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in the republic's internal affairs.'' Thirty-two <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senators have written to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asking him not to interfere with this week's demonstrations and religious services in the Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. The state-controlled Soviet news media has criticized similar congressional statements in the past for inciting public demonstrations in the Baltic republics. Activists called on citizens to pray at two <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> churches and lay flowers at a monument to Polish-Lithuanian writer <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON> and the grave of <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Basanavicius </PERSON>, a doctor and champion of the Lithuanian language who died 61 years ago, on Feb. 16, 1927. The monument to <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON> was the scene of a demonstration on Aug. 23 marking the anniversary of the 1939 German-Soviet non-aggression pact that consigned most of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to Soviet control. `` We want to raise the consciousness of people so they remember they have the right to be free,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Beliauskiene </PERSON>, 59, who works as a file clerk in a government AIDS laboratory. Witnesses said one woman was led away by police after she laid flowers at the monument to <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON> on Tuesday evening. But they said she apparently was not arrested. <PERSON> Nijole </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic activist who spent six years in prison and exile for her role in distributing religious literature, met reporters Monday night in the stairwell of an apartment house guarded by uniformed and plainclothes police. A uniformed officer told reporters that if they entered the apartment, they would be responsible for anything that happened to Ms. <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON>, 49. Ms. <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents had attacked her, ripping the buttons from her coat and punching her in the stomach. She said her only goal was to `` honor the memory of the dear <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> people who died for our independence.'' `` We do n't use tanks, we do n't use machine guns, we do n't even use profanity,'' she said nervously. `` Even if they strike us, we do not strike back.'' <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, also appeared quiet. Mayor <PERSON> Petras </PERSON> <PERSON> Staskunas </PERSON> told Western reporters who visited the city that dissident reports that nationalists had been injured in a scuffle with police on Sunday were not true. `` There were no incidents in <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION> on Sunday. We know these emigre organizations want things to happen here but nothing has happened,'' he said. `` We know there are extremists in this city. We wo n't hide it. But they have no influence or support.'' At the Rasu Cemetery, in the snow-covered hills near the center of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, at least 18 policemen in gray coats and fur hats and auxiliary policemen wearing red armbands stood near the black granite pillar that marks the grave of <PERSON> Basanavicius </PERSON>. Bouquets of tulips and a lily had been placed on the grave and a solitary candle flickered in the chilly morning breeze, but there were no protesters. One of the two auxiliary policemen guarding the graveyard's white-washed stone gate said, `` We're here to keep up order. Asked why so many police were deployed on the streets and at the historic sites, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Vilnius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviets </ORGANIZATION>, or local government, said, `` We have a saying in Lithuanian: One drop of tar will spoil the whole jar of honey.'' Police patrols of up to five members each strolled along <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospekt </PERSON>, the major shopping thoroughfare in this city of 600,000 people. About 20 worshipers, mostly elderly women wearing kerchiefs against the cold, attended 7:30 a.m. Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, one of the churches where activists had called for Lithuanians to pray. Beside the red brick Gothic church, which dates from the late 14th century, 15 policemen and auxiliary officers stood guard at the monument to <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON>.

 An American who was the first member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to be extradited from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was convicted Tuesday of gunning down a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> policeman in a `` cold-blooded killing untinged by any remorse.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> native, was sentenced to life in prison by Judge <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> after a jury returned the guilty verdict at the Old Bailey criminal court. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent to killing off-duty officer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibble </PERSON>, 21, in February 1975, refused to say anything during his five-day trial and showed no emotion as the verdict was read. He lost a widely publicized, five-year battle against extradition that went all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> told <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> the shooting was an `` appalling, cold-blooded killing untinged by any remorse on your part, and motivated no doubt by the terrorist activities on which at that time you were engaged. `` You shot repeatedly and at point-blank range a man who was in fact a police officer, though you could not have known he was other than an ordinary member of the public,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Carlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawyer who testified for the defense, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> would not have been convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The evidence of identification would not have been permitted there,'' she said. His mother, <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON>, attended the trial but had no comment on its outcome. The judge accepted a defense plea not to set a mandatory minimum sentence, which could free <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> in 10 or 15 years. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who is of Irish ancestry, was living in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> when he became an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporter and made trips to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1971 and 1974, court testimony indicated. Prosecutors alleged that he and four other men were sent to mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to carry out a string of bomb attacks. A man identified as <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> was leaving a house in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Feb. 26, 1975, when two police officers on a burglary patrol became suspicous and stopped him for questioning. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> fled but was confronted by <PERSON> Tibble </PERSON>, who was off duty and driving by on motorcycle when he stopped to assist the other officers. Prosecutors charged that <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> fired two shots into <PERSON> Tibble </PERSON>'s chest with a handgun. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on suspicion of belonging to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Police, meanwhile, arrested <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s's accomplices, located the murder weapon and found a bomb-making operation in a house near where the slaying occurred <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s fingerprints were found on a road map and other items. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> but was arrested in 1981 by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on a British warrant, setting in motion a protracted legal battle that culminated in early 1986, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 2-1 in favor of his extradition. He was extradited in October 1986 after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear his argument that the police shooting was a political offense, and therefore not covered by the U.S.-British extradition treaty.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>, the brilliant, mischievous physicist who called his Nobel Prize `` a pain in the neck'' and helped shatter <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that cold weather did n't doom the shuttle Challenger, has died of cancer at the age of 69 The theoretical physicist, who also helped develop the atomic bomb during the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project of World War II, died Monday night at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after an eight-year battle with abdominal cancer, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Elbaum </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> professor was noted for `` his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, his provocative mischievousness, his indignant impatience with pretension and hypocrisy, and his talent for one-upping anybody who tries to one-up him,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibbs </PERSON>, a former student and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientist, said in the introduction to the best-selling 1985 autobiography `` Surely You're Joking, Mr. <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON>!'' It was certainly in character for <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> to conduct an impromptu experiment as a member of the presidential commission that investigated the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger in which all seven crew members died. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> initially played down any possibility that cold weather impaired the resiliency of O-ring seals on the shuttle's booster rockets, thus allowing burning fuel to erode through the rings to cause the fatal blast. But at a recess during the comission's hearings in February 1986, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> showed O-ring resiliency was sharply reduced by cold. He compressed a piece of rubber-like O-ring material with a simple clamp, dropped it into a glass of ice water, pulled it out and released the O-ring piece, demonstrating that it lacked any resiliency for a few seconds. `` I believe this has some significance for our problem,'' he said. The commission agreed in its final report, concluding <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s pre-launch freeze contributed to an O-ring failure that caused the accident <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> also wrote an appendix to the commission's final report, accusing <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> of playing Russian roulette with the shuttle fleet and astronauts' lives and of exaggerating the rockets' safety `` to the point of fantasy.'' Born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on May 11, 1918, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> started learning mathematics while still in his high chair. He earned a degree from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in 1939, then earned a doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1942. After working on the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project, he moved in 1945 to <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he did his Nobel-winning studies, then moved to <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> in 1950. In 1965, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> shared the Nobel Prize in physics with <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shinichero </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomonaga </PERSON> for developing an improved theory of quantum electrodynamics. The theory allowed scientists to predict the effects of electrically charged particles on each other in a radiation field. `` The truth was, I did n't really want this prize,'' <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> said in his autobiography, explaining how the recognition disrupted his privacy and his life. `` It's nice that I got some money _ I was able to buy a beach house _ but altogether, I think it would have been much nicer not to have had the Prize because you never, any longer, can be taken straightforwardly in any public situation,'' he wrote. `` In a way, the Nobel Prize has been something of a pain in the neck.'' <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> often refused to explain his prize-winning work, once declaring: `` Hell, if I could explain it to the average person, it would n't have been worth the Nobel Prize.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethe </PERSON>, a former colleague there and on the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project, called <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> the greatest theoretical physicist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after World War II. `` <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> was not an ordinary genius. He was a magician,'' said <PERSON> Bethe </PERSON>, who himself received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1967. `` Nobody could have done what he did.'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and a former <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> president, called <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> `` a towering figure in 20th century physics'' who was `` always curious, always modest, always ebullient, always willing to share his deep insights with students and colleagues.'' Yet <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> took pleasure in promoting his image as a fun-loving man who enjoyed outings to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where show girls `` were all beautiful, and I just love beautiful girls.'' In his book, <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> also told how he demonstrated inadequate security at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> by learning to pick locks on file cabinets containing the nation's A-bomb secrets, which did n't amuse his superiors on the top-secret <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project. <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> was especially popular with <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> students, who honored him for teaching excellence in 1982. He continued to teach freshman physics classes and to ham it up in school plays, once taking on the role of a bongo player and appearing in the musical `` Guys and Dolls.'' <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> officials reported that when <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> became ill a few years ago, students and teachers overwhelmed local medical facilities with offers to donate blood. <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> is survived by his second wife, <PERSON> Gweneth </PERSON>, and two children. Private funeral services for <PERSON> Feynman </PERSON> will be held later this week and will not be announced. A public memorial service remains to be scheduled, a <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.

 <LOCATION> BURBANK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>' decision to tap into the adult film market and shed its role as the maker of squeaky-clean movies is paying off big this week, as three Disney movies rank among the top five at the box office. `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' was the biggest pull at the box office over the weekend for a fifth consecutive week, while the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> film `` Shoot to Kill'' debuted at No. 2 and the studio's hit `` Three Men and a Baby'' held on for fourth. It was Disney's best showing ever. It is n't a record, however. Thirteen months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> was the reigning champ with three films at the top of the weekly box office list _ `` Golden Child,'' `` Star Trek IV'' and `` ` Crocodile' Dundee. The three current Disney films have kept turnstiles spinning with a total take so far of $ 200 million, studio spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said Tuesday, adding, `` It's really a matter of having good pictures. We've been very lucky.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> is quick to point out that periods of glory in show business are often brief. `` This business runs in cycles. We're all just very pleased,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, senior vice president of the Disney-Touchstone distribution arm <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. `` We feel good about what's happening and will try to keep it going.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibiter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which charts the weekly movie box office performance, said the studio should n't be so modest. `` When they take three out of the top four that's pretty darn good,'' <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> said. The studio Cinderella story got its start in 1984, when the Disney movie division was floundering and it started Touchstone Films. Shortly afterward, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> executive when that studio enjoyed such hits as `` Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' became as chairman and chief executive officer of Disney. <PERSON> Touchstone </PERSON>'s first release was the mermaid comedy `` Splash.'' A steady stream of hits followed, including `` Down and Out in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,'' `` Ruthless People,'' `` Color of Money'' and `` Outrageous Fortune.'' Disney also has a penchant for releasing old, reliable animated features. This winter's reissue of `` Cinderella'' added $ 33.5 million to studio coffers and it gave <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> its best winter season ever. `` We've been very fortunate since Thanksgiving by having four movies perform extremely well,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` And we have very high expectations for our films in spring and summer.'' Disney-Touchstone will soon release the thriller `` D.O.A'' with <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, then the animated feature `` The Fox and the Hound'' and `` Return to Snowy River'' before heading into its summer lineup. `` We're certainly at a record-breaking pace already. There are some very good pictures coming this summer, which should put us over for another record year,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Last year's $ 4.2 billion box office take industrywide was a record. `` Big Business'' with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> film `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>?'' and `` Cocktail'' with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> are set for summer release by Disney-Touchstone. A reissue of `` Bambi'' is also in the works.

<HEAD>Five Newspaper Unions Drop Opposition To News-Free Press Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five newspaper unions dropped their opposition Tuesday to the proposed partial merger of two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers, saying joint operation is the `` only way to assure the survival'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In briefs filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the unions urged Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to approve the agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> have requested permission to merge their advertising, circulation and production departments and to enter into a profit-sharing agreement under a law designed to protect newspaper competition when one of the publications is in danger of going out of business. The newspapers would retain separate news and editorial departments. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to `` act as promptly as he can'' on the proposed agreement. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Needelman </PERSON>, in December upheld a recommendation by the department's antitrust division that the proposed joint operating agreement be disapproved. Directors of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, countered by stating their intent to close the 156-year-old newspaper if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> fails to approve the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> and for <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the News, argued in January that the board's decision introduced a new element into the case that made it imperative that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approve the agreement The antitrust division, in a brief filed Tuesday, argued that evidence in the case showed that <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, at the time the newspapers announced their application of the joint operating agreement in 1986, was willing to continue subsidizing the Free Press. `` Whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the -LRB- Newspaper Preservation Act -RRB- should properly be determined as of the time it enters into a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> agreement, not on the basis of decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval under the statute,'' the division said. The division also asserted that <PERSON> Needelman </PERSON> was correct in arguing that the News had not attained a clearly dominant position in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> market and therefore the Free Press was not a failing newspaper. The unions dropping their opposition to the merger were <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Typographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> No. 18; <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handlers </ORGANIZATION>, Local 372; <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, Local 289M; <PERSON> Detroit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON>'s Local No. 2040; and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, Local 13N. They represent employees at both newspapers. The unions said the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> directors and evidence in the case `` led us to conclude, after very careful consideration, that the Free Press is in ` probable danger of financial failure' within the meaning of the Newspaper Preservation Act.'' `` We have further concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is the only way to assure the survival of the Free Press and the preservation of two independent editorial voices in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' the unions said. One union remained opposed to the partial merger. The Newspaper Guild, Local 22 representing editorial employees, vote 349-84 Monday night to continue opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>. Guild officials bargained and then voted without knowing that the other unions had reversed their opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kummer </PERSON>, administrative officer of the guild's Local 22. `` Unless we can resolve the problems that have existed since this thing was announced, I do n't see any change in my position,'' he said. The newspapers asserted that union opposition had been based on the premise that a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> would mean a loss of 600 to 1,000 jobs at the newspapers. The unions `` now clearly understand that the status quo will not be maintained if the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is denied, but rather the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> will close and all 2,200 jobs at the Free Press will be lost,'' the newspapers said. The News and the Free Press have long been locked in a battle for newspaper dominance in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The News, which is the larger newspaper, has lost $ 75 million since 1979, and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has lost $ 100 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western European countries Tuesday for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to eliminate intermediate-range missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met with Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who defended <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear policy at a news conference in the Soviet capital. `` While generally approving the INF treaty, the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries have been acting as though the situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since its signing had only worsened,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, according to a report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` Otherwise, it was impossible to explain the latest wave of praise for the ` nuclear deterence' strategy, plans for so-called ` compensation,' all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochment, and so forth,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The Soviet leader also said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had grown less enthusiastic about a chemical weapons ban, and that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was dragging its feet at a conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to work out a format for new talks on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and other Soviet officials regularly have criticized <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders after the Dec. 8 superpower summit for urging the modernization of their weapons systems to make up for the loss of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 and cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the Soviets had begun dismantling intermediate nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, at a news conference after his meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, defended <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s policy of keeping and modernizing its nuclear force. `` Peace has indeed been upheld in the past 40 years by the nuclear deterrent,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` The deterent resoures available need to be kept up to date, to be modernized.'' `` Modernization is not a euphemism for circumventing the INF treaty,'' he added. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an agreement in December to eliminate their medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as the rest of the globe The two sides now are trying to negotiate a 50 percent cut in their arsenals of long-range weapons. The U.S.-Soviet agreement is awaiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the treaty has been approved by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and must be passed by the Supreme Soviet, which is expected to give its endorsement.

A 70-year-old woman was killed and two others were wounded in the shooting last Thursday in <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION>, a town in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> faces one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Sheriff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> was a crane operator at <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> Works until he retired in 1985, according to <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrall </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. He and his wife, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON>, were granted a divorce on Jan. 11. Authorities said <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' intended victims apparently were his ex-wife and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, who live in the same town but in a different mobile home park six miles from the shooting scene. <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Colony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION> looking for a resident with the last name of Rush. A park secretary showed him where <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> lived. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> broke into <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>'s mobile home with a shotgun and handgun and started shooting, <PERSON> Gillum </PERSON> said. A single blast killed <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeras </PERSON>, 70, and injured her daughter <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, 69. `` Apparently, he believed he was shooting Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> -RRB- Rush and his -LRB- former -RRB- wife.

Vermilion police chief <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> was arrested Monday after <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> was stopped in his car and did not resist. `` It was a one in a million case of mistaken identity,'' <PERSON> Gillum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> were in stable condition Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has begun dismantling part of its intermediate range nuclear arsenal in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The step makes `` an important contribution toward disarmament even before'' a U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate the medium-range missiles is ratified, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. According to the report, rockets stationed near <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, have been dismantled, crated and are ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. ADN did not say how many had been dismantled or when the rockets will be transported back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto transport vehicles. The disarmament treaty was signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to ratify it. The Supreme Soviet is expected to approve it. Under the agreement, the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are to be destroyed within 18 months, and longer-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles within three years. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> there was no immediate reaction at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the Soviets were free to dismantle the missiles before the treaty took effect. The official, who demanded anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets were complying with the treaty. West German government officials Tuesday night declined comment on the report. There was no immediate comment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday criticized Western European countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to eliminate intermediate-range missiles. In a report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments for `` the latest wave of praise for the ` nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochment, and so forth.'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the intermediate range missile pact, which banned weapons with a range from 300 to 3,000 miles. The news agency quoted a Soviet officer as saying that the `` troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said a group of East German journalists toured the missile base and were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers there. The ADN report described preparations under way to ready the rockets for transport. Cranes were used to load the dismantled rockets into transpot containers, it said. `` We were convinced that the last rockets were ready for transport to the location where they will be destroyed,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The rockets are to be sent back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by rail, the report said. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in January indicated that Soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be removed ahead of schedule, but gave no specific timetable for their withdrawal. The ADN report did not say if other missiles stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had been dismantled or how many troops were scheduled to leave. According to figures released after the superpower agreement was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the site _ which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In all, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the figures said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, questioned Tuesday whether fundamental policy changes are taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and whether <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can keep his post as top leader. `` I think we have to be very careful if we assume there are major policy changes,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know ... how firmly seated is the present regime. I do n't think any of us really know that.'' `` I'm not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary of the Communist party of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> who is very different,'' from the past, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> suggest that `` things are not all that changed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. `` I do n't see any change in world domination as their goal.'' It `` should take two weeks, or four at the outside'' for the Soviets to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he said, despite their current talk of a 10-month timetable. The sincerity of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer `` can only be judged when withdrawal is complete ... -LRB- when -RRB- they've left and the Afghan people can have the kind of government they want,'' he said. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who was succeeded by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secetary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> late last year, described as `` surface changes,'' the new look at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> smiles from time to time, he wears much better clothes, and he's younger and apparently in better health'' than past leaders, he said. `` The principal change I see in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is that they are now actively courting world public opinion, campaigning for a favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are getting it,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official appealed to Christian and Moslem leaders Tuesday to help win the release of two Scandinavian relief workers who were kidnapped in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> 11 days ago. Also Tuesday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemned an assassination attempt against Lebanese President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and went straight to a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I asked ambassador <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> to work for -LRB- the Scandinavians' -RRB- release as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. The two captives, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, served with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for Palestinian refugees. They were grabbed on Feb. 5 near the southern <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The agency has blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting individually and without political motivation or links to any organization. After meeting with <PERSON> Turk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> crossed <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line to the Moslem sector, where he held an hour-long meeting with Sunni Moslem acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> at his home. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> told reporters afterward the two had discussed the Lebanese situation in general as well as `` this very serious problem of the two -LRB- kidnapped -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> officials.'' Asked if there had been any progress in efforts to free the captives, <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said: `` No. It remains a puzzling, difficult and worrying case.'' `` I'm indeed hopeful,'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't say that the release will be tomorrow, but I think it's very important for the Arab cause, the Palestinian cause and for the Lebanese cause that they should be released as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said that during a visit to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last weekend he urged <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to work toward the release of the Scandinavian captives. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had earlier ordered his <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> commanders in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to spare no effort in winning their release. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> also met with Shiite Moslem parliament speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement called the attempted assasination of <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> on Friday `` a reprehensible act'' and condemned those responsible. `` The government of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> continues to have our full support,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said. Three <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport employees were jailed after police found a bombed beneath the pilot's seat on a jetliner that was to take <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, 44, from the Lebanese capital to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Assassinations, car bombings and kidnappings have plagued <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since a civil war broke out in 1975. An estimated 130,000 people have died in the violence.

<HEAD>PACs Acknowledge Giving Money For Political Access</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lobbyists for special-interest political action committees believe many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> give them scant attention unless they make campaign contributions, a group that advocates campaign finance reform said Tuesday. A survey of 50 <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> directors and lobbyists found the PACs see themselves as victims in a campaign system that forces them to trade contributions for access to lawmakers who decide issues of importance to the unions, businesses and other interest groups the PACs represent. One PAC director told of seeing a `` little black book'' in which a congressman kept the names of contributors and referred to it when a lobbyist sought a hearing with him. The individual said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have told him, `` Well, I like your organization, but you have n't given me a contribution.'' The interviews with the PAC officials were conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION>, a political research organization that is critical of PAC influence in politics. The group said the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> officials agreed to talk on condition their names would not be used in the report. Among the PACs represented were some of the largest, such as the $ 5 million-per-election <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, and the smaller PACs that give less than $ 50,000 in total contributions to candidates. The group's report said the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> officials freely admitted they contributed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members to ensure access. Some expect not only a meeting but a sympathetic ear. One was quoted as saying that, `` A lot of people think a PAC gives you access. Well, you can get access without a PAC. What I am saying is sympathetic access.'' The PAC officials also acknowledged the frequent practice of giving overwhelmingly to incumbents during a campaign, and then if the incumbent loses, helping the winner to retire a debt in order to establish influence with the new legislator. `` PACs said they felt they were manipulated by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who constantly apply pressure for money. The PACs we talked to said they felt unrelenting pressure to attend fundraisers, that they were unfairly being held responsible for skyrocketing campaign costs and that the public held them in low repute,'' the center's report said. When a member who has received a PAC's donation votes against that <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>'s interest, it does n't sit well, the report said. `` In one case we gave to a member thinking that we would get something and it did n't work. We'll never give to that member again,'' one <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> director was quoted as saying. Some 4,000 PACs are registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. They represent a spectrum of special interests from environmental and foreign policy concerns to farm, corporate, labor and gun-control interests. Election law limits each PAC to a maximum $ 5,000 contribution to any one candidate, in contrast to the limit for individual contributions of $ 1,000. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has yet to approve any of the legislative options it has had under consideration for some time to restrict the role of PACs in elections by putting a ceiling on how much in total PAC money any one candidate could accept, or eliminate the need for PACs by instituting public financing for congressional campaigns.

<TEXT>
 The foreign ministers of five Central American governments on Tuesday prepared for a meeting to evaluate compliance with a peace plan. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, the Salvadoran foreign minister, told local reporters Tuesday the diplomats were to take up verification measures for the peace plan during their meeting scheduled Wednesday. The peace plan, signed last August by the presidents of the five nations, calls for cease-fire and reconciliation talks between the governments and rebels forces of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. It provides for general amnesties and free elections in each country and a ban on all outside military assistance to regional insurgencies. <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> said the foreign ministers also will discuss their upcoming session with representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in March. The region's presidents agreed during their January summit meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to immediately implement the peace accord, but they did not specify a timetable for reaching individual objectives. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced immediately after the summit the Sandinista government was suspending its nearly six-year-old state of emergency, which curbed civil liberties. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also agreed to direct cease-fire talks with the U.S.-supported Contra rebels for the first time. Negotiators for the two sides met in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> Jan. 28 and are scheduled to resume the talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> on Thursday. Cease-fire talks in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> have stalled. The foreign ministers to meet Wednesday are: <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, in addition to <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>.

 Opponents in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> lost a final bid Tuesday night to water down a Conservative government bill restricting the promotion of homosexuality. The amendment sought to limit to teaching in schools a blanket stipulation that local government authorities must not `` intentionally promote homosexuality.'' The House of Lords, the non-elected upper chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, defeated the amendment 90-48, meaning the bill is virtually certain to become law by June 1. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Longford </LOCATION>, charged that the bill, which has already passed its key legislative stages in the elected House of Commons with large majorities, smacked of a `` general queer-bashing campaign.'' Government Home Office Minister Lord <ORGANIZATION> Caithness </ORGANIZATION> retorted that `` gay pride'' programs and the promotion of gay rights in youth clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize homosexuality. `` Young people are susceptible to these intolerable influences,'' said Lord Caithness. `` Activities such as a Lesbian Gay Strength and Pride Week are, in the government's view, at least as likely to glamorize homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as anything a teacher might do,'' he said. The House of Lords can delay and suggest changes to legislation but can not overturn bills approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. Critics charge the bill will heighten hostility toward homosexuals and reflects prejudices of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. She complained last fall that children were being taught `` they have an inalienable right to be gay.'' Critics say the word `` promote'' is so vague it could mean local authorities censoring the works of famed homosexual writers such as <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>. Local authorities run public libraries, some theaters and most state schools. The government has denied prejudice, but accused some left-wing local authorities of using state funds to promote homosexuality as an acceptable way of life. Under the proposed law, complainants could bring a civil suit against local authorities and auditors could also penalize them for misusing funds. In wording gay rights groups said was particularly offensive, the measure stipulated that local authorities must not `` promote the teaching in any maintained -LRB- state -RRB- school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.'' Homosexuality between consenting adults has been legal in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1967. Left-wing councils, including those running inner city <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, boroughs and the northern cities of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, are derided by conservative newspapers for grants to gay and lesbian community groups.

 The aging N Reactor, shut down amid safety concerns prompted by the Soviet nuclear accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, will be placed in indefinite `` cold standby,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The decision means that the reactor, which for 25 years has produced plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal, will be mothballed next year after the completion and testing of $ 100 million in safety improvements. Lawmakers said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to go along with the decision, which is included in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed spending plan for the next fiscal year. The budget is to be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. About 2,600 workers will eventually lose their jobs at the reactor, located at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., said that the ripple effect from those layoffs could eventually result in a total of up to 7,000 people loosing their jobs in the <LOCATION> Tri-Cities </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the decision to close the reactor was a result of a review of the nation's future need for plutonium conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. Under `` cold standby'' status, fuel will be removed from the reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> said. The reactor could be cranked up if the demand for plutonium increases, but a restart could take up to three years to complete. `` The N Reactor has been a key part of our national security complex for more than 20 years and those who have been associated with it can be proud of its contribution to the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> was `` committed to a sensitive, orderly transition. It is the goal of the department to do everything possible to assist those people who will now need to find new jobs.'' The N Reactor is one of four DOE-run reactors that produce plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. The other three, located at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, are running at 50 percent power because of safety concerns. The N reactor was shut down in January 1987 for safety improvements prompted by the nuclear accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The N Reactor is similar in design to that Soviet reactor, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said it was considerably safer. It is operated for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement ends months of speculation about the future of the N Reactor. The decision was reached following meetings that involved <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and the Budget, and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. As recently as December, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials had told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the reactor would probably be restarted this spring. But <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said it was decided that plutonium produced by the three <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors, along with the recycling of plutonium from retired nuclear weapons could meet demand. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who blamed budget cuts for the decision, said they were `` disappointed.'' But, they said, at least the department would finish the safety improvements and not shut the reactor immediately. Layoffs would thus come gradually. `` If there is any good news in this, and there is n't much, that is it,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said they would push for expanded funding for the clean-up of highly radioactive defense waste at the Hanford reservation and also for the conversion of a mothballed <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation into a new defense production reactor.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ who came from behind only to fall back in the final week of the presidential primary campaign _ sought Tuesday to put a positive face on his second-place finish. `` It looks like -LRB- Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have won ... so we've made up a lot of ground here in the last few days,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader said. `` It's been, as I've said for some time, a two-person race. We've made a lot of progress the last few days. We did n't quite pull it off here, but we feel pretty good about it,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in an interview. Earlier, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> blamed unfair attacks for the results. `` If it had n't been for the distortion of my positions on tax increases and an oil import fee, I'd be 10 points ahead,'' he said. `` You should n't distort someone's record. I could do that to him, but I wo n't.'' He pledged, however, `` to straighten out my record. It's not going to take long.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won convincingly in the first major test of the season, beating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 2-1 in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. Polls before the caucuses showed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by as much as 20 percentage points in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> came on strong to make the race a virtual dead-heat as the voting began. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was upbeat early Tuesday. `` It feels good, like it did in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last Monday,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with a home just outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> coast, had long considered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> friendly territory, just as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was seen as home turf for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who is from neighboring <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also benefited from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comparatively low popularity among Republicans in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and suffered from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s strength in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> beat then-rival <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 2-1 in the 1980 GOP primary `` The fact the vice president moves out of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> with 35 percent of the vote in a state which has 2 percent unemployment, a state in which <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is 82 percent popular ... I do n't think that bodes well for what will happen -LRB- for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- down <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s most prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> backer

 You sensed it was over when <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> stepped into the batters box. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, which derailed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` Big Mo'' in 1980, delivered for him in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary. The results dealt a serious setback to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, but considerable damage was also done to three fellows named <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont. For as long and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> continue their duel, the chances pale for one of the conservative challengers to make a serious run for the nomination. The also-rans _ <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> _ finished in a clump in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, meaning none could claim victory even in the sub-contest for second-tier momentum. For one of the three to challenge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, he needed a clear shot as the campaign moved into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. Now it seems certain that the spotlight will stay on the frontrunners with at least a tad interest in how <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will do in the Bible Belt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> chose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because of his leadership and because of his economic proposals and because he was a candidate with 20 years foreign policy experience as opposed to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> who had served only in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a different explanation, one based on personal history. `` He did what I did in 1980,'' he said of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` He won in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and came in and talked about momentum. I did what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did. He -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- came in and started talking the issues ... and I think it's working.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complained, as losers generally do, that his views had been distorted, an indication that issues _ he cited oil import fees and taxes _ rubbed the wrong way for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the conservative Granite State. The memory may linger of du Pont waving a piece of paper in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s face and challenging him to sign `` the pledge,'' that is, the pledge not to raise taxes no matter what. That was Sunday night. On Monday, things got worse for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. And better for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In his darkest hour, with his lead in the polls squeezed to just about nothing and many of the pundits laughing behind his back, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought out the best hitter in the history of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> baseball and the fellow the Republicans call `` Mr. Conservative.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> posed for pictures with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the retired senator from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and 1964 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> standardbearer, stumped by his side and cut a memorable televised campaign ad. He said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` He's the man to continue the conservative revolution we started 24 years ago.'' In the ad, broadcast as a hefty percentage of Republican voters were making up their minds, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I sense a rising tide ... with your help it will carry me to the White House.'' This is the sort of thing that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needed, not only to blunt <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in his bid for a knockout punch, but also to keep <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du Pont at bay. They, or at least those who survived, figured to make their move in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and would have liked a clear shot at the winner of the Bush-Dole duel. But with <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> putting his conservative arms around <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s shoulders, and with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> newly invigorated for his battle with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, there is suddenly less room in the inn for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, du Pont or <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was clearly disconsolate Tuesday night. Early in the evening, with the votes being counted, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said: `` If it had n't been for the distortion of my positions on tax increases and an oil import fee, I'd be 10 points ahead.'' The vice president portrayed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> all last week as an advocate of an oil import fee and likely to cave in to pressures for a tax increase. `` It's unfortunate,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, `` that the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who knows better, would sink to that level. But he did it, he knows it's false on its face and he'll have an opportunity to answer to that from now on.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> celebrated a resounding victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary Tuesday night, declaring that `` the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' `` Last week in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, our message started to shine through and we won a bronze,'' he told more than 1,000 cheering supporters gathered at a restored mill building. `` Tonight here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, our message came through loud and clear. We went for the gold and we won it.'' With just under 90 percent of the precincts counted, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had about 36 percent of the vote. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who grabbed the first two spots in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, were battling it out for second. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who will take his campaign <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Wednesday, sought to put to rest questions about his strategy for the region. `` The fact of the matter is, I do n't have a Southern strategy,'' he said. `` I do n't have a Northern strategy or a Western strategy. I have an American strategy.'' He said, `` We believe in the kind of politics where you say the same thing wherever you go in this country ... The people of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> are not voting for a zip code, they're voting for a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' As a Northeastern liberal, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faces his stiffest test in the Southern states. But as the Democrat with the biggest campaign warchest, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been able to send a plethora of staff to the region. He is working particularly hard in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with its Jewish population _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> is Jewish _ in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, viewed as the capital of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he is seeking the Hispanic vote.

 Among the also-rans, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> failed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to extract themselves from the bottom of the seven-man Democratic heap, but <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s slow-but-improved showing on the Republican side Tuesday gave him cause for hope None of the last-tier candidates was counting himself out as votes from the nation's first primary rolled in. But in the days to come, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> still could send a few candidates packing before Super Tuesday rolls around March 8. Proving that in politics all things are relative, <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who was running fourth in the five-man Republican field, said: `` This has been a terrific evening for us here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' He had finished fifth in a six-man field _ before the withdrawal of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> _ in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses a week earlier. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s showing was just shy of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and ahead of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, according to partial returns. All three trailed front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his main rival, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. For the Democrats, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> edged out <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Ahead of them were <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, each of whom had solid organizations awaiting them in the South. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> were in the strong second tier behind winner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who won <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> when he ran in 1984 but whose candidacy has failed to catch fire since he re-entered the 1988 race, called his meager showing at the bottom of the Democratic pack this time `` disappointing ... but not discouraging.'' The former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator said he expects to be a candidate `` as far ahead in the future as I can see'' but he was pragmatic about the need to start picking up some solid support that would translate into the dollars and delegates needed to win nomination. `` I understand that there are standards that have to be met in terms of delegates and votes,'' he said. `` It will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine if I can put together a viable candidacy.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who had said prior to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary that its voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy, insisted he was n't ready to start planning his funeral just yet. `` I'm going to move on for a couple of days to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a couple of days and call and talk to my supporters all over the country and ask them this question: How ... can we keep this reform movement alive?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> on Tuesday night and discussed getting his support. `` Our message has tremendous overlap ... I hope that in time we will work out some common ground in terms of our politics,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> failed to repeat his dramatic second-place showing from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, but had never claimed he'd sweep <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He had better prospects in sight in the South and plenty of money on hand to propel him forward. One of the also-rans from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses never even made it as far as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> last week bowed out and threw his support to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Tuesday denied <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspaper reports linking high-ranking Honduran military officers to Colombian cocaine traffickers. `` I am the principal and highest official of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and I totally disavow this situation that has appeared in the newspapers of my country,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said during a news conference in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> called the stories `` very imaginative and inventive.'' President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> on Tuesday called the reports and effort to discredit his government and said he summoned <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> on Monday to clarify the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s position on the matter. The reports, <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said, constitute a campaign `` to discredit the armed forces and my government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the narcotraffickers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Feb. 11 that high Honduran military officials had become involved with a powerful Honduras-based narcotics trafficker, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, in shipping cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The article cited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administraton and support among voters who chose a candidate at the last minute helped him recover from his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> debacle and win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary, polls said Tuesday. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' political organization and his performance as governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> helped bring about his strong primary victory, the exit polls said. While pre-election polls had indicated an extremely tight race between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, voters who made up their minds in the final days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> race selected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pollsters said. `` The polls had it neck-and-neck, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is winning by more than that,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, a polling consultant for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reason is that the late deciders were going to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' One possible reason was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s organization. CBS News found there was a substantially higher proportion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voters who had been contacted directly by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign than <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supporters who had heard from the senator's campaign. `` I think the thing that won it for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his organization,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, the CBS polling chief. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after leading strongly in public opinion polls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, saw his advantage melt away after he finished third in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses Feb. 8, beaten by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Late polls showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> halt; one by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Sunday and Monday gave him a slim 4-point lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` We said he had a small lead, and that's what it looks like,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polls found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s government experience weighed in his favor. A third of Republicans told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> that experience was the most important factor in their vote, and 54 percent of them voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to 37 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among Republicans who said they were chiefly looking for a strong leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But that group made up a smaller share of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote, 19 percent, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Los Angeles Times found that a sizable portion of Republicans in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> favored the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, more so than was the case among <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Republicans, and they predomninantly supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said Times polling chief I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` People think of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as someone just representing whatever <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does, and they like that,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` Identification with with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration clearly helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION>, of CBS. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is popular and the people who like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fairly strongly.'' Moreover, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing well because of his long and solid support here,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He said his poll indicated that almost half of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters decide last year to vote for the vice president. But many final decisions were made virtually at the last minute: Of just over 1,000 Republicans surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> as they left the polls, 46 percent said they had decided on a candidate after the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and 32 percent said they decided in the last three days of the campaign. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> found that voters who decided in the last few days went predominantly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as did those who decided more than three weeks ago. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was winning early and late and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was winning in the middle,'' immediately after his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll found that 14 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters made their final decision on primary day, and they went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 36 percent to 29 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Those who decided during the weekend, 11 percent of the total by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s measure, also went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 44 percent to 31 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also found that one potential trouble area for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never developed: While half the Republicans believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew more than he was saying about the Iran-Contra affair, only a fifth thought it mattered, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said. Decisions also were made late among Democrats; 38 percent said they chose their candidate in the last three days. Support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was broad _ he won among liberals, moderates and conservatives alike, according to an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> exit poll. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found that 42 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters had been contacted by the governor's campaign workers, while the other campaigns contacted only a third of their voters. It also found that 55 percent of the Democratic voters gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and excellent or above average rating as governor of neighborhing <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and 59 percent of them voted for him. The margin of sampling error for the polls was about 3 percent.

The plot is preposterous, the acting spotty, the music overdone, the love scenes embarrassing, the special effects fakey. And after investing eight hours _ two hours a night, Sunday through Wednesday, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> _ everything is tied up neatly at the end, not through any clever plot twist, but because of an act of God.

But it's the villains who get the best of the miniseries _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhys-Davies </PERSON> as jealous <PERSON> Quillan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornt </PERSON>, longtime <ORGANIZATION> Noble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rival, and <PERSON> Khigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Diegh </PERSON>, the most fun of all as Four Finger Wu, a wily bandit who operates from a junk in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> harbor, cuffing his honest son into helping toss hapless henchman overboard. The miniseries was shot in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and on location in exotic <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. As the miniseries opens, <PERSON> Dunross </PERSON> is becoming the new tai-pan, or boss, of <ORGANIZATION> Noble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a huge Hong Kong-based trading company. He has inherited a financial mess from his predecessor -LRB- <PERSON> Denholm </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> -RRB- and must struggle to keep the company from going under. To that end, he entertains a merger offer by a Linc's company, <ORGANIZATION> Par-Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. Enter Linc, accompanied by <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, come to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to cut a deal. Talk about your ugly Americans _ during their brief stay, banks fail, stock markets plunge, fires rage, buildings collapse, and murders are most foul. Anybody with a lick of sense would skedaddle back to the <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and chalk it up to poor junket planning. And a people who place so much emphasis on joss _ as the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> must, since the word turns up several times a night _ would surely notice that these two have n't exactly brought a ray of sunshine to their happy port city. Shortly after <PERSON> Linc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> arrive, <PERSON> Linc </PERSON> secretly meets with <PERSON> Gornt </PERSON>, who entices <PERSON> Linc </PERSON> with a possible joint raid on the Noble House. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, in the meantime, is linking up with <PERSON> Ian </PERSON>. Everyone remains irritatingly pleasant in between natural disasters. Also in the meantime, bandits play keep-away with a stolen, broken half-coin that figures in an inscrutable ancient tradition entitling the bearer to a lucrative `` favor'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Noble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Though the plot is supposed to take place over a few days, it seems like years. Time passage is such a problem that at one point, the characters have to explain in dialogue what has happened when and remark how it all seems so long ago. For viewers, it will all seem so long ago, too. `` Noble House'' is n't good enough to be good, or even bad enough to be good. As a four-hour junk-TV snack, maybe. But for anyone willing to invest eight hours _ good joss.

<HEAD>Is Full Employment Here?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To the surprise of those who believed an economic downturn would be under way by now, the number of people with jobs is at an all-time high, generating concern of an entirely different sort. The new concern, finding expression among popular economists, is that the nation's full-employment level might be approaching, and with it the possibility of rising wages. In short: inflation. As with all economic fears, this too could evaporate. But there exists some statistical evidence to suggest that a long period of wage stability could be nearing an end if the economic expansion continues. In theory, the approach of full employment means upward pressure on wages and a need to rely on less-skilled workers, which combine to lower productivity and force prices higher. More than 114 million civilians were employed in January 1988, more than 5 million above the figure for January 1986. While the labor force has risen in that time, the jobless rate has fallen to 5.8 percent from 6.7 percent. The so-called full employment level _ in which all who are willing and able to work have jobs, other than for those who are between jobs _ is difficult to forecast, since it reveals itself mainly in labor shortages and rising wages. Viewing various sets of statistics, economist <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> bank-holding company, believes full employment has n't been reached, `` given the modest gains in wages relative to inflation.'' Various reasons are offered for the absence of strong wage gains, such as a decline in the level of unionism and a tendency for workers to be older and more experienced, and already at peak earnings. But, says <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, such explanations make little difference. `` It merely means that the full-employment rate has not yet been reached and, therefore, is not yet a source of inflationary pressure.'' Those who place their faith in quarterly economic surveys by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> are less certain that full employment is still a distance away. That survey, released this week, shows very strong hiring plans among that organization's 500,000 members. Coupled with already record-high employment levels, such intentions could be interpreted as spelling trouble. Dean <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of business, who conducts the survey, found 23 percent of firms had job openings in the final quarter of 1987, and that 19 percent plan to raise employment in the current quarter. `` These are the strongest hiring plans recorded since 1978 on a seasonally adjusted basis,'' he said, noting that the intent to add workers was especially strong in manufacturing, with 28 percent of such companies planning to hire. The same survey suggested that wage pressure has begun showing up, with 23 percent of all companies reporting higher labor costs in the final quarter of 1987. Simultaneously, the survey showed what <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> termed a surprising 5 percentage-point jump in plans to raise compensation, bringing to almost one-quarter the number of companies with such plans. He reasons that, `` The rather large jump in plans to increase compensation may be an early indication that the long-expected problems on the wage front may have finally arrived.'' Partly as a consequence, the percent of companies planning to raise prices jumped 6 points to 27 percent of all companies. That increase was the highest recorded for January in three years.

 They're married, but not married. They're divorced, but not divorced That's the paradoxical plight of thousands of religiously observant Jewish women in broken marriages. Although civilly divorced, the man wo n't grant a religious bill of divorcement, called a `` get.'' Only the man can do that under Jewish law, as observed in Conservative and <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, and if he does n't, that leaves her in an ambiguous state, her marriage ended civilly, but still binding her religiously. `` She's in a limbo, neither married, nor unmarried,'' says <PERSON> Benita </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle-Almeleh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who has done special research into the problem, urging rabbinical action to remedy it. In such circumstances, she points out, the woman is `` not free to remarry, to pick up the pieces and go on with her life. Her marriage has been dissovled but not dissolved.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gayle-Almeleh </PERSON> estimates at least 35,000 Jewish women across the country are trapped in that situation, 15,000 of them in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state alone. `` They're in a terrible predicament,'' she said in an interview, maintaining that the problem has reached crisis proportions. Jewish law requires no religious release for men to remarry, but does for women. `` It has a tremendous impact on the entire family in trying to raise and socialize children. It's a continuous irritant and cause of tension. It has the built-in possibility of a continually fractured family.'' She said men withhold the religious `` get'' for various reasons, sometimes for emotional, financial or other blackmail to gain concessions about property or child custody. `` This happens plenty of times,'' she said. `` In essence, it's extortion. She said the possibility of a religious divorce `` is dangled in front of the aggrieved spouse'' to meet various demands. In other cases, she said women ca n't obtain religious divorces because the former husband is simply neglectful, lazy, refuses it in vindictiveness after the breakup, drops out of sight or some fluke of cirumstances. Without a `` get,'' the civilly divorced woman under Jewish law is termed an `` agunah,'' or `` anchored wife,'' not free to remarry since further sexual union would be considered adulterous and any offspring would be `` mamzerim'' or `` bastards,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gayle-Almeleh </PERSON> said. `` Such children are forbidden to marry other Jews, and to this day, they carry a terrible social stigma.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gayle-Almeleh </PERSON>, program specialist in <ORGANIZATION> AJC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and coordinator of its Women of Faith program, said `` this painful religious problem demands creative and immediate action.'' She commended the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabbis </ORGANIZATION> for a recent resolution urging sanctions against any former spouse who refuses to provide a `` get'' after a civil divorce if the woman wants one. Such sanctions would involve denial of synagogue membership privileges such as the honor of being called to read the Torah. Mrs. <PERSON> Gayle-Almeleh </PERSON> called the action a `` positive step,'' but said the likelihood was that if a man had refused to supply a `` get'', he `` may well be beyond the point of caring. `` For anyone willing to flout community morals this way, his being called to read the Torah probably does n't make a big difference,'' she said. However, she said the system `` may be effective in some few instances.'' The board also recommended that all rabbis urge couples to sign prenuptial agreements saying that in event of civil divorce, both partners will cooperate in arranging for a `` get.'' That, however, would n't solve prior situations. She also cited drawbacks to a recently recently enacted <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> legislation saying a Jewish husband who filed for civil divorce must also grant his wife a `` get'' if she wanted it. She said the constitutionality of the law has been questioned as on the `` slippery slope of church-state entanglement,'' and it's also questionable if Jewish law should be subjected to legal systems and courts in 50 states Furthermore, she said that such legislation, `` puts the burden on women to get the state to compel relief. It would require emotional time-consuming and costly litigation,'' an `` unacceptable route'' for many women. In Reform Judaism, a civilly divorced woman does n't also need a religious divorce to remarry, but it is required in Conservative and Orthodox branches. `` It's one of the few instances in which Jewish law is rife with the possibility of mischief,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gayle-Almeleh </PERSON> said. In a recent address on the problem to a woman's conference in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, she said that through the centuries, rabbis have made various efforts to temper `` the one-sidedness of biblical law'' on the matter. She said attempts have been made to `` get around the dictum that only a man has the right to divorce -LRB- religiously -RRB-,'' but nevertheless, a religious divorce is never granted `` in the absence of, or without the consent of, the husband.''

 <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>, with two toddlers of her own, feels at home when she's working on the set of her new NBC comedy series, `` Day by Day.'' In the new series, getting a tryout on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> and on-screen husband <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> give up their jobs to stay home and run a day-care center. She was a lawyer, and he was a stockbroker, and they feel a need to devote more time to their new baby than they did to their teen-age son. One of the show's creators is <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> -LRB- `` Family Ties'' -RRB-. `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said I was in his mind from the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>. `` I knew him, because he produced ` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.' I did n't know, however, if I was the only candidate or one of many. He wondered why I was so tentative. I told him, ` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, I do n't know how many people you're seeing, but I'd really love to be in it.' He said, ` You are it. There's no one else.' `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> says it's the story of his own life. He's wanted to do this for several years. When he was a struggling writer in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> he and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> had their first child. They ran a day care center at home. It's a situation filled with such comedy.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> was also responsible for getting a child-care center built at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, where the show is filmed. <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> frequently brings her two children, <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nellist </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Margit </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>, 8 months. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is going all out to launch `` Day by Day.'' It will be telecast this Monday and Thursday, then begin its regular schedule on Sunday, March 6, replacing `` My Two Dads,'' which will temporarily become a roving `` designated hitter'' on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> schedule. `` Sophie sometimes plays on the set with the kids before we start work,'' <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> said. `` When it's time to start filming, up goes her hand and she says, ` I'm not in this!' Which makes me very happy. At home she can work her father's computer and is teaching herself to read.'' She and her husband, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Strand </PERSON>, a computer systems analyst, live in <LOCATION> Ojai </LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. She commutes by limousine. `` I take a little nap in the car and when I get home I'm refreshed,'' she said <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> starred for five years as reporter <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>,'' and after that was in the TV movie `` Baby Girl Scott'' and the miniseries `` Nutcracker: Money, Murder and Madness.'' `` I have n't done a lot since ` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>,' but it was by choice because I had two children,'' she said. `` Then six months ago I did a play and it whetted my appetite to get back to work.'' She says it was her frequent appearance on `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' that led to her casting in `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.'' `` Being a guest star, I thought, was the easiest thing in the world,'' she said. `` I could do some shopping, run errands. In a series I'm there all the time. When I was a guest star I did n't realize that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> was in almost every scene `` One show was based on ` All About Eve,''' she said. `` I come in all innocent and take over Sue <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Nivens </PERSON>' job. I was Eve <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> to her <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> was nominated for an Emmy for that show.'' She was a guest on such shows as `` Doc,'' `` M-A-S-H'' and `` The Rockford Files,'' and most of producer <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s shows, such as `` Streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'' and `` <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.'' `` Those were great shows for the actors,'' she said. `` You could get in <LOCATION> Quinn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>'s repertory company and do his shows. Those were great parts. You were the murderer. I thought then I'd never do a series. All of the good parts went to the guest stars. Things have changed so much now. Look at ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law' with its wonderful parts for the regulars.'' `` Day by Day'' has 12 children, five of whom have speaking roles. `` They saw 600 children,'' she said, `` and interviewed them apart from their parents. The two key questions were ` Do you want to do this?' and ` Do you want to do this many different ways?' We wanted kids who wanted to do it, not those whose parents were pushing them. We got kids who want to be here.'' <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> relaxes by weaving, knitting, spinning and doing needlework. `` I do n't have much time right now,'' she said. `` But it's so relaxing. It shuts out the world. I weave a lot of fabrics, but I ca n't bear to part with them. I think if I make them into children's clothes they'll get dirty.''

 It's a still night on <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> Street when a dozen cops, guns drawn, spill from a dark van and race up to a two-story brick house. A 280-pound narc aims an iron battering ram at the door. Shouts break the silence: `` Police officers! Search warrant!'' Running footsteps rumble inside. The door is down in 35 seconds, and police flood in. Three minutes later, six people are handcuffed. The search for drugs begins, with officers lifting ceiling panels, rummaging in drawers, shaking a Virgin Mary statue. It's another night in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s war against crack, another raid against potent chunks of cocaine that have snuffed out lives, destroyed families, clogged courts and jails and created an epidemic some say may be the worst in the nation. `` Crack is like a cancer,'' says <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficano </PERSON>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> raid, police say, netted three arrests, two ounces of crack, which fell out of one suspect's pants leg, and more than $ 1,000 in cash. Scenes like this occur round-the-clock in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Since Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> announced a new assault on crack more than two months ago, police average a dozen raids a day. Hundreds have been arrested. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in drugs have been seized. `` I think it's at a war stage _ us against them,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON>. `` If we do n't clean up the drugs, they'll take over. We ca n't turn the city over to the criminal element. `` I think the community needs to know we're doing something,'' he added. The high-profile raids are aimed to show just that. The early focus has been on crack houses and small-time operators to show citizens as much as traffickers that police mean business. `` We attacked the visible part first ... to get public awareness,'' said Commander <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, who oversees the police department's narcotics unit. He said larger traffickers will be targeted next. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s crack problem is staggering. According to police, state and federal officials: _ Up to 40,000-50 ,000 people in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and the surrounding area have a $ 50-a-day crack habit, totaling more than $ 900 million a year _ On a given day, about 1,300 crack houses are operating in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Thousands more dealers work street corners or other locations. _ Cocaine-related emergency room visits to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> hospitals increased seven-fold from the last half of 1984 to the first half of 1987. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, by comparison, the increase in such visits was about 2 -LCB- times. _ The practice of trading sex for crack is believed largely responsible for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s huge increase in a penicillin-resistant strain of gonorrhea _ from 15 cases in 1985 to 2,344 last year. Statistics, however, can not capture the mind-boggling brutality that pervades the lives of crack dealers and addicts. Horror stories are endless: a teen-age woman involved in a crack dispute is branded 20 times with a heated potato masher then shot, the gun barrel pressed against her forehead; a baby dies of drug intoxication after nursing at her cocaine-using mother's breast; crack users sell their food stamps, beds, even protective bars on their windows for another piece of the precious rock. `` You'll sell your mama, you'll sell your daddy,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` You'll steal, you'll break into cars, you'll prostitute. It's called the glass pimp You wo n't eat. You wo n't sleep. That's how addicting it is.'' Many cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, have crack problems. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON>, special agent-in-charge of the local <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> office, believes <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> may be the worst. He attributes the problem to an explosive combination: hard economic times, access to guns, 5,000 to 10,000 abandoned buildings, lack of opportunities for teen-agers _ and a per capita murder rate that in 1985 and'86 was the worst in the nation. In 1987, there were 645 homicides, three fewer than the year before, police said. <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> estimates 60-65 percent of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s killings are drug-related. Some people have become frustrated. Two men recently admitted setting fires last fall at an alleged crack house in an attempt to drive dealers from their neighborhood. They've been charged with arson. One of the two said the community supported them and noted `` it was like a neighborhood project.'' Other people are simply frightened. `` The neighbors are scared to death. They're all running for cover,'' <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON> said. `` Very definitely, it's out of hand.'' Violence and crack feed on one other. Crack, a blend of cocaine and baking soda, boiled and dried and broken into rocks, can take effect in 10 seconds. It can create a false sense of confidence, making users do crazy things. One man stabbed two relatives dozens of times, then took money from one of the victims and spent it on crack, police said. `` You sniff cocaine and you rise to the top of the mountain,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` You smoke crack, you shoot to the top. ... You've got to pull them off the ceilings to lock them up. Crack is popular in the inner city because rocks cost as little as $ 5 or $ 10. And while <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is the main marketplace, trade has expanded into the suburbs. Sheriff <PERSON> Ficano </PERSON> said his narcotics unit seized $ 2 million in cash last year, double that of 1986. Authorities also estimate up to 50 percent of crack customers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> are suburbanites.

 Police say one of crack's most frightening aspects is heavy teen-age involvement. `` We've got kids going to school with $ 3,000 and -LRB- business -RRB- beepers in their pockets,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want to be brain surgeons. They want to be instantly gratified. ... You have immature adolescents with no goals. Give them a gun. Put them on crack. They have no compunction about killing someone.'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said their philosophy is: `` You live fast, you die young, you make a beautiful corpse.''' He said teens, including his daughter, are so jaded they read obituaries. `` She wants to know who in her age group has been shot,'' he said. `` It's a damn <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> body count. It's a whole different society out there.'' Teens also know if they get caught `` they're relatively immune, at least from long stretches of time'' because 85 percent are out of prison in 15 months, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schigur </PERSON> of the county prosecutor's office A 15-year-old can be waived to adult court, he said, but judges are often reluctant to allow that. Crack, however, spans all ages. In December, police arrested a 72-year-old woman and said they found crack in her sock. Trafficking often occurs in houses where violence and sex are commonplace. Police tell of finding rotting bodies in basements and 13-year-old girls offered as incentives for deals. Trading sex for crack has been tied to a phenomenal increase in penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhea. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had 2,797 cases last year, up from 187 in 1986, probably the fastest rate of increase in the nation, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Most were in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` There's a good deal of sex going on in crack houses, basically anonymous sex,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` People are saying, ` I do n't know who it was. This was a one-time situation.''' Although the crackdown may ease some of these troubles, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> still has problems. Residential drug treatment programs are crowded. And the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> was overcrowded 83 percent of the time in 1987, <PERSON> Ficano </PERSON> said, noting that triple-bunking or building a new jail are among options considered. While many support the crackdown, experts say it is n't a complete solution. `` This is going after the supply. ... We still have a population that wants drugs'' and will find a way to get them, said <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, senior project consultant at the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Experts also say churches, parents and schools must play a role in education, and attitudes must change. People must `` recognize the fact that when folks do n't have jobs, then they feel hopeless and they turn to hopeless things like drugs,'' said <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> Tinsley-Williams. Still, she said, the raids are a beginning. `` There's a sense of urgency in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` You've got to start somewhere.

 At the tender age of 18, when most teen-agers are thinking about college and careers, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> faces life in prison. The blond, baby-faced <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> was convicted last month of possessing eight kilos of cocaine, worth about $ 5 million. Police said that represented the largest single cocaine seizure in city history. <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> was sentenced Feb. 4 to the mandatory penalty of life in prison without parole. In a city where the fight against drugs is an uphill battle, this case represented a critical government victory, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON>, special agent-in-charge of the local office of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our total ability as a system to function was at stake,'' he said. `` If we could n't convict this guy, as out-front, as brash, as arrogant as he was ... what could we do? `` It was a very important sign to the community ... we can do the job as well as -LRB- deliver -RRB- the message _ if you deal in these quantities, you're going to go to jail for life.'' But, <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON> added: `` It's almost insulting to our profession that any 18-year-old could get to this kind of stature without us being able to snuff him out a long time ago. ... The fact this guy is so young is symbolic of what's going on in this city.'' Wershe, known on the street as `` White Boy Rick'' because most of his associates are black, still faces two other drug charges. His father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who has sued the police, alleging harassment, recently told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> he and his son worked for several years as federal drug informants. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> have declined comment. The younger <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> was `` at the top echelons of trafficking'' in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, supplying cocaine to a major crack dealer under investigation, <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON> said. `` Even though he looks like <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Face </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>,'' Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> said in a hearing last year, `` as far as this court is concerned he's worse than a mass murderer.'' Wershe's conviction stemmed from a May 1987 incident in which police found the cocaine in a box underneath a porch in the back of a house; they said he had dropped it there after fleeing officers. According to testimony, <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> was riding in a car stopped for a traffic violation in front of his grandmother's house. A fight broke out when police tried to grab a bag they later retrieved containing $ 29,000. Wershe ran from the car, but was later recaptured. More than an hour later, officers found the drugs in a box in a backyard a block from the grandmother's home. At the trial, a neighbor said <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> ditched the box in her yard and offered her $ 500. Defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> has nothing to do with the drugs and did n't know how they got there. He argued <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON> was the victim of police brutality _ defense witnesses said he was punched and hit with a pistol _ and the drug charges were concocted to conceal the beating. The government acknowledged police `` thumped'' Wershe, but said there was no excessive force. The defense also suggested authorities planted the drugs and pinned it on Wershe, but prosecutors argued it was ludicrous to believe police carry around 17.6 pounds of dope just in case. During the trial, Wershe was often surrounded by people wearing furs and gold and carrying telephone pagers sometimes associated with drug dealers. `` He was a local folk hero for the young people -LRB- who came to court -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> later said many of the `` kids hanging around the court'' were simply curious. <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON>'s father has been charged with threatening a police officer who testified against his son. Wershe Sr. has filed two multi-million dollar lawsuits against the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> police and others, alleging harassment, invasion of privacy and other charges. Though <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wershe </PERSON>'s sentence may deter some, it will not stop the flow of drugs in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. As he said, `` There's not going to be any lack for cocaine.''

 Here are some statistics on cocaine use and related problems in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area. The war on crack was announced Nov. 30. _ From Dec. 1 to Feb. 5, 914 adults were arrested on drug-related felony charges; 1,900 were charged with misdemeanors, according to police and court records. Officials say 240 juveniles were arrested on drug-related charges, both felonies and misdemeanors.

Of those, 511, or slightly more than 10 percent, were seized by the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> office, first among DEA branches, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON>, special agent-in-charge of the agency's local office. _ Two-thirds of men arrested in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for serious crimes tested positive for the recent use of illegal drugs, according to a study of 12 major cities released in January by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Positive results ranged from 79 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to 53 percent in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> _ A 1987 state report found increases in cocaine and crack use.

Cocaine as the primary drug fell from 12 percent to less than 1 percent in the same period.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December as exports hit new records, but the overall $ 171.2 billion shortfall for 1987 still measured the highest ever, the government reported. December's merchandise trade deficit was down from $ 13.2 billion in November and from $ 17.6 billion in October, and was the smallest figure since a $ 11.9 billion trade gap in January 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The improvement was driven by a 4.2 percent rise in exports, which reached record levels for the second month in a row.

The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that inventories held on shelves and backlots rose by $ 5.45 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 701.87 billion in December following even larger increases of 0.9 percent in November and 1.1 percent in October.

 The steepest climb in food prices in nearly 18 months, only partly offset by falling energy costs, pushed wholesale prices up at a brisk 0.4 percent in January, the government said. The increase, if it continued for 12 months, would amount to an annual wholesale inflation rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the 2.2 percent increase for all of 1987. A selection of goods priced at $ 10 in 1982 cost $ 10.62 last month, up from $ 10.57 in December and $ 10.40 in January 1987, the government said Friday.

 The massive Tax Reform Act of 1986 will probably cause agricultural investment to decline at least through the early 1990s, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Most of the investment decline can be laid to the law's repeal of the investment tax credit, which allowed up to 10 percent tax credit for qualifying capital improvements, the report said Friday. Most farm machinery, equipment, many farm structures and certain livestock operations qualified for the full 10 percent credit.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first major industrial strike in several years, the 8-day-old national walkout by more than 32,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> autoworkers, has not been primarily about money. Instead, it is an emotional dispute over the auto maker's push to impose more Japanese-style work practices on reluctant employees. Such practices, including computerization, more flexibility among workers and the cutting of auto-part inventories, have angered hourly workers enough for them to reject a sweetened offer from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> by more than a 60 percent margin, even though union negotiators had recommended it. Ironically, such practices also have made <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, British subsidiary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto maker and the largest auto maker in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, especially vulnerable to this strike The company's production in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was quickly affected when the walkout began Feb. 8 because the new efficiency at its European plants means they also now are more interdependent. The strike, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s first British strike in nearly a decade, has halted production at all <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 22 British plants. The action also has prompted the layoff of more than 9,700 workers and disrupted production at a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant in Genk, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, which suffered a shortage of British-made parts. It also has threatened production at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plants in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which also rely on parts made at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s British plants. In addition, it has cost <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> $ 40 million a day, at showroom prices, in lost British car production. Talks between the Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents two-thirds of the workers; representatives of the 11 unions that represent the rest, and company officials resumed today after an 11-day hiatus. `` Our primary goal has been to improve efficiency and productivity,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who was n't identified, in accordance with British custom. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> believes it needs to impose more efficient manufacturing methods to boost productivity and better fight off its competitors, such as <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in a market burdened with overcapacity. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> operates a highly productive plant in <LOCATION> Sunderland </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` We are not attempting slavishly to copy the Japanese. We are attempting solutions to our own problems,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> wants to introduce more flexibility so that, for example, a skilled worker could work on a production line. But some skilled workers apparently balk at working alongside unskilled workers. And some workers also appear to fear being overworked. Strikers have criticized Japanese-style work practices. But the Economist said: `` The strike has been led by men in <LOCATION> Dagenham </LOCATION> -LRB- assembly plant -RRB-, in booming east <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where workers feel they can demand big bribes in return for changing their work habits. Not so in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' Indeed, not all British workers have reacted this way to the increasing use of such manufacturing methods at Japanese and non-Japanese plants throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Many British workers in poorer areas of the country, such as the northeast, have felt downtrodden by the class system and are intimately familiar with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s widespread unemployment. These have eagerly embraced the Japanese practices of equality and job security. The new manufacturing techniques <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> imposed _ some worker flexibility, computerization and the slashing of inventories of auto parts to reduce costs _ increased the auto maker's productivity and profitability sharply Each <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employee produced 9.5 cars in 1986 vs. 6.4 each in 1984 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> produced more than 383,000 cars in 1987 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The British subsidiary's pre-tax profit tripled to about $ 569 million from $ 191 million in 1986, analysts estimate. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> wo n't report its results for a few months Union officials said opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s offer also centered on its three-year term, the first of its kind ever sought in the British auto industry. Previous contracts have been for one or two years. Some workers said they also object to linking their pay increases to government statistics for inflation because they claim the government underestimates the true rate of increase in consumer prices. The company's sweetened three-year contract offer included a pay rise of 7 percent in the first year followed by rises of 2.5 percent above the level of inflation in the scond and third years. The present pay of a middle-range worker is $ 327 a week. The last major industrial strike in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was a yearlong walkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-1985. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978.

 Stock prices drifted in a narrow range in moderate activity today, as interest rates rose in the credit markets.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 567 up, 786 down and 468 unchanged. The volume of shares traded totaled 74.44 million as of noon EST, down from 113.17 million as of noon EST in last Friday's session The stock market was closed Monday for the President's Day holiday. Analysts said stock trading today was subdued by a continued rise in interest rates in the bond market. Bond prices fell about $ 8 for each $ 1,000 in face value by midday, following similar declines Friday following several government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest rates. The government said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December, but interest rates rose on speculation the trade figures reflected economic strength which could prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> from easing credit.

<HEAD>Limited Earnings Fall 28 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday a 28 percent drop in earnings for its 1987 fourth quarter, in part because of poor performances by two divisions and slowed consumer demand for women's apparel. Earnings for all of 1987 were up slightly from the previous year, the retailer said. For the fourth quarter, Limited's earnings totaled $ 63.3 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with $ 87.5 million, or 46 cents a share, in the final three months of 1986.

 Like the easy-going, down-home characters they portray in their television commercials, sausage kings <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> do n't give the impression they are fighting whole hog for the fattest share of the market. It seems mostly a gentleman's competition for leadership in the breakfast sausage market between the two Dallas-based companies, whose officials praise each other's products as high quality. <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ranks first nationally, while the regionally distributed <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sausage </ORGANIZATION> leads in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, according to both companies' most recent <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> market share figures that exclude link and microwave sausage. Each claims to be the leader in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> region, although they decline to release those figures. `` We're tough competitors, but there's plenty of room,'' says former entertainer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who heads his company of the same name. `` They are formidable competitors. We continually go at it tooth and nail with each other,'' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, chairman of the venerable, 60-year-old Owens Country Sausage. Both <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> personally pitch their products on TV. The two Texans speak with an easy drawl about home and family and hearty breakfasts. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s celebrity status came almost 30 years ago when his `` Big Bad John'' country-western song hit the charts. He also hosted a television variety show. His answer on how he got into the sausage business is his standard one _ even in a telephone interview from his boat, the `` Big Bad <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' floating somewhere south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is wintering: `` Had you ever seen my act, you would realize diversification was imperative. I was in the hog business in <LOCATION> Plainview </LOCATION> and the market fell out and we were losing out. Quality sausage was something I did n't think existed,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a remark sure to leave the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> people aghast. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> founded the company with his brother, <PERSON> Don </PERSON>, in 1969. But the brothers waged a nine-year legal battle when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> made critical remarks about his brother's management of the company in the 1970s. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is no longer with the company. In 1986, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was ordered by a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> jury to pay <PERSON> Don </PERSON> $ 500,000 in damages for violating a 1980 agreement to keep quiet about his brother. A federal appeals court overturned that last year. Family relationships at <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> have been smoother. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> attained his reputation selling sausage as his father, C.B. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, did before him. But from his appearance and manner, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> could easily pass for a country-western star himself. `` Our emphasis is on our family's involvement -LRB- with the company -RRB- on a day-to-day basis and the family heritage and a history of reliability and consistency,'' he said, sporting a western-cut corduroy jacket, plaid shirt and thin gold chain around his neck. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, is now president of the company. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said it never really occurred to him to do anything but take over the family business, which started back in 1938 with the idea of using ham, loin and shoulder cuts in sausage _ instead of using it to `` get rid of the trimmings.'' `` Pork sausage was an abused product,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> explained. While both companies are headquartered here, both are now owned by bigger out-of-state corporations that allow them to continue to market their products under their own brand names. While <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is distributed nationally, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> is marketed from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and as far north as <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was acquired by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Sara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns other smaller sausage companies. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Bob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, in 1987. `` I think that's a big enough market that both are highly regarded in their respective areas. I do n't sense that either one is out to murder the other,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlang </PERSON>, senior vice president of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He called the <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans-Owens </PERSON> merger a `` very nice geographic expansion,'' though it's too early to tell if it will be successful. While their advertising harks back to home cookin' and simpler times, both sausage companies also are venturing into more modern-day markets _ with biscuits and microwave foods that are quick and easy to serve. `` Convenience is the deal today,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. `` Lifestyles are kind of changing with more working moms. Breakfast in many households has become getting a bite on the run.'' His latest TV commercials show <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> hawking a sausage biscuit that can be heated in the microwave oven. Likewise, the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> company is pushing English muffins topped with ham and cheese or sausage. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said the company will soon be test-marketing a small packaged hamburger, but declined to give more details. Mesquite-smoked sausage is being marketed in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area, while microwaveable sausage is being tested in several markets, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, vice president for marketing at <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> family also plans to get into the restaurant business, relying on the expertise of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' successful chain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to help get a new restaurant in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, off the ground in March.

 `` Hillbilly'' goes to work each day not knowing whether he'll face armed drug dealers, snarling pit bulls or scared children cowering behind closed doors. He lives in a world of danger and split-second decisions. Hillbilly, code name for a 37-year-old <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> narcotics officer, is `` shotgun man'' on a crew conducting daily drug raids. He's a foot soldier in the city's war against crack. Armed with a 12-gauge shotgun, Hillbilly is the first cop to enter dark crack houses and abandoned buildings. Followed by a crew of six to eight others, he secures the premises, looking for guns and people carrying them. The task takes about 30 tense seconds. The job takes a lot more: steel nerves, a quick mind and plenty of guts. `` You never get used to it,'' he said. `` You're always scared. You'd be a fool if you were n't. ... Your mind is more occupied with the entry. You always get a lump. ... Fear of the unknown.'' Judgment is critical. `` You have a decision to make,'' he said. `` You hope it's the right one.'' Hillbilly, given the nickname by co-workers because of his <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> roots, has been a cop for 17 years, 11 in narcotics. In that time, he's seen or heard it all: pit bulls guarding crack houses, people who've used children as shields and dealers who sat upstairs while a hooded, bound victim of an execution-style murder rotted in the basement. `` Their world is drugs,'' he said. `` Everything else is immaterial.'' Hillbilly said a contract was put out on his life years ago. He had 24-hour guards. He's also had a bullet whiz through his jacket sleeve and had partners shot. Once, suspects in a house started shooting through the door as the cops approached. The officer carrying a battering ram was hit. Hillbilly pushed him aside. He kept moving. Hillbilly and other narcotics officers wear bulletproof vests under blue jumpsuits and caps. The glow-in-the-dark word `` police'' is emblazoned on their heads, backs, chests, arms and shoulders. After hundreds of raids, Hillbilly says fighting drugs is `` definitely frustrating.'' `` You'll drive yourself crazy if you think the judges are not putting them away,'' he said. `` We try not to dwell on that. We just tend to lock that out.'' He cited one recent case in which a woman and her son were arrested and weapons and crack were seized. Weeks later, police raided the same place, he said, discovering more weapons and drugs. `` What's depressing and frightening to us is they pick up the guns so easily,'' he said. `` We'll probably end up -LRB- there -RRB- in another two or three weeks.'' Hillbilly also has no illusions about his impact on drug trafficking. `` We're not naive to think we're stopping any major drug distributors in the area,'' he said. But each complaint, he said, must be pursued, no matter how small. `` It's nice when you get a few of the bad characters off the street,'' he said. `` Whether we're helping society ... Well, they have to want to help themselves.'' Hillbilly said the worst part of the job is when cops are killed. `` It's heartbreaking.'' You wonder, he said, `` Is it all worth it? For eight rocks -LRB- of crack -RRB-, he's laying in the casket?'' But, he added, `` You shake it off. You go back.''

 Stock prices were narrowly higher in moderate activity today, as interest rates rose in the credit markets.

Analysts said stock trading today was subdued by a continued rise in interest rates in the bond market. Bond prices fell about $ 6 for each $ 1,000 in face value by midafternoon, following similar declines Friday following several government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest rates.

<HEAD>Crisis Looms Because Workers Lack Basic Skills</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 A telephone company attempting to recruit workers finds 84 percent of applicants fail the entry-level test. A congressional study shows most high-school juniors can not write a simple letter seeking a summer job. A steelworker misorders $ 1 million in parts because he can not read well. An insurance clerk who does n't understand decimals pays a claimant $ 2,200 instead of $ 22. Illiteracy caused by poor education has become an economic time bomb, threatening both the quality of the American work force and the nation's ability to compete on world markets, government policymakers say. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> estimates more than 27 million Americans older than 17 can not read or write well enough to perform basic requirements of everyday life. Another 45 million are considered barely competent in basic skills. That means more than 72 million _ one out of every three adults _ may lack the reading and writing skills they need to find work. And the number is growing annually by more than 2 million, federal officials say. These statistics coincide with a surge in demand for workers who not only can read and write, but who also can use computers, understand technological concepts and think independently in an economy that is shifting to services and information and away from manufacturing. Moreover, this erosion of worker literacy comes at a time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitors in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are forging ahead with educated work forces that may come to dominate the high-technology business of the 21st century. `` We need to determine what to do with the substantial fraction of our population that's ill-equipped to compete in a global economy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulecky </PERSON>. A study commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> titled `` Workforce 2000,'' published last June, estimated that between now and the end of the century, for the first time in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, a majority of all new jobs will require postsecondary education. This prospect presents a great risk to minority workers, who historically have lacked the schooling and skills needed to exploit job opportunities, said the study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private research organization. If that pattern persists, the study said, `` by the year 2000, the problems of minority unemployment, crime and dependency will be worse than they are today. Without substantial adjustments, blacks and Hispanics will have a smaller fraction of the jobs of the year 2000 than they have today, while their share of those seeking work will have risen.'' The problem is compounded by a declining number of people entering the labor pool, a consequence of the sharp dropoff in birth rates that followed the postwar baby boom. Some personnel executives say the literacy crisis already has hurt them. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> discovered last year that 84 percent of its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> applicants flunked the company's entry-level exam, which included basic questions on vocabulary and numerical relationships The <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Effective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION>, a corporate-sponsored group, has documented instances in which employees misordered millions of dollars in parts, overpaid bills and endangered work-place safety. In one case, a feedlot operator who misread a label killed a pen full of cattle by giving them poison instead of grain. Foreign companies building factories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also have been rudely awakened. At <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing operations, for example, personnel managers now test the educational level of all prospective employees. `` They're not just assuming that because someone comes in with a high-school diploma, he's going to be prepared,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurmo </PERSON>, program associate at the Business Council for Effective Literacy. Definitions of literacy vary greatly, but some tests have served as important guides. In 1985, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> asked 3,400 people aged 20 and older to answer at least 20 of 26 simple questions correctly. Nearly 13 percent failed. Other measurements are considered equally discouraging. A study mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 found that fewer than 400 of 2,000 11th graders could adequately write a note applying for a summer job at a swimming pool. College Board test scores have fallen about 8 percent over the past 20 years, while test performance abroad has risen. In an international calculus and algebra test done a few years ago, the best <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 12th graders came in last among students from the most developed countries. Japanese finished first. Estimates on the cost of work-place illiteracy also vary but are believed to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The Institute for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has said the cost is at least $ 225 billion per year, just in terms of lost productivity, welfare and related crime and prison expenses. In addition, at least $ 25 billion is spent by companies and private groups to upgrade worker education, but most of this effort reaches only a small fraction of those who need it most, says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who has done extensive research in the area. A great deal of illiteracy remains obscured, partly because many older employees are sensitive about their lack of skills, fearing they could be fired or face ridicule by seeking help. Some devise elaborate ways to conceal inability to read or write, including feigning nearsightnedess or taking job applications home to have spouses complete them, said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Zal </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group that organizes classes for adults. There are some encouraging signs. Millions of illiterate or barely literate adults are starting to take advantage of a growing range of educational programs offered not only by voluntary and government groups, but labor unions and employers themselves. The federally funded Adult Basic Education program, the largest single literacy effort in the nation, enrolled 3.1 million people in 1986, up from 2.5 million in 1984. Many large companies have started contributing money to community efforts, drafted tutors to help disadvantaged workers and organized schools of last resort to provide basic instruction. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, together spend at least $ 700 million annually on adult education. Other companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> offer remedial classes in plants and offices. Part of this corporate effort arises from a gradual realization among executives that it's in their long-term interest to have an adaptable and educated work force. But many in business still may not appreciate the magnitude of the crisis, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, publication director at <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, who wrote on the subject in a recent issue of Personnel Journal magazine. `` The major force driving corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to attack illiteracy is the same one that united the colonies 200 years ago: Either hang together on this issue, or hang separately,'' said <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>.

 Two nights a week, <PERSON> Demetrius </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> leaves his job at a toy-store warehouse for a midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> skyscraper, where volunteers help him read newspaper ads and write simple sentences in a frayed notebook. Three months ago, he could barely write his name. `` It takes a lot for a person to say, ` I need help,''' said <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, 26, who is enrolled in a class run by <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` A lot of people are scared to admit it.'' At 6:30 p.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western building's 40th-floor cafeteria becomes a school where <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> and about 70 other adults, many of them poor and unable to read beyond the second-grade level, receive tutoring in the literacy demands of everyday life, ranging from paying the rent to getting a driver's license. Some seek help to read dime-store novelettes. Others want to study the Bible or even opera librettos, Literacy Volunteer officials said. But for many, the training is vital to their ability to work and earn a paycheck. The students are taught by professionals including advertising executives, accountants and teachers, some from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s swank private schools. All are recruited by the Literacy Volunteers, which holds classes in 10 sites citywide. `` When adults do n't know how to read and write, they do n't have much faith in themselves,'' said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Zal </PERSON>, executive director of the Literacy Volunteers. He said the group gets a large part of its budget from corporate donors. Because of television publicity and a growing awareness of the nation's illiteracy problem, the Literacy Volunteers office has been inundated not only with applications from prospective students, but tutors as well. There is a 10-month waiting list for student spaces and for the first time, a waiting list for tutors, who receive a special training course before teaching a class. `` These people really want to learn. That's what is exciting to me,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Heininger </PERSON>, a 30-year-old volunteer tutor who works for <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>, a large public accounting firm. She began tutoring about three years ago and it has since become a regular part of her routine, she said. During that time, she has helped students learn to scan help-wanted ads and write notes to creditors about disputed bills. She recalled helping one student read a gambling handbook. `` I try to get my students to help each other,'' she said. `` One of the biggest things is to get their confidence up, and that strategy helps.'' <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, one of a half-dozen students taught by Ms. <PERSON> Heininger </PERSON> in her current class, said he decided to seek help partly because of his job at a Toys R Us warehouse, where he needed to recognize the names of games and other toys. `` When I first came to this class, I could n't read. Picking up a book was like a disease,'' he said. `` But now, no problem. When you come to realize you can do this, it's great.'' <PERSON> Nizam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a 28-year-old student in Ms. <PERSON> Heininger </PERSON>'s class, said he sought help after watching a TV ad about illiteracy 10 months ago. Unable to read, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> only had been able to get errand jobs or other work that did n't require filling out a job application, he said. Now he is reading simple romantic novels and wants a high-school diploma. `` Since I started here, it's done a lot for me,'' he said. `` I know how to do things. Write a check, read a sign. The teachers here, they help you a lot. They have a lot of patience.'' <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> estimated nearly 70 percent of Literacy Volunteer students are employed, and most want improved skills to help them at work. Although that is important, <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> said, he is concerned about what he called a preoccupation with work-place literacy that also could be harmful. `` It's one thing to learn how to read names on a paint-chip chart for your job,'' he said. `` But where does that person go to learn to read a bedtime story to his children? If work-place literacy is where it stops, it is rather frightening.''

<HEAD>Some Employers Devise Alternate Way to Cope with Illiteracy:
`Dumbing Down'</HEAD>

 Although many employers realize they must bolster workers' skills to stay competitive, others are restructuring so employees often do n't have to read, write or think _ a change some educators call `` dumbing down.'' Examples already abound, from the automatic teller machines at banks to the electronic scanners at grocery checkouts, to the pictures of hamburgers instead of digits on the cash-register buttons at fast-food outlets. Supporters of these computerized innovations say they raise efficiency and cut overhead and retraining costs. Critics agree such strategies can be helpful but often are based on the assumption that illiteracy in the work force is intractable. `` There are jobs that will be dumbed down. The problem is that someone has to service the computers that do the thinking,'' said <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Askov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Another problem, she said, is that dumbing down decreases job security and will likely raise turnover rates at jobs in which promotions are unlikely. `` Of course, people want to be able to advance in their jobs,'' she said. `` Fast-food cashiering is a dumb-down job. But employees ca n't advance, so they eventually drop out.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulecky </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and literacy expert, said some companies opt for the dumbing-down approach simply because of the retraining costs, which can become prohibitive among workers who lack a high-school education. `` To give you an idea of the magnitude, it takes about 100 hours to move somebody up one grade level. So from sixth grade to high school, you're talking about a substantial amount of time,'' he said. `` You're talking about hundreds and hundreds of hours of training. Nobody takes those decisions lightly,'' he said. `` It's a major investment, and companies have to take a look at who's worth investing in.'' Many companies dispute the argument that replacing people with computers is a long-range danger to a skilled work force. Large grocery chains, for example, have found automatic checkout systems that track inventory can alleviate time-consuming clerk jobs and free workers for more challenging tasks, such as managing delicatessen counters. At the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading chain with more than 1,100 stores, computerized checkouts have raised accuracy, decreased customer waiting time and largely eliminated the need for clerks to stamp individual prices on items, said company spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rourke </PERSON>. `` I'm not sure I would buy the premise that the technology is put in place to make decisions for the workers,'' he said. `` I'm saying the technology we're putting into effect is to improve efficiency, and improve speed in making decisions, and hopefully overcome some of the menial labor tasks. On a broader scale, such a strategy is part of the long-range plans of automaking giant <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which once predicted it would go from one technical job for every 5.6 manual jobs to a 1:1 ratio by 1995. The company already is ahead of schedule. One possible result of such a trend, educators say, is a polarization of the work force into a small number of highly trained professionals and a majority of employees largely unable to advance from relatively simple tasks. `` When your choice is, ` I ca n't hire somebody for under $ 12 an hour, and it's going to take me 500 hours of training,' then maybe you fire six of those people and have the one remaining directed by a computer,'' <PERSON> Mikulecky </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices were higher in moderate activity today, as interest rates rose in the credit markets. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down most of the morning, was up 10.11 points to 1,993.37 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 768 up, 716 down and 477 unchanged. The volume of shares traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 112.19 million as of 3 p.m. EST. The stock market was closed Monday for the President's Day holiday. Analysts said stock trading today was subdued by a continued rise in interest rates in the bond market. Bond prices fell $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value by midafternoon, following similar declines Friday following several government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest rates.

<HEAD>Ashton-Tate, Compaq Announcing Software On Wednesday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 10:30 p.m. EST; time set by sources.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have scheduled announcements for Wednesday that mark the personal computer industry's steady transition to a more powerful internal `` traffic cop.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is to unveil a vastly improved version o its D-Base software, the dominant program for managing information stored in personal computers. D-Base IV is capable of running under the new `` traffic cop,'' Operating System-2, the state-of-the-art software for directing traffic inside a personal computer. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is to announce Wednesday it is beginning deliveries of Operating System-2 for use in <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> personal computers. The announcements mark the growing acceptance of Operating System-2 since its announcement last April by <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The software allows computers to run several jobs at the same time and to handle bigger programs than can be handled by its predecessor, MS-DOS. OS-2 will supersede MS-DOS as the operating system of choice by the end of 1990, with 3.7 million copies shipped that year vs. 1.5 million copies of MS-DOS, <ORGANIZATION> Forrester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, predicted recently. <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>'s D-Base IV should help the <PERSON> Torrance </PERSON>, Calif.-based company against challengers such as <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Microrim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oracle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to analysts who got previews of the product. `` This product is a major advance over D-Base III Plus in almost every dimension,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said in an interview Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> had more than 60 percent of sales of data-base managers for personal computers last year, the company says. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is highlighting the ability of its computers to run Operating System-2 as part of a public-relations battle with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which says its new Personal System-2 computers are best suited to run OS-2. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is to have 21 independent software developers _ including <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> _ at an industry forum, commenting on their plans for programs that will take advantage of OS-2's features. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> intends to demonstrate that Operating System-2 runs faster on <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> computers than on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers, although <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was involved in OS-2's development, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing, said in an interview Tuesday. The new version of <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>'s D-Base features a redesigned look known as `` what you see is what you get'' and spares computer novices from having to do any programming to enter or retrieve information from the computer. For advanced users, a new programming language includes 245 new or improved commands and incorporates the industry-standard Structured Query Language created by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to running under the new Operating System-2, D-Base IV can also run under <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s older MS-DOS, which is still the one used on most personal computers. D-Base IV includes a compiler that allows it to run 10 times as fast as D-Base III Plus, <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> said. The compiler reduces the instructions in a program to a machine language that a computer can read rapidly. <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> said the new version contains about 400,000 lines of programming code vs. 106,000 in D-Base III Plus. The price is $ 795, up from $ 695 for D-Base III Plus. Current D-Base users can buy upgrades to D-Base IV for $ 175. <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> said the program was being announced early because the company will be showing it in a national tour led by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> that begins next week. Some of <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors have stumbled in efforts to beat the company to the market with data-base managers that work with Operating System-2. <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> and Oracle have failed to meet their own deadlines for data-base managers that run under Operating System-2. However, they may still beat <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> to market, because <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> said D-Base IV might not be available until the end of July.

<HEAD>Northwest, Union Spar Over Possible Flight Attendants Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' announcement that it will lay off 5,300 mechanics and baggage handlers if its flight attendants strike is a ploy to pit the two unions against each other, a union official says. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said Monday that the announcement made in a letter was only a precaution required by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> labor contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Northwest acquired Republic in 1986. But <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s letter was `` a ploy to play the unions against each other and lower morale. He said the letter would backfire and draw the unions closer together. The letter was sent last weekend to 2,900 mechanics and 2,400 baggage handlers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>. In it, <PERSON> Northwest </PERSON> said: `` Although your company does not expect a flight attendants strike, it is impossible to predict whether the flight attendants will actually go on strike. `` You may be placed on temporary no-work status due to a reduction in force'' if there is a strike. Northwest's 6,500 flight attendants, represented by the Teamsters, can strike at 11:01 p.m. Feb. 26. Bargaining between the airline and the union is expected to resume next week. The <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 20,000 ground workers at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, and the pilots union have not said whether they will honor a strike by flight attendants.

 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it planned to spin off its worldwide tire business into a $ 1.5 billion joint venture to be 75 percent owned by Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said the transaction, which must be approved by its shareholders, was expected to result in a $ 1 billion cash distribution to <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> shareholders as part of a major financial restructuring, according to a joint statement The company also said its board of directors adopted a `` poison pill'' takeover defense. Firestone stock soared $ 9.25 to $ 45 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading following the disclosures. The surprise announcements came amid speculation that Firestone would sell its <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, Ohio-based tire division to the Italian tire manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>. According to the trade publication <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> was the world's fifth-largest tire company in terms of sales, with 1986 tire sales of $ 2.3 billion. Firestone posted total profit of $ 103 million and revenue of $ 3.8 billion in the year ended Oct. 31, 1987. The tentative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> calls for Firestone to transfer tire assets and liabilities with an equity value of about $ 1.5 billion to the joint venture. The venture would be financed initially with $ 750 million in equity from <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, $ 250 million from Firestone and $ 500 million in debt, the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> would own about 75 percent of the company, and <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> 25 percent, the statement said. The two companies plan to operate the joint venture, which will be known as the <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as `` a relatively autonomous business unit, subject to the direction and control of a board of directors consisting of persons representing the owners,'' the statement said. Firestone spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said the company would retain its 1,500 car care centers; Firestone Diversified Products, which includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building products; <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synthetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said the tire division employs 30,000 people worldwide while the rest of Firestone's businesses employ 23,500 The joint venture would be based in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and would be assigned the exclusive right to use Firestone's name on tires throughout the world. The tentative agreement also calls for the joint venture to arrange contracts for raw materials with <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s remaining businesses and to supply tires to its car care centers. In a related move Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s board adopted a `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors. The plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20 percent or more of Firestone's common stock without board approval. The company said the plan was `` intended both to ensure that <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> and to protect the full value of its shareholders' investment in the company.'' Weekend news reports in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, quoted <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying their company had the financial strength to acquire Firestone and added that <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> representatives had visited <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s world headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> last week. `` I have no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> deal,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON>. `` That story was based on rumor, and I have no comment on rumors.'' The announcement on the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> deal came as <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s board met in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for a regularly scheduled session Firestone is the third-largest tire manufacturer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, behind <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In previous interviews, Firestone Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> had acknowledged the company might withdraw from the tire business. Firestone structured the tire business as a freestanding unit last November when its corporate staff moved from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The company will seek shareholder approval next month to change its name to <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It was not immediately known if shareholders would be asked to approve the joint venture at that meeting.

<HEAD>Northrop Net Soars; Absence of F-20 Costs Cited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its earnings rose 275 percent in the fourth quarter and 129 percent for the year, primarily because of money saved from the cancellation of its F-20 Tigershark program. The results also reflected a higher level of research and development on several classified projects for the Pentagon. For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company earned $ 34.9 million, or 74 cents per share, compared to a year earlier when it netted $ 9.3 million, or 20 cents per share. Revenue for the most recent period rose 6.6 percent to $ 1.77 billion from $ 1.66 billion. For the full year, the company's profits jumped to $ 94.2 million, or $ 2.01 per share, compared to $ 41.2 million, or 89 cents per share, while revenue rose 7.8 percent to $ 6.05 billion from $ 5.61 billion. The major factor in the increased earnings, the company said, was the absence of spending on the F-20, a fighter canceled in late 1986. Those costs totaled $ 236 million in 1986, including $ 105 million in the fourth quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> poured more than $ 1 billion in its own money into developing the F-20, which was designed primarily for foreign countries as a lower-cost alternative to the F-15 and F-16. But it was never able to find any buyers. However, 1987 results were depressed by a second-quarter $ 125 million writedown on a classified government project widely believed to be the Stealth bomber. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> earnings also were depressed by an unspecified amount as the company continued to pump its own funds into developing a prototype of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s 21st century warplane, the Advanced Tactical Fighter. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> are leading competing teams of defense contractors seeking a $ 40 billion production contract for the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>. Aerospace was <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s only business to show improvement. It had an operating profit of $ 59.2 million in the fourth period comared to a loss of $ 4.8 million a year earlier. For the full year, it earned $ 220.1 million, compared to $ 66 million in 1986. The company's electronics unit saw operating profits drop to $ 23.6 million from $ 36.8 million for the quarter and to $ 70 million from $ 99.7 million for the year, primarily because of lower revenue and profit margins on the MX missile program. The company's aerospace services segment posted a loss of $ 300,000 for the quarter, compared to a profit of $ 4.3 million a year earlier. For all of 1987, its profit was $ 10.3 million, less than half its 1986 level of $ 21.5 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported its earnings rose by 46.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 25.7 percent for the year, but much of the gain was accounted for by a tax adjustment. Without that adjustment, the company's earnings were up 17.6 percent for the quarter and 15.5 percent for the year, in line with what the insurer predicted earlier this month. The results, released Monday, come as Farmers is trying to fend off an unsolicited $ 4.13 billion takeover bid by the American subisidiary of London-based <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company netted $ 86.9 million, or $ 1.26 per share, compared to $ 55.5 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose by 13 percent to $ 302.3 million from $ 267.4 million. For the full year, the company's net jumped to $ 268.3 million, or $ 3.88 per share, in contrast to $ 213.5 million, or $ 3.09 per share, in 1986. Revenue rose 11.8 percent to $ 1.13 billion from $ 1.01 billion. Results for the most recent quarter and 1987 included a gain of $ 21.6 million, or 31 cents per share, from the tax adjustment.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against most major currencies in domestic trading Tuesday after turning in a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices were mostly lower. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 444.15 a troy ounce, down from Friday's late bid of $ 445.50. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and commodity markets were closed Monday in observance of Presidents Day. Traders said the dollar fell back after rising late last week on a government report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for December shrank for the second consecutive month. `` There was a lack of follow-through buying, particularly on behalf of the Japanese,'' in reaction to the improved trade picture, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He noted traders were `` looking to the dollar's downside'' after dealers overseas failed to show greater enthusiasm for the trade figures. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that while there was no major news to move the dollar, the currency also was depressed because of an `` unwinding of cross positions,'' in which dealings in other currencies affect the dollar. In European trading, the dollar was mostly firmer, although dealers could not pinpoint any definite trend. Foreign exchange dealers said markets were quiet, with some West German markets closed for a holiday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 130.50 Japanese yen, down from 131.00 yen late Monday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 130.30 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the dollar closed at 130.385 yen, down from 130.925 yen on Friday. The British pound fell to $ 1.7440 from $ 1.7455 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealings. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.74625 to buy one pound, more expensive than late Friday's $ 1.74175. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.71045 West German marks, down from 1.7115; 1.4040 Swiss francs, down from 1.4087; 5.7805 French francs, down from 5.7820; 1,258.00 Italian lire, down from 1,260.75, and 1.2685 Canadian dollars, up from 1.26445. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.7120 West German marks, up from 1.7085; 1.4038 Swiss francs, down from 1.4040; 5.7815 French francs, up from 5.7705; 1.9200 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9180; 1,260.00 Italian lire, up from 1,257.50; and 1.2687 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2658. Gold bullion prices varied, rising in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 445.50 a troy ounce, up from $ 445.10, but falling in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to $ 444.50 bid, down from $ 445.50. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> markets were closed for the Chinese New Year. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion traded at $ 445 a troy ounce, down from $ 445.30 a troy ounce on Friday.

The Dow indicator has risen 110.25 points in the last five trading sessions. `` For a market that's not supposed to go up, that's a pretty good performance,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, head of block trading for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Stock analysts were at a loss to explain the market's strong performance, especially in light of a recent rise in interest rates Usually higher rates hurt stock prices by threatening to slow down the economy and by providing an attractive investment alternative to stocks. Interest rates, after a big rise Friday, continued to climb Tuesday. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.46 percent as its price fell about $ 3 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Stocks got no help from the dollar, which weakened slightly against most major currencies. And metals prices _ an early warning sign of commodity inflation _ rose strongly. `` It's kind of befuddling,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> did not appear to move the market. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> speech that the economy seems to be in equilibrium and gave no indication that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was ready to change its monetary policy. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 135.38 million shares, against 144.86 million in last Friday's session. The stock market was closed Monday for Presidents Day. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by 880 to 620 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 487 stocks unchanged. Firestone shot up 9 \ to 45 The company said it planned to spin off its worldwide tire business into a $ 1.5 billion joint venture to be 75 percent owned by Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has corrected many of the safety problems that led to a $ 9.5 million fine two year ago, but a small airline <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is enlisting to combat a possible strike faces safety penalties of its own, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> disclosed Tuesday. The separate <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> findings surfaced as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s safety record came under renewed scrutiny at a congressional hearing where <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots at times laughed derisively at some of the assurances on safety made by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> executives. Eastern has been in the midst of labor problems for months, with charges by the unions that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management is cutting corners on safety. The 10,000-member machinists union has been locked in talks under a federal mediator and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,000 pilots have not said whether they would work if the machinists went on strike. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, ake by mechanics, Eastern might be forced out of business. Eastern has lost $ 900 million since 1978, including $ 181.7 million last year. Two years ago Eastern was fined a record $ 9.5 million by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for a broad range of maintenance and record-keeping violations. In a followup report on the airline since the fine, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that while many of the maintenance problems appear to have been resolved, some concerns persist. A three-month review of Eastern that ended last November `` shows substantial progress has been made,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for aviation standards, said in a statement accompanying the report `` However there are areas that need attention, including maintenance procecures that identify repeated failures of the same item,'' he said. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> also said that Eastern still must reduce the number of postponed maintenance items carried over from day to day on aircraft. And the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report noted that while <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management has improved manuals, operating specifiations and maintenance inspection procedures, agency inspectors could not say for certain `` if -LRB- Eastern -RRB- is now complying with its -LRB- own -RRB- program and procedures.'' Eastern, in a statement from its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report shows <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has take action to deal with 52 of the 53 areas of concern cited two years. The airline said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s latest review reflects attempts by the carrier to correct past problems `` Over the past two years, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has concentrated on upgrading the quality of its flight and maintenance performance,'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. But a separate <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report prompted questions among some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s recently announced plans in event of a strike at the Miami-based airline. Eastern recently said it was leasing 26 of its jetliners to <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a cargo carrier based in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and that in event of a strike <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> would fly some of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s routes using its own personnel. But a report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday cast doubts on <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s safety record The agency disclosed that it is preparing to take enforcement action, including a civil penalty, against <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> for past safety infractions. Government scrutiny of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> documented `` a large number of serious safety infractions'' including `` systematic difficulties'' with the use of operating and maintenance handbooks and training programs, said <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official. The infractions found at <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> `` are being corrected to prevent similar occurrences in the future'' and the corrections `` permit <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> to safely operate its cargo business,'' said <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> in a statment, although not specifically addressing the question of whether <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> would be permitted to operate scheduled passenger service. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> must approve such authority. During the hearings on <PERSON> Captitol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was accused of using <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> to break a possible strike. On the basis of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report, Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the subcommittee, characterized <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> as `` an airline in near shambles,'' including problems with pilots' and mechanics' training, maintenance records and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> vice president, told the subcommittee that virtually all of the problems cited by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> have been corrected.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached In Ford Strike</HEAD>

 Negotiators reached agreement Tuesday to end a nine-day strike that has halted production at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 22 plants in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and cost the automaker more than $ 300 million, company and union officials said. The deal will be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 32,000 striking workers on Thursday, and if approved, could allow the automaker to resume production next Monday, officials said. The settlement came after <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a two-year pact with total minimum pay hikes of 14 percent, negotiators said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> previously insisted on a three-year contract, which auto workers opposed. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it will guarantee full pay to union members who are temporarily laid off. The company said it would not permanently terminate any worker who does not volunteer to leave. The agreement also stipulates that work-rule changes would be decided at the plant level instead of being imposed by management, said <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, chief negotiator for the 12 unions involved. The contract also provides for increased pension benefits and an improved health plan. `` We see it as a truly historic victory, not only for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers but for trade unionists up and down the country,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said after nine and a half hours of talks. The deal was called a `` potential victory for common sense'' by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hougham </PERSON>, chief negotiator for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the British subsidiary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker He denied that the automaker was pressured into the agreement by its Detroit-based parent or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The walkout, which was <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s first strike in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in nearly a decade, began Feb. 8, three days after contract talks broke down. Under terms of the agreement reached Tuesday, weekly wages for an assembly worker making a basic 184 pounds, or $ 320, will increase to 197 pounds, or $ 343 in the first year of the new contract, negotiators said. Talks to provide the same benefits for hourly and white-collar workers will be completed within two years, the company said. `` I do believe the company will get the changes -LRB- in work practices -RRB- it wants,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` But they will get them under the circumstances when they will carry the workforce with them.'' `` There will be cooperation to bring about the changes we need,'' <PERSON> Hougham </PERSON> said. The strike prompted the layoff of more than 9,700 workers and disrupted production at a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant in Genk, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, which suffered a shortage of British-made parts. The strike has cost <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> 23 million pounds, or about $ 40 million a day, the automaker has estimated. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978.

 Sales of existing homes held steady in 1987 at close to 4 million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the October stock market collapse, a national real estate trade group reported Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said that sales of existing single-family homes and condominiums totaled 3.885 million units last year, down a slight 0.3 percent from the 1986 level of 3.897 million units. Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this decade. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lousisiana </LOCATION>, two states which had suffered a big slump in sales because of depressed energy industries, enjoyed a rebound last year, leading the country along with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with the largest percentage gains. Meanwhile, the average price of an existing home rose to a nationwide median of $ 84,300 at the close of last year, an increase of 5.1 percent in 1987, slightly ahead of the rise in consumer prices, the association said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> maintained their rankings as the most expensive places to buy homes while <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, had the biggest percentage price gains out of 53 metropolitan areas surveyed. The median price of an existing home averaged $ 180,800 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and $ 178,600 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> during the final three months of the year. At the other end of the scale, the most affordable housing was in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where the median sales price was $ 52,000. The Northeast, which has been a hot real estate market for several years, had the four top cities in terms of percentage price increases. Home prices were up 32.2 percent in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, 21.7 percent in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, 20 percent in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and 18.2 percent in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Fourteen cities in the survey, concentrated in depressed energy and farm areas of the country, saw home prices decline during 1987. The biggest price drop was 7.2 percent in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> followed by a 5.6 percent decline in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In all, 22 states enjoyed sales increases in 1987, led by a 26.2 percent surge in sales in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and identical increases of 18.8 percent in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> were both rebounding from big sales declines in 1986 while the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> increase followed a sizable 1986 advance. Also enjoying big gains were <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, with an 18.5 percent increase and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, with advances of 17.9 percent and 14.3 percent respectively. `` The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> continues as the strongest region but we saw considerable strength in the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, two areas which had been lagging the rest of the country,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the realtors group. Twenty-two states suffered sales declines last year, led by a 13.8 percent drop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Sales fell off 13.3 percent in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, followed by declines of 9.7 percent in both <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Sales were off 9.5 percent in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a last-minute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits before the new tax law took effect on Jan. 1, 1987. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted that price increases nationwide should be lower than the 5.1 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to decline by around 8 percent, in part because of slower economic growth. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted that the Northeast will continue to have the highest home prices of any region, but he said the rate of increase should slow. `` A leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated activity,'' he said. `` The losses incurred by those in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial community are still having a lagging effect on home buying in that area.''

 Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices fell sharply Tuesday as warmer weather moved into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s orange-grove country and melted fears of a freeze. On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals were lower; energy futures retreated; and stock-index futures advanced. Forecasts late last week for cold weather in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had some orange juice traders on the New York Cotton Exchange worried but the orange crop escaped freeze damage, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said last weekend may have held the season's last threat of a freeze `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> escaped what may have been one of its last cold spells from a seasonal perspective,'' <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> said. `` People may have seen that and sold it off.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> also noted a widening of the gap between prices for near-term and deferred delivery. The March contract settled 2.40 cents lower at $ 1.661 a pound, more than 5 cents higher than the settlement price for May delivery. The pattern indicated concerns about tight supplies for immediate delivery, she said. Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in position-evening in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly seven-state cattle-on-feed report. The report, issued after the close, showed an 8 percent increase during January in the number of a cattle being fattened for slaughter. The total of more than 7.85 million head on feed was greater than most analysts had expected, which could drive cattle futures lower on Wednesday, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. However, the report also showed 1.66 million head placed on feedlots during January and 1.76 million head removed from feedlots to be slaughtered. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said those numbers indicated supplies and demand for fed cattle were running close to even, which should limit any downward move in prices. `` I think the near-term bias for the markets should n't be too affected,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. `` The feedlots are current and the near-term supply side of this market is doing just fine.'' Live cattle settled .22 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 71.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .33 cent higher with March at 83.37 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .40 cent higher with February at 47.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .42 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 55.70 cents a pound. Corn and soybean futures closed lower while wheat finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybean prices were pressured by a variety of factors, including speculative profit-taking, increased farmer selling on cash markets and improved soybean growing conditions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Corn futures also retreated on profit-taking and farmer selling, analysts said. Most wheat contracts advanced on rumors the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was set to buy at least 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced it had sold 16.1 million bushels of surplus wheat Friday at its weekly auction The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had said it expected to sell 25 million bushels, and it set a target of 25 million bushels for this Friday's auction. Wheat settled 1 \ cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 3.31 a bushel; corn was 1 \ cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 1.98 \ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 12 cents higher with March at $ 1.91 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 6.20 -LCB- Gold and silver futures retreated slightly in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the gold market was poised at a crossroads formed by opposing ideas about the future of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Gold settled 40 cents to $ 1.10 lower with April at $ 447.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 1.5 cents lower with March at $ 6.375 a troy ounce. Oil futures dipped slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in light, technically-based trading, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 25 cents lower with March at $ 16.67 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .32 cent lower with March at 46.37 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .14 cent lower to .01 cent higher with March at 46.29 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures moved higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 3.30 points higher at 262.20.

 <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in a deal valued at around $ 750 million. The transaction represents the largest investment ever by a Japanese bank in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> financial institution, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` They're getting close to being a major <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bank,'' he said. The deal will more than double the size of Cal First to a total of $ 15.2 billion in assets with 167 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> offices, making it the state's fifth largest commercial bank. Los Angeles-based Union currently is fifth, trailing <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> and First Interstate. <PERSON> Seishichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Cal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION>, said the bank had signed a letter of intent to acquire Union from London-based <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chartered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> owns 77 percent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> First, known until several years ago as <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> said the merger makes `` a good match'' because <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is a major business bank and Cal First mainly serves individual consumers. However, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was critical of the deal and placed its credit ratings of all Cal First, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on its `` CreditWatch'' list. S & amp; P noted <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s narrowing margins and high overhead expenses and said `` these concerns are exacerbated by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>'s relatively large exposure to sovereign borrowers with payment difficulties.'' The merger is part of a growing interest among the Japanese in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial firms. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> invested $ 500 million in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to reduce daily price limits for Major Market Index futures to 20 points and <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> futures to 12 points. The changes will become effective only if approved by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A 20-point move in the Major Market Index or a 12-point move in the Institutional Index represents roughly 5 percent of the indexes' present levels. In recommending the move, <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the new limits would be more consistent with those in effect on stock index futures traded at other exchanges. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> set permanent daily price limits on its stock index futures in an attempt to curb trading volatility that some critics say worsened the October stock market crash.

 A Toronto-based real estate company launched a $ 245 million offer Tuesday for up to 14 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, adding another chapter to the complicated fight for control of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. The offer by <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which works out to $ 17.50 a share, would boost <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON>'s stake in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to 19.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York, which had control of 10.5 percent of the railroad and natural resources company, is challenging a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to wage a proxy fight for control of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. `` I think Olympia & amp; York are trying to make sure they have a controlling position in the company,'' said <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Benham </PERSON>, an analyst at <LOCATION> Printon </LOCATION>, Kane In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> is </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder with 15.7 percent. It plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 4.7 billion restructuring plan, which was seen as an effort to stop <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s advances Olympia & amp; York supported the restructuring, and its representatives have been nominated to two seats on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe board. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, which has about 156.2 million shares outstanding, said it has been informed of <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON>'s tender offer but had no comment, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said company Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON> was `` pleased with the move,'' but he would not elaborate. Under the restructuring plan, <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive $ 25 in cash and $ 5 in subordinated debentures per share. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has said the debentures are another effort by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to prevent a takeover, and is challenging them in court. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has set Feb. 26 as the date for a preliminary hearing on the issue. A debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not the company issuing it makes a profit. The <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York offer, which expires at midnight March 13, hinges on payment by <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fe </PERSON> of a special dividend, the cash part of which the company said it paid Tuesday, with the debenture payment set for March 1. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, citing the effects of the restructuring plan, said it downgraded the securities ratings of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries, the <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said the downgrade was based on the `` substantial weakening in the parent's debt-protection measurements because of a recent corporate restructuring. About $ 1.4 billion of securities are affected. `` The dividend, which will result in an outlay of approximately $ 3.9 billion, will be funded primarily through proceeds from asset sales, the senior subordinated debentures and bank debt,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moodys </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This outlay will substantially reduce the firms' equity, and the additional $ 4.6 billion of debt will radically increase leverage.'' The New York-based rating agency said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>'s ability to generate cash flow to meet maturing obligations depends primarily on an aggressive real estate divestiture program.
