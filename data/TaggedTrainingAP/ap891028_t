 The trial of former <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> skipper <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> will be held in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> despite defense claims that it will be hard to field an impartial jury in this port city. `` If <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> can get a fair trial, I'm sure Capt. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> can get a fair trial, too,'' <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> said at a hearing Friday. Prosecutors had earlier agreed that <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, where the tanker picked up its load before causing the nation's worst oil spill March 24, was an inappropriate site for the trial. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madson </PERSON>, of Fairbanks, argued that an opinion poll showed that inland Fairbanks was the city most likely to offer a fair trial. He said people in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, which lies on the coast about 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, were more likely to be influenced by ties to maritime industries affected by the spill. <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> pushed for his city, saying it offered a much bigger pool of potential jurors. The city's population of 250,000 is about five times the size of Fairbanks <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces misdemeanor and felony charges stemming from the crash of the tanker in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Exxon fired the skipper soon after the ship struck a charted reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, polluting miles of shoreline and killing wildlife. The trial on charges of recklessness, negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated is scheduled to open Jan. 22 and is likely to last at least three weeks. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, listened to Friday's hearing by telephone from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law office

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will be going places this Halloween, even though he's in prison. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> costumes are among the most popular get-ups for tricksters this Halloween, says the owner of a costume shop. `` We put <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in a convict suit and everybody likes that,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Balloon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, which is 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s rented out for the rest of the week.'' Elsewhere, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> proved to be more than just a hit at the box office, overwhelming some costumers who could n't keep up with the demand for Caped Crusader Halloween outfits. `` Batman _ he's the top dog,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, assistant to the general manager at Masters Tuxedo in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Wickham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costume </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> community of Wheeling is n't renting Batman outfits and was even unable to find any to sell, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Materkoski </PERSON>, a receptionist pressed into duty as a saleswoman during the seasonal crunch. `` We had a couple of people who were willing to buy, but when we called the supplier who would have sent them to us, they were out, and that was in September,'' she said Friday. Masters Tuxedo found a licensed supplier in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but not even <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s most famous do-gooder could defeat the weather. `` Batman was delayed by Hurricane Hugo,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said Friday. `` They were manufactured, and the hurricane knocked down their computers, so they could n't bill or ship.'' He still hoped for a pre-Halloween shipment. Being the Caped Crusader costs an arm and a bat-leg. A Batman costume rental goes for $ 85, and buying the cape and accessories will -LRB- POW! -RRB- set you back -LRB- BAM! -RRB- $ 450, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Shipments of Weapons Materials Again Suspended in Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is suspending commercial shipments of tritium for the second time in four months because of another unexplained loss of the material used in nuclear warheads. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., lambasted the department Friday, saying it had bungled the investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` You have to wonder what kind of <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION> operation the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has down at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> when they lose more than 22,000 curies of tritium in a test designed to find out why <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> keeps on losing track of tritium,'' he said A curie is the unit used to measure radioactivity. The department usually sells about $ 5.6 million of tritium a year to private companies that use it in research and the manufacture of luminous lights and dials. Most tritium, however, is used as a vital component in nuclear warheads. `` For now, we're on hold on making further shipments,'' said <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, deputy director of the lab, said in a telephone interview that investigators had not ruled out the possibility the material was stolen. He said, however, that there was no evidence of theft and that a more likely explanation was that the equipment that handles the gas had developed an air leak. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said shipments were suspended Oct. 5, shortly after it was discovered that a small amount of tritium shipped to a commercial customer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was missing. No date has been set for resuming shipments, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. Spokesmen at department headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said they had no firm information about the situation at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>. They said questions about missing tritium and the Oak Ridge operation were being reviewed by Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. Senior officials directly involved in the issue declined to accept a reporter's phone calls. The department announced a halt in shipments from <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> in July after an inconclusive search for about 5 grams of tritium that lab records said had been shipped to commercial customers but that buyers said never arrived. Shipments resumed in August, although not all of the lost material had been recovered. An internal lab report on efforts last summer to account for the missing material said theft was possible but unlikely. A copy of the confidential report and related Oak Ridge documents were obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week under a Freedom of Information Act request. Investigators for <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs Oak Ridge under an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract, said in the July report that a significant amount of tritium was lost during a test shipment between lab buildings. Based on figures in the report, it appeared the loss amounted to about 2 grams. That's about half the amount needed to make a single atomic warhead, according to private analysts. The test shipment was arranged as part of a broader effort to find reasons for the shipping discrepancies. Workers loaded tritium into a container, sent it across the lab to another building, unloaded part of it for sampling, reloaded it, sent it back to the original building and unloaded it again. For reasons not yet publicly explained, three-quarters of the tritium was lost in the round trip. Leakage from the containers and other procedural problems were ruled out.

 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating allegations of wrongdoing at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says its inquiry is likely to end soon, but that the subcommittee has shown there was a `` colossal scandal'' at the agency. `` I have high hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will do its duty,'' subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Friday after former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> again refused to testify <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> excused <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> from a subpoena requiring another appearance next week and said the panel, faced with a refusal to testify from three other former top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, would soon end its inquiry. The subcommittee, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said, had `` demonstrated a colossal scandal'' existed at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reaga </PERSON> administration. The panel is investigating allegations of fraud, influence-peddling and mismanagement. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said the subcommittee does n't plan to offer immunity from prosecution to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> or his former aides as a way of compelling them to testify, though that remains an option. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination for a second time Friday, and some lawmakers called for a special prosecutor. `` Now it's clear that <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is stonewalling,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Our only choice now is to take the process from the legislative arena and move it into the arena of an independent counsel.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he wants to tell his story but refused to answer any questions, saying he had been made a target of the subcommittee's investigation and `` unfairly accused of alleged lies and dishonesty. `` I look forward to the time when innuendoes and rumors to the contrary are put to rest,'' he said. `` I look forward to the time when I can tell my story, and I can assure you I do have a story to tell.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> testified voluntarily before the panel in May. But he refused to testify last month when the panel subpoenaed him to answer questions about what members say are inconsistencies and contradictions between his and other witnesses' testimony. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> put a series of questions to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, including one about a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official's contradiction of the former secretary's testimony that he did not influence the selection of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidy awards <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> called the question `` unfair'' and refused to answer. Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s earlier testimony on that point `` could be perjury'' and told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> it was `` in your best interest'' to answer After <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s latest refusal, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., both members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said they would seek a vote to formally ask the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to name a special prosecutor to investigate <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> Only a majority of the members of either party on the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is required to initiate a formal process requiring a review of the request and response by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` I think it's clear from these hearings ... that there is criminal activity at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in the area of defrauding of the federal government, conspiracy to defraud the government, and we may well have perjury,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, meanwhile, disclosed that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had asked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to pay his legal expenses stemming from the congressional probe <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> rejected the request, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said.

 Americans doing business with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could face up to a 12-year prison sentence under a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration declaration naming him an agent of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Felicidad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieiro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and 32 companies, including several hotels and airport duty-free shops, are being added to the list of 134 businesses and individuals already identified as Cuban agents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. `` This action is another step in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' efforts to halt the channeling of funds to the illegal regime of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and to neutralize Cuban commercial activities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that serve to circumvent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo against <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' the announcement said. Fourteen names, including <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, were added to the list Sept. 20. Under a World War I statute, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has banned trade by Americans with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since 1960. Violations of that embargo or similar bans against trade with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> can result in fines up to $ 500,000 against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations and up to $ 250,000 against individuals, who can also be imprisoned for a maximum of 12 years. The latest action `` serves to underscore the administration's resolve to undermine the extensive network of commercial and financial collusion between the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> regimes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity last week, had revealed that the designation was imminent. The officials said they had begun examining ways to bring new pressure to bear on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> even before an abortive coup attempt Oct. 3. But the administration has been reluctant to use extreme measures such as a trade embargo out of concern that hundreds of American companies in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would go bankrupt. The new sanction is narrowly targeted at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his business partners and is not expected to do major damage to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. It is not clear how extensive American business dealings are with the companies linked to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has found these companies useful to import high technology U.S.-made items which otherwise would be beyond <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s reach because of the trade embargo. The companies also have served as conduits for illegal Cuban exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Watkins Shakes Up Leadership of Nuclear Weapons Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Turmoil appears to be growing at top levels of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spurred in part by Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' frustration at ineffective leadership in the office overseeing production of nuclear weapons. In an internal memorandum obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told the department's No. 3 official, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, to assume temporarily the added title of head of defense programs, which runs the nuclear weapons system. The defense programs office has been without a permanent director for more than a year. `` The vital national security mission of the department can no longer be carried out under the current management arrangement,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> wrote, adding that Tuck's assignment was designed to give the office `` leadership and direction.'' The central problem for <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is that his choice to be permanent head of the weapons office, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, has been unable to gain <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. Stello was nominated by the White House in July, but a confirmation hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has not been scheduled. Stello has been sharply criticized by environmentalists and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for being lax on nuclear safety, although he calls the charge unfair. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he hoped the Stello nomination would be acted upon soon, but one environmental group opposed to <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said it appeared <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was anticipating the possibility that Stello either would be blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or dropped by the White House. `` He's doomed,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> Also Friday, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> announced the resignation of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as director of the office of energy research. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> had drawn criticism in some scientific circles for his efforts to restructure the department's fusion research program. No replacement was announced. In a related development, advisers told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> on Friday that the department may be moving too quickly in its plans for restarting the three idled <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear reactors that produce a gas needed in nuclear warheads. In a letter to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Facility Safety said that while prospects for a safe resumption of production at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> had improved in recent months, a number of serious problems remained. The chief concern was that training of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers who operate the reactors has not included `` reactor fundamentals'' learned by operators of commercial nuclear reactors. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> runs <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> under a government contract. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors, built for the government in the early 1950s, were closed down more 18 months ago because of mechanical problems and safety concerns. Among the major issues in planning a restart is whether the operators are adequately trained and whether <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> puts enough emphasis on safety. The advisers told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> that while restart planning was generally good, the absence of operator training in reactor fundamentals was a serious problem. `` That this omission will remain through restart may belie <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that safety is their primary concern and that early restart of the reactors is not the driving factor in training,'' the letter said. In addition, the committee members said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> may be biting off more than he can chew in trying to get all three idled reactors back in operation within a six-month period starting next summer or fall. It might be wiser, they said, to focus all the best available talent on restarting one reactor before focusing on another.

 Exxon is resigning from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate advisory panel because it says the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the Exxon Valdez oil spill along the Alaskan coast. The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation, but issued a stinging response that called <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> a `` corporate pariah'' that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists. The federation, with 5.8 million members nationwide, has been one of the sharpest critics of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly ignoring requests to meet and discuss it. The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> was one of the charter members of the <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> to foster `` frank and open discussions'' between industry and the federation's leaders.

The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in August against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> seeking full payment of environmental recovery costs from the spill.

 Fans stood for a moment of silence, then let out a whooping cheer Friday as the World Series resumed 10 days after a devastating earthquake. Rescue workers threw out the first ball and the crowd joined in singing the 1936 song `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'' in opening ceremonies that began with a moment of silence for those killed and injured in the quake. `` We've had enough time for mourning. Now it's time to celebrate life,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvers </PERSON>, 62, who wore a yellow hard hat. `` This series needs to be played. If they canceled it it would have been a lot harder to do other things.'' `` It was OK to be excited,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Verhorst </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> defeated the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> 13-7, giving the <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> a 3-0 advantage in the best of seven series. The first cheer went up when the scoreboard lit up with, `` Welcome Back to Game 3'' _ and the stadium shook again, not from the quake but the roar of the fans. Some less fortunate fans watched the game from <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters where televisions were set up for the thousands of people left homeless. `` It takes your mind off the earthquake, and that's good for the nerves,'' said <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, 54, as he sat with a cluster of A's fans in the gymnasium of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> For many, the resumption of the Bay Bridge World Series, its symbol now fractured by the quake, was a kind of therapy in the wake of the deadly tremor. `` Time heals all wounds,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, another fan. He and a friend, <PERSON> Alphonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>, had seats two rows from the top of the stadium, and <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> had made a banner that read, `` Upper deck parachute rental.'' As fans filed in, the public address system periodically said, `` In the event of an aftershock, do n't panic ...'' `` I think it's my attempt to conquer my own fears,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Walch </PERSON> of his decision to attend the game. Having seen Candlestick shudder and crack, he added, `` I want to be at the World Series, and I do n't think it's more unsafe ... than any other place. And I want to get back to my normal life.'' The organizers of the game tried to help. Throwing out the first balls were 12 representatives of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area agencies who assisted in relief efforts. They included workers from the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol. `` We've realized we need all this. Baseball can be part of this area's mental therapy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. `` Baseball is the most resilient of all American institutions,'' said Commissioner <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who announced a $ 1.4 million gift from baseball to earthquake relief. Mail <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> received from around the country after the quake urged that the series be called off, he said Friday, adding that he understood the feelings. `` But I do n't think there is any disrespect in going on with the World Series,'' he said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, starting pitcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>, said the players have had difficulty preparing for the game. `` We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> outfielder <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the game gave 62,000 fans `` a chance to let out all that frustration and hurt and trauma. This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s game. It's going to bring all of us in this area back together again.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> agreed. `` We all need a respite,'' he said. `` We can enjoy the World Series and still remember those we lost and those who are still affected by this tragedy.'' Six people remained unaccounted for, authorities said, and the death toll rose Friday to 64, including an 88-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead. Thirty-nine of those killed were in the collapse of double-decked Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. As demolition there continued, the search for more bodies was delayed because the road was too shaky. In other quake developments: _ <ORGANIZATION> Dockworker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helm </ORGANIZATION>, rescued after four days in the rubble of I-880, remained in serious condition in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>'s Highland General Hospital. He was said to be conscious most of the time. _ <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, the 6-year-old whose leg was amputated during rescue from the I-880 rubble, was listed in good condition and improving at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. His sister <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, 8, was in serious but stable condition following surgery Wednesday. They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About $ 48,000 has been donated to a fund for them. _ On Friday, 150 relatives and friends gathered at an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cerrito </LOCATION> cemetery for the funeral of a woman killed on the collapsing portion of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anamafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Filoli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moala </PERSON> was buried in a ceremony typical of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, with dirges and many of those present wearing palm grass skirts. _ In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> on Friday, a wrecker's ball crashed into the imposing <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a downtown landmark and centerpiece of the heavily damaged <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>. Some who watched the demolition, which began Thursday, dabbed at tears. For 94 years the huge brick building was a gathering point for the seaside tourist town. `` We will come back, better than it was,'' said 86-year-old <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>. _ Lawyer <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> on Friday filed $ 22 million worth of claims against the state on behalf of 10 victims of the collapse of I-880. If the claims _ $ 3 million for each of two wrongful deaths and $ 2 million for each of eight injured survivors _ are rejected by the state, civil lawsuits would be filed, <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> said. _ A convention of traumatic stress experts that coincidentally came to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> a few days after the earthquake held a seminar on the disaster Friday, with experts saying everyone in the area needed to talk about the experience and to use jokes to relieve stress. `` The use of humor is good,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traumatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's so much irony.'' People in the area have swung through a gamut of emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at being alive, he said.

<HEAD>Balancing of First Amendment, Privacy Rights Debated</HEAD>

 Journalists should do a better job of balancing privacy and First Amendment rights, says a woman who accused the media of badgering her family after her daughter was murdered. However, reporters and editors who participated in the same free speech seminar said most journalists are sensitive about how their story might affect the private lives of people they write about. Reporters and editors in the past tended to `` go with it and worry about the consequences tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McCord </PERSON>, senior editor at the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't seem to be like that anymore.'' About 60 journalists, media lawyers and others attended Friday's seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization for 16 national media and communications groups The organization tries to educate the public about First Amendment issues. <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, who founded a victims' support group after her 14-year-old daughter was murdered in 1985, criticized the media for publishing her address and camping outside her home with television crews. She said she was badgered by a reporter who wanted to film her daughter's bedroom and the media questioned whether she and her husband had violated child labor laws by letting her daughter work in the donut shop where she was abducted. `` One of the big gripes I have with the press is that they apply the same standards to -LRB- crime -RRB- victims as to public officials who are derelict in their duties,'' Mrs. Day said. The journalists said there were no clear guidelines for deciding when privacy concerns outweighed the need to have a fact in the story. `` For years and years, that collision of privacy needs and the need to know has been occurring on every level and it comes down to a judgment call,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON>, deputy editorial director of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON> said reporters have to be careful not to have a nonchalant attitude about privacy rights. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McGonigle </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said he seeks colleagues' opinions when he has qualms about invading someone's privacy. `` It's foolish and arrogant of us to make decisions that affect people's lives in a vacuum, and hopefully, most of us do n't,'' <PERSON> McGonigle </PERSON> said. The group also discussed hurdles reporters face in trying to gain access to government documents and potential changes to <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> laws that are supposed to guarantee the public's access to information. For instance, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' open meetings and records law was recently changed to seal certain corporate tax documents and another effort at a `` crippling amendment'' is under way, <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> said. `` Powerful politicians are still out there and they're still our enemy,'' he said.

One fireman suffered from smoke inhalation and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he said. He said 4,000 employees were inside the building when the fire broke out. Officials did not yet know why the mattresses caught fire, he said.

 Behind the fanfare surrounding the visit of former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, there is a clear message: <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> values harmonious ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sees <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the catalyst. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' hosts, the huge <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the Japanese government, showered their guests with lavish praise during their nine-day, $ 7 million visit, which ends Saturday. Fujisankei reportedly paid <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> $ 2 million. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in turn, glossed over serious trade disputes in his speeches with expressions of affection for the Japanese people. However, in a speech scheduled to be delivered at the end of his visit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Americans did not think their products had fair access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and that trade barriers must be lowered to avoid rising anger in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` As a friend, I tell you that Americans are not as patient as the Japanese,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his speech, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Officials here have welcomed the opportunity to emphasize positive aspects of sometimes rocky U.S.-Japanese ties. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> symbolizes U.S.-Japan friendship,'' said <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s North American Division. As Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> looked on, the government showed its appreciation for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role in promoting good ties with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and in fighting trade protectionism in office by awarding him one of its highest honors, the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum. The only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to receive the award was <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been honored during the visit for her anti-drug program and for her support for her husband. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 78, is the only former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to receive such regal treatment, officials said, because unlike his predecessors who either left office in disgrace or after losing elections, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> served the two full terms and left office as a popular leader. `` There is nothing controversial about inviting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still carries high prestige among the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> said. The Reagans enjoy enormous prestige in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dignified demeanor, coupled with the image of the two former movie stars standing hand-in-hand, captures romantic imaginations in a country that revels in the pomp of lavish wedding ceremonies and royalty. At concerts, banquets and other gatherings of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rich and powerful, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have received trumpet fanfares, standing ovations and warm smiles. `` You'll never know, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, how much we need you. Please come here with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to stay,'' audience and performers sang to the tune of `` You Are My Sunshine'' on Sunday at a concert to benefit the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Presidential Library. A capacity crowd of 56,000 cheered as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tossed the ceremonial first pitch in a Japanese championship baseball game Tuesday. Rather than criticizing <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for trade barriers, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says contributed to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s $ 52 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke of a `` golden age for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' in his speeches. Trade issues, he said, were `` a few little itchy things here and there that we still need working on from both sides.'' Americans, as the world's largest foreign investors, should welcome Japanese investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> could help `` bring back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being made.''

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to distance itself from allegations made by a Salvadoran army defector that top <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> military leaders ordered death squad killings and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers ignored the activity. The White House said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is looking into the charges made this week by <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vielman </PERSON> <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 28, who admits to taking part in eight death squad murders from April to July. He claims to have seen reports from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> ordering 72 executions during the same period. <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> also said two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> advisers assigned to the intelligence unit at the 1st Infantry Brigade in the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> `` obviously had to know what was going on.'' `` We're concerned about it,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday. `` Ambassador -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is looking into it.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> departed from normal procedure of not commenting on investigations in progress. He strongly denied any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complicity and said a Salvadoran government probe into human rights abuses by its military `` has not revealed any evidence substantiating -LRB- <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s -RRB- statements.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> called the statements about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement `` patently absurd.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment, saying: `` As a matter of policy we do n't comment on intelligence matters.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces have 55 military advisers assigned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has an unknown number of agents in the Central American nation. On Friday, <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyke </PERSON>, walked from office to office on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, volunteering to testify about the death squads. Among others, he spoke with staff members of Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>, an outspoken critic of death squad activity in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The staff members declined to comment pending a report to the senator. The accusations could complicate upcoming congressional debate on new aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which so far this decade has received more than $ 3 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military assistance. Lawmakers made earlier aid contingent on human rights improvements by the Salvadoran military, which has been blamed by church groups for murdering thousands of suspected leftists and leftist sympathizers. The Salvadoran military denies <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s claims and any other involvement in the death squads. `` My work was to execute these people,'' <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, adding that he was part of a seven-man group that operated out of the Salvadoran army's 1st Infantry Brigade in the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who is seeking asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said he went public to stop the killing. The Salvadoran army says he is wanted for two murders in July in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, testimony obtained Friday said some of <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s comrades told a judge investigating the murders of two civilians that the army deserter was the most zealous of torturers who beat, drowned or suffocated prisoners. Marxist-led guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1979.

 A man walked into a government building in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> Friday, whipped out a submachine gun and killed a leftist leader of the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state assembly before being slain by guards, police said. The victim, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, was state leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, whose ranks have been decimated the last four years by death squads believed to be operated by drug traffickers. The slaying came less than 24 hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> refused to support a proposal by drug traffickers to negotiate an end to the violence that has plagued <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> since mid-August. The leftist party said it could never condone amnesty for traffickers implicated in the murders of hundreds of its members, including its president, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, in 1987. Earlier Friday, hundreds of policemen and soldiers with automatic weapons had manned checkpoints in major cities after a bomb killed five policemen and injured 16 others in the cocaine center of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Also, a police officer died in a bomb explosion at a private airport at a police air base six miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the national radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported. Unidentified terrorists fled after placing the dynamite bomb in a bathroom of the Guaymaral airport terminal, <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said. Three other bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> late Thursday and early Friday, injuring one person, and two bombs were deactivated in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, the police said. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> was sitting at his desk in the Apuajara government building in the heart of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> when he was killed at 3:30 p.m., the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police said in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, 150 miles north of this capital, is the hub of the most powerful Colombian cocaine cartel. The government building includes the offices of the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state governor, many of the state assembly members and the mayor of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a city of 2 million residents. The gunman was killed in a hail of gunfire from guards who belong to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s secret police, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of not being named. The assassin was about 20 years old, the police spokesman said. Three persons believed to be accompanying the gunman were arrested, he said. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> was the 737th member of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to be killed since the party was organized in 1975 as part of an attempt by the federal government to reach a truce with leftist guerrillas. The traffickers are believed to have set up the death squads after leftist guerrillas kidnapped the sister of three <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leaders and were paid $ 10 million for her return. A survey by a Colombian polling company showed that Colombians heavily favor the government starting talks with drug traffickers to end the violence. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has rejected such talks. The bomb in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> exploded Thursday night as a police bus carried patrolmen to their posts in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The driver and four other policemen were killed as chunks of shrapnel tore through the bus, said the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police chief, Col. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Camero </PERSON>. Afterward, the most rigid security measures seen since the government declared war on drug traffickers Aug. 19 were put into force in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s five largest cities _ <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>. An AP reporter on his way to work Friday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> was stopped at three checkpoints by soldiers and police searching cars for explosives and guns. Jeeps mounted with machine guns patrolled parts of the capital. Extra troops and policemen guarded police stations and army bases. The bomb in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, an estimated 65 pounds of dynamite, was set off by remote control about 7:30 p.m. as the police bus passed by, <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> said. With the driver fatally wounded, the bus careened out of control and smashed into a taxi, the colonel said. No one in the car was injured. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, but suspicion fell on drug traffickers. `` The traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the desire to carry out an attack of this size,'' said a police lieutenant in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, speaking on condition he not be identified. Government security forces have assumed that the scores of bombs that have exploded in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the last two months are part of the drug traffickers' campaign to persuade the government to stop extraditing trafficking suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government has extradited four Colombians, and nine more are awaiting extradition. In the last two months there have been 169 bombings, which have killed 21 people and injured 219. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, a poll by the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> indicated 61 percent of Colombians aged 18 to 60 want the government to negotiate a truce with drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Treasury Skeptical About Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says in a pessimistic assessment of trade prospects that the trade deficit may grow next year. The current account deficit, the broadest measure of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade measuring investment flows as well as payments for goods and services, narrowed sharply in 1988 to $ 126.6 billion, down from a record $ 143.7 billion in 1987. But progress has stalled this year, with the gap running at only a slightly better $ 122.8 billion annual rate from January through June. The administration, in a report prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released Friday, warned that the current account deficit may start widening again unless the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrial nations _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ do a better job of coordinating economic policies, including currency exchange rates. `` It would appear further improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account position in 1990, if any is to occur at all, is likely at best to be very modest,'' <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said in its semiannual `` Report to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policy.'' `` Furthermore, the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year can not be excluded.'' A key element in the fight to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit has been Group of Seven efforts this year to check a rise in the value of the dollar. A strong dollar can hurt the trade deficit by making <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods more expensive overseas and foreign imports cheaper on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> report acknowledged that skepticism among currency traders is hindering the effort. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> launched a new effort to contain the dollar in mid-September, which included dollar selling and interest rate increases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. However, the report noted that it took the Oct. 13 stock sell-off in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to subdue the dollar. The report was prepared under a provision of the Trade Act of 1988 that requires the administration to look for currency manipulation by American competitors in world trade and to negotiate to halt such practices. Under the law, the administration has singled out <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Friday's report expressed approval of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s effort to boost its currency and lower its trade surplus, but sharply criticized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two countries have for many years used part of the money earned through their trade surpluses to buy and sell currencies on the open market to keep their own currencies weak in relation to the dollar, making their products cheaper for Americans than they would otherwise be. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> report noted that the Taiwanese dollar has appreciated 12 percent over the past year against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. It said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> put in place a new exchange rate system in April and took other significant steps to curb its trade surplus. `` We are encouraged by -LRB- these -RRB- significant steps,'' it said. Despite an appreciation of the South Korean currency won in 1988, the report rebuked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for the 0.75 percent decline in the value of that currency since April.

 Twice a week, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> greases his 12-pound pig with hand lotion.

<TEXT>
 Calamity <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> was an `` uneducated, uncultured woman,'' and some frontier heroes were shameless bigots, according to an iconoclastic conference titled `` Speaking Ill of the Dead: Jerks in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> History.'' Nearly every event in the life of the true <ORGANIZATION> Calamity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Canary </PERSON> _ is clouded by contradictory evidence, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallacher </PERSON> told the annual <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. Even her birth date and parents' names are suspect. Much of the legend of Calamity <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> as a swashbuckling frontier woman who rode with General <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> and captured <PERSON> Wild </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON>'s killer was built by Canary herself, who fed lurid stories to newspapers that did n't care if they were true, he said Friday's panel on jerks in the state's history also featured the `` Golden Hatchet Award,'' which went to <PERSON> Lyndel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meikle </PERSON>, whose research showed that many of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s founding fathers were racist and sexist. The panel drew a crowd of nearly 200, and may become an annual part of the conference. Conference organizer <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was pleased, but also distressed that the scholarly work of the meeting would go unnoticed. The same sort of thing happened in September, she said, when a society program was upstaged by the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centennial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>. `` This is the cattle drive of the history conference,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gallacher </PERSON>, a historian with <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, said much of the legend of Calamity Jane can be flatly disproved. Her claim to have been a Cavalry scout for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> is easily debunked, he said, because <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> never served in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. And despite the many tales about her and <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON> _ including that she was married to him _ the only verifiable fact is that both were in Deadwood, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON> was shot to death in 1876. `` It was pure fantasy that she captured <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON>'s killer, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gallacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meikle </PERSON>, a ranger at the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site southwest of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, dug into official records that revealed the prejudices of delegates to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s original constitutional convention in 1889. <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s founding fathers, wanted a requirement that anyone allowed to vote should be able to read English. He saw that as a safeguard against `` the scum of foreign nations'' who were being admitted to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Meikle </PERSON> said. Delegate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> would have allowed only some foreigners to vote, but not Italians. The official transcript, <PERSON> Meikle </PERSON> said, notes that delegates laughed and applauded as <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> read an article that he said voiced his feelings: `` It is somewhat uncomfortable to reflect that a citizen of intelligence, property, good moral character and a keen sense of responsibilities and dignities of his duties as an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen may have his ballot offset by an Italian.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s prejudice against Italians was not unusual, and similar racism was aimed at the Chinese, <PERSON> Meikle </PERSON> said. Women faced different barriers, she said: `` They were not considered people.'' When a proposal to let women vote was introduced at the 1889 convention, a Mr. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> requested that its supporters first introduce a motion `` that a woman is a human being or person in the language of the court.'' `` To their credit,'' <PERSON> Meikle </PERSON> said, `` the delegates devoted a tremendous portion of their time to the debate on woman's suffrage. It is not to their credit, however, that they did n't grant it.''

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush's Drive for Tax Cut Imperiling Credit Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The long-running squabble on the proposed capital gains tax cut that continues to stymie <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on several bills has led Democrats to accuse the administration of undermining the nation's credit rating abroad by doggedly pursuing the issue. `` There apparently is no limit to what they'll do'' to get a capital-gains cut, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told reporters Friday. White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> responded to the criticism with a lecture about the need for statesmanship. `` We need people in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get back to their better selves in all of this,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. The issue is blocking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on bills to provide economic assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and to raise the federal debt limit so the government can continue to borrow money. It also is slowing work by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on a compromise bill to reduce the budget deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stepped in Friday with a plan to ensure that Social Security checks will go out next week even if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president are unable to agree on a higher debt limit. The department announced it will borrow $ 17.6 billion on an emergency basis Monday. Friday's announcement was considerably less dramatic than <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s disclosure 24 hours earlier that it was taking the unprecedented step of emergency borrowing. The earlier statement had been read as indicating $ 17 billion in new borrowing would be required Monday. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will be raising its credit needs by only $ 2 billion Monday. The remaining $ 15.6 billion will be raised in the usual Monday auctions of 3 - and 6-month securities The only difference is that buyers will have to pay for those securities Tuesday, rather than Thursday as usually would be the case. That money will be used to keep the government going after Tuesday night, when federal credit authority drops from $ 2.87 trillion to $ 2.8 trillion. The extra $ 17.6 billion from securities sales is expected to carry the government for another week, through Nov. 7. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, described the emergency borrowing as an unprecedented gamble. `` I do n't see how such an action can fail to undermine confidence in our financial operations,'' he said. He said there was no danger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would fail to raise the debt ceiling or would do anything else to jeopardize government checks for 38.9 million Social Security recipients. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., asked <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to explain his actions in writing by Monday on the unusual borrowing action `` I view this as a serious matter,'' he said in a letter to <LOCATION> Brady </LOCATION>. At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s urging, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted last month to tax capital gains _ profits from the sale of stocks and other investments _ at a lower rate than applies to wages and other income. The House attached the cut to a bill designed chiefly to reduce the budget deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans have developed, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backing, a new plan for cutting capital-gains cuts. The chief sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., says as many as 44 Republicans and 12 Democrats _ a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ favor his bill, but he acknowledges he does not have the 60 votes that would be required to end a Democratic filibuster against it

<HEAD>Earthquake Measuring 7.2 Hits Solomon Islands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shook the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> today, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey says. The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area Oct. 17. The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05 p.m. EDT Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>. It was the largest earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978. There were no immediate reports of injury or damage. Major earthquakes in the Solomons usually do n't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> said no Pacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ was generated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes in sea levels. Saturday's earthquake was the strongest in the world in five months, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said. An 8.3 quake hit the <LOCATION> Macquarie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on May 23. The survey's earthquake monitors in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said early seismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Honiaria </LOCATION>, which is on <LOCATION> Guadacanal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and is the capital of the Solomons. That places the earthquake just east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, the easternmost island in the Solomons chain and about 1,300 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

 The White House says there were some `` technical difficulties'' getting a photo of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meeting with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s aides made one available _ for a price. The price was $ 150, but it did n't show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> shaking hands. The White House said the two leaders shook hands briefly Friday as they headed into the opening session of a two-day conference of heads of government from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but declined to release a photo of the event. `` If there were a picture, we would not release it,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` It's not our story.''

<HEAD>Engineers Discovered Flaw on Other Double-Deckers Over Summer</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-SF Quake, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Engineers last summer found a seismic design flaw in three double-decker freeways in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and planned to fix them, but overlooked the similar Interstate 880 viaduct, says a top state highway engineer. Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, the oldest of the double-decker freeways in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was missed because `` nobody in the Department'' of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> remembered until after last week's earthquake that it, too, might have the flaw in its upper support column hinges, <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> chief structural engineer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said Friday Two scientific teams from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> UC-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> have tentatively decided that the hinges, or joints, sheared off during the quake allowed I-880's upper deck to slam down, killing at least 39 motorists. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was asked during a press briefing whether the repair planned for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s double-deckers would have prevented the I-880 collapse. `` The answer, I believe, is affirmative,'' he said. `` I think it would have gone a long way.'' But <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> noted that even if I-880 had been on the list, repairs would not have been done prior to Oct. 17. Hinge repairs on the three other double-deckers _ the Embarcadero, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, and Central freeways _ will be expedited, officials said. The three highways were damaged in the quake and are temporarily closed. Engineers discovered the hinge flaw in the Embarcadero freeway during an August review by seismic experts on whether the structure needed more earthquake-proofing of its horizontal decking, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. He confirmed the contents of an Aug. 21 internal memorandum brought to his attention Thursday. The memo, from one of his engineers to another, turned up in a flood of departmental documents turned over to the news media this week. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> earlier had denied its accuracy. The memo states that at <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>'s request, the other two <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> freeways would be added to the list because state engineers recalled that they too contained the flaw. Asked how engineers could have forgotten the oldest of these structures _ I-880, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, `` Maybe it was the lack of foresight.'' `` That's hindsight,'' he said later. Many of the state's 700 multicolumn structures need column bolstering, but engineers are waiting to do so until technology in the works at <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> has been developed, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Engineers plan to temporarily strengthen the three <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> structures, however, by attaching to the flawed columns `` strong backs,'' or `` splints,'' much as a physician stabilizes a leg, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. He was asked why that could not be done with all 700 elevated structures. The splints `` are not very good looking, and you're not going to leave them up permanently,'' he said.

 An Arab-American organization is planning weekend demonstrations to protest a decision by a novelty company to continue selling two Halloween masks the group finds offensive. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said members would demonstrate at <ORGANIZATION> Spencer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gifts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> outlets because the company decided to put its `` Sheik'' and `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'' masks back on the market. The Pleasantville, N.J.-based company had earlier this month withdrawn the masks for sale at its 435 outlets after a three-day protest and telephone campaign by the committee.

 In just a few seconds on Oct. 17, untold numbers of windows were shattered, trapping pedestrians in glass storms and sending shards spitting through homes and businesses. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON>'s department store alone lost 73 plate glass windows to the earthquake. Some of the windows have been replaced, some boarded up and some ignored. The amount of glass needed to help in the recovery exceeds supplies on hand in most cases and that has strained the glass pipeline. `` We are small but we lost all our stock,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Behrouz </PERSON>, office manager for <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION>, both of which closed for four days to clean up the mess left by the quake. `` We had over $ 15,000 worth of stock on hand. ... When it shook, all our glass and mirrors fell from the racks,'' he said. `` We still have n't got the -LRB- replacement -RRB- glass we need.'' `` The system is definitely strained,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, manager for National Glass. But four of the nation's big glass manufacturers are on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and replacements are on the way. No one has statistics on just how many windows shattered. <LOCATION> Libbey-Owens-Ford </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lathrop </LOCATION> began increasing shipments the day after the quake, although the company was also damaged, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zatrock </PERSON>, manager of customer service. `` We almost doubled what we would have shipped for the week.'' <PERSON> Zatrock </PERSON> said the company lost about 250,000 square feet of glass, the equivalent of 10,000 five-foot-square windows. The 7.1-magnitude quake, blamed for more than 60 deaths, more than 3,000 injuries and damage that could exceed $ 7.1 billion, was felt strongly at <LOCATION> Lathrop </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of the epicenter near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. `` There was dust everywhere,'' <PERSON> Zatrock </PERSON> said. While distributors struggled to deliver glass through a network of closed or damaged freeways, installers set up a system to handle the the most dangerous breaks first and let cracks wait. In June 1906, after the great quake ravaged <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, Habenicht and <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> opened for business to fill the demand for glass that followed. The company is having little trouble getting glass this time, although some sizes are in short supply, said manager <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>. `` There was definitely a lot of breakage. It seems like the older buildings had most of the damage. The newer buildings have thicker glass and different types of safety glass,'' Post said. In 1906, he said, `` none of the glass manufacturers were on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and the availability of glass was not what it is today. There was a lot more destruction in 1906.''

<TEXT>
 A young man opened fire with a submachine gun in a heavily guarded state government building in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, killing a leftist political leader. Hours later, a bomb exploded at a police air base near <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing a police officer. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, vice president of the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state assembly, was talking on the telephone in his office Friday when an unidentified man walked in and shot him, killing him instantly, police said. The office is on the second floor of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s main government building, which also houses the offices of the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state governor and the city's mayor. The downtown building is patrolled by scores of police officers, army troops and private security guards. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a city of two million in northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, is the capital of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and is considered the center of the country's drug trade. Guards shot and killed the assassin in an exchange of gunfire that left two officers wounded, a police spokesman said from the region. Police arrested three men suspected of assisting in the attack, he said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> also was state leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the ranks of which have been decimated in the last four years by death squads believed operated by drug traffickers. `` It was carried out by the same narcofascists that have murdered hundreds of our leaders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> said. `` The most suprising thing was that an assassin carrying a submachine gun could walk into the most heavily guarded government building in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>.'' Hours after the slaying, a bomb exploded at a police air base and private airport six miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing a police officer, according to the national radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. Unidentified terrorists fled after placing the dynamite bomb in a bathroom of the Guaymaral airport terminal, <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said. It also caused extensive damage to the building. Police are using the small, private airport to store many light aircraft seized from suspected drug traffickers in a government crackdown on narcotics that began in August. A <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police spokesman could not confirm the bombing because communication with the airport was cut, he said. Earlier Friday, the government announced it would increase to $ 600,000 the reward offered for information leading to the arrest of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, two leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. In August the administration of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> offered $ 250,000 for information leading to the suspects' capture. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and a rival organization in southern <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> are responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government declared a crackdown on drug traffickers on Aug. 19, a day after leading presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, was assassinated by drug barons. The government reinstated an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and began confiscating property belonging to the drug lords. Traffickers responded with bombings and assassinations in an effort to persuade the government led by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to end its extradition of drug suspects. The administration has extradited four alleged traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where they will face trial. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, drug lords have received relative impunity by paying off or intimidating the nation's judges. On Thursday, five patrolmen died and 16 were injured when a bomb attributed to traffickers exploded beside a bus carrying them to their night posts in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Security was stepped up nationwide as a result of the bombing. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Friday, military checkpoints were increased and jeeps mounted with machine guns patrolled the streets.

 The third game of the World Series played to a captive audience in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters, where televisions were set up for baseball fans left homeless by the earthquake. `` This is definitely not the place I'd like to watch the game,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 53, as he sat on a cot in the crowded gymnasium of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` But due to the circumstances, it's not so bad,'' the A's fan said. `` If it was n't for this place, I would n't be watching at all.'' Sounds of an ebullient Candlestick Park crowd blasted out from the TV, echoing to every corner of the cavernous gym, where 120 cots were lined up side by side. Some officials questioned the wisdom of resuming the World Series while some people remain homeless in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. But in the shelters, baseball fans were happy to watch the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> 13-7, calling it a welcome break from what they called depressing footage of destruction. `` We love it; It takes your mind off the earthquake, and that's good for the nerves,'' said <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, 54, as he sat with a cluster of A's fans When the earthquake hit last week, <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> was just about to turn on the televised game in his room on the third floor of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s low-rent <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON>. He'd have preferred to be there watching Friday's game. But his quake-damaged building was condemned, <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> was forced into the shelter, and his TV was stolen before he was allowed back to his room to pick up his belongings. Not everyone in the shelter was glued to the television during Friday's game. Many people milled around their cots; others escaped the shelter's smelly, noisy confines to enjoy the crisp, clear evening outside. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 48, lay disconsolate on his cot, far from the blaring set. `` I ca n't watch the game because of my heart,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> complained that officials were giving him the run-around in finding a more permanent place to stay and in supplying him with the prescription drug he needs for his heart condition. The World Series held no magic for him: `` All I want is a place to stay.''

 The meat was offbeat, the diners chic, but picketers outside the New Deal Restaurant were in a pique. It was the place to be Friday night. Where else in town could you find sweet and sour ostrich, kangaroo yakitori and beaver empanada on the menu, with animal rights activists chanting, `` Lion's tongue is no fun'' in the street? The restaurant's <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> attracted customers who wanted to savor a rare taste treat. It also drew the attention of an animal rights group that protested in front of the restaurant, shouting slogans such as, `` Wild game is not a treat.'' `` This is symbolic of the really decadent, disrespectful attitude that, unfortunately, our society exhibits,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> of Trans-Species Unlimited. `` Some of them are endangered animals. They're making a game out of it, making a fun experience out of the suffering of these animals.'' The kangaroo meat served by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> is marinated in soy sauce and grilled with scallions. The `` Drunken Diamondback Rattlesnake'' is pan-roasted with cilantro -LRB- coriander -RRB- and bell peppers and then baked in tequila and lime. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, regulars at the eatery in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> SoHo </LOCATION> area, were seated at the bar Friday night `` We had zebra once, which was quite delicious,'' said <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>. `` They have some things here that you ca n't get in other places in the city and it's very tasty and very well prepared.'' As the protestors continued their chanting, chef <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> and restaurant partner <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Riezenman </PERSON> lamented that the demonstrators were misinformed. `` They think we're doing something illegal,'' said <PERSON> Riezenman </PERSON>. `` Everything is sanctioned by the government. No one drives up here in a truck with three deer on the back of the truck and dumps it out on the street.'' Added <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>: `` We too, are concerned with the protection of our wildlife. We do not feature endangered species. ... Our exotic meats come from preserves whose sole purpose is to raise these animals for consumption.'' But protester <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailer </PERSON> was unimpressed. `` Those animals do n't belong on a plate. They belong on the open fields or the jungle,'' she said, as she took up a new chant, `` Beaver, moose and ostrich, too. New Deal Restaurant shame on you.'' Game will be on the menu until January and chef <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> intends to hold the festival again next year _ especially with the popularity of high-protein, low-cholesterol food. `` It's a healthier product than the meat you get in most restaurants,'' he said. `` In here, you're not eating animals that are all pumped up with hormones or antibiotics.'' But how can anyone eat kangaroo? a visitor asked. `` It's like filet mignon,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said. But every taste bud has its limits. `` I particularly have a morbid fear of snakes and I've never eaten it and I probably never will,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said.

<BYLINE>Doctor Sounds Alarm Over Homeless Pregnant Women ^By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

 <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> is a 20-year-old mother with another child due in February. She is also one of six pregnant homeless women to enter <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in just 10 days. The distress of such women represents a surge so alarming it prompted Dr. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at <LOCATION> Beth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to call Friday for more attention to the needs of homeless pregnant women. `` Now this may be a statistical quirk. But I'm just outraged. What kind of a society is this?'' he said. `` I've never seen this number before. I hear about a case once in a blue moon, perhaps once or twice a year,'' said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, who has worked in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospitals for 11 years. `` In some ways it must be coincidence. But it's highlighted by the times, when I read the headlines, I have to make an outcry.'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said that among the six pregnant homeless women, two have already given birth. One of those two women left her child behind at the hospital to be put in foster care. And there is Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a diabetic who has a 3-year-old daughter and has been homeless since July. The stress made her so ill she checked into <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>. `` It's a lot of pressure,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said in an interview from the hospital, where the staff is helping her obtain a state housing subsidy _ a difficult feat at a time of budget cuts. `` I see mothers every day, put out every day from the shelters and I see them prostituting to feed their children,'' she said. `` It's very scary because you do n't know what's going to happen the next day,'' she said. `` It's also, in a way, very painful. My 3-year-old wakes up crying wondering where she is.'' The size of the problem is difficult to gauge. Many homeless pregnant women might not disclose their predicament, for fear of having their children placed in foster care, <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> said. But in a report soon to be released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, a survey of 26 communities, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, found that more than 35 percent of the homeless were families with children, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alker </PERSON>, a legislative analyst in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the coalition. While no statistics were collected specifically on homeless women giving birth, <PERSON> Alker </PERSON> said, `` The fastest growing segment of the homeless population is families with children.

 Six former secretaries of state agreed that rapid political changes in the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> pose tough foreign policy questions for the West, but they could n't say whether the Cold War is dead. `` We should n't be incessantly euphoric about all the welcome changes,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> told the panel discussion. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said they did not believe the Cold War was over, despite warmer ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and displays of nationalism and changes in leadership in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> said the Cold War was `` maybe'' over. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, `` I'm closer to a yes,'' while <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said, `` It's ending.'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, who served under former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said such developments as the non-communist leadership in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the exodus from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> indicate a demise of the Cold War mentality. `` In the Cold War, these could never have happened,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. The former officials met Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for the seventh annual Report of the Secretaries of State, presented by the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would say it's ending, but we're not out of the Cold War,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. The secretaries agreed that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform efforts are welcome, but they were not sure what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders can or should do to assist `` Nobody knows what perestroika is, including <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, so nobody knows what we're supposed to be supporting,'' said <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who served under former presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. Trying to help <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could backfire by causing him political problems at home, some of the speakers said. `` The best we can do is assist Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the margins,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> senator who also served as secretary of state under <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, suggested that the Soviets need to help integrate themselves with the economies of the West by making the ruble exchangeable with other currencies. Asked whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is responding quickly enough to the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he would like to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speed up his reactions, while <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> encouraged a cautious approach. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, a retired diplomat, ambassador and arms control negotiator, Friday expressed a lack of trust in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying the Soviet leader is `` very good at keeping people deceived as to what he's going to do next.'' <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has essentially become a `` one-man dictator.'' `` Nobody can stand up to him today,'' said <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, `` and I do n't approve of one-man dictatorships even if they might look as though they're heading in a benevolent direction toward their own people You never can tell about dictators. `` We want to be sure that the things that he's suggesting do, in fact, take place ... before we let down our guard,'' <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> said before a speech to the World Affairs Center, a group of businessmen and civic leaders interested in foreign policy. The 82-year-old <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, who served as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s adviser on arms control, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on April 30 and now is diplomat in residence at the <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nitze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>

 As firefighters doused smoldering buildings, a caravan of buses ferried 960 inmates from the scorched <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> prison to other crowded facilities in the state today after two nights of rioting. The siege left more than 100 people injured, numerous buildings razed or damaged by fire and hundreds of inmates without cells. Five hostages were released Friday morning after state police stormed the prison and retook it building by building. `` It looks like a riot-torn city in there,'' said firefighter <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. With large areas of the prison gutted or damaged, officials had little choice but to begin shuttling busloads of inmates to other state prisons _ all of which are already full beyond capacity. Prison officials said overcrowding at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> may have been a cause for the riots. There were no deaths and no escapes during the uprising at the prison in south-central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, officials said. The violence was sparked Wednesday by an inmate's assault on a prison worker. That led to a seven-hour rampage during which eight hostages were taken and 47 injured. Officials regained control of the prison and the hostages were released, but by 7 p.m. Thursday the inmates managed to free themselves from lockdown and began the second night of rioting. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said officials are unsure how the inmates freed themselves. There has been speculation inmates still had keys gained in the first night of rioting or took advantage of locks damaged the first night. The siege's end came Friday morning, when state police, firing guns, stormed a kitchen building, wounding at least one inmate as they began taking control of the prison. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> announced about 9:30 a.m. that officials were `` again in control of the institution,'' nearly 15 hours after the second wave of rioting began. Fourteen of 31 buildings on the grounds were burned out, including eight modular housing units, the education building, greenhouse, laundry building and furniture factory, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. During their storming of the prison, state police in riot gear and armed with shotguns pushed surrendering or captured prisoners to the ground, holding them face-down in the grass of a prison courtyard. Troopers who spoke on the condition of anonymity detailed hand-to-hand scuffles and counterattacks by inmates. `` They were throwing Molotov cocktails at us and pieces of blocks,'' said one trooper. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said 76 people were injured Thursday, and 46 were taken to hospitals. They included 34 prison employees, 32 inmates and 10 state police or firefighters. All five hostages taken Thursday night were injured. One was in serious condition with a stab wound, three were in stable condition with head injuries or, in one case, broken ribs, and one was in good condition with a head injury, he said. An 18-year-old inmate was in critical condition, a 24-year-old inmate was in serious condition and a third inmate of undetermined age was in fair condition, all with gunshot wounds, area hospital officials said. A 41-year-old guard was listed in serious condition at the medical center after undergoing surgery for multiple stab wounds to the back, <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marybeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruchwalski </PERSON> said. Friday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said 960 inmates from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> would be moved to the <LOCATION> Graterford </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Waymart </LOCATION> state prisons. Overcrowding and a shortage of guards may have contributed to the disturbance, officials said. <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, with 2,600 inmates, was about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state prison system is about 48 percent over capacity. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said both a prison administrative and a criminal investigation have begun to determine what happened during the outburst. The state's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plans a hearing next week. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> had said the first night's problems may have been linked to a decision to prohibit families from bringing food to inmates during extended visits. He also said inmates were upset by a change in the way they received medical care.

 Candlestick Park shook again but it was the roar of fans cheering the World Series _ not another earthquake _ and the only cracks came from bats as the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area took a break from its woes to watch baseball. `` The city's back, just like the World Series,'' <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnos </ORGANIZATION> declared to the television audience before the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> pounded his <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> 13-7 Friday night to take a 3-0 lead in the series. It was the loss of the TV signal shortly before Game 3 was to begin 10 days earlier that gave the nation its first hint of the powerful temblor that rocked northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, killing scores and causing widespread damage. `` We're well on the way to recovery although it's early yet because there have been so many aftershocks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The 62,000 fans stood silently to remember victims of the 7.1-magnitude quake that hit at 5:04 p.m. Oct. 17, then jubilantly sang `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'' before a dozen rescue workers were given the honor of throwing out first balls. Not everyone thought the Bay Bridge World Series should resume in the face of the enormity of the tragedy: 64 deaths, six people unaccounted for, nearly 14,000 people homeless and an estimated $ 7.1 billion in damage. But major-league baseball thought it was time to play ball, and many fans agreed. `` We all feel bad for the people who got hurt, but this game means it's OK to be yourself again,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, who with a friend had seats near the top of the stadium and brought a banner that read, `` Upper deck parachute rental.'' Many fans wore hard hats to the game. `` I think enough time has passed so that we can put it behind us,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Franchetti </PERSON> at a tailgate party in the same spot where he had been on Oct. 17. `` It's an escape from the sadness and uncertainty.'' Commissioner <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who announced a $ 1.4 million gift from baseball to earthquake relief, said he received mail from around the country urging that the Series be called off because of the earthquake. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said he understood those feelings. `` But I do n't think there is any disrespect in going on with the World Series,'' he said. `` Baseball can be part of this area's mental therapy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. The death toll rose to 64 on Friday with the addition of an 88-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> woman who died of a heart attack shortly after the quake. Demolition continued at Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> where 39 people were known to have been killed in the collapse of the double-deck freeway. The search for more more bodies was delayed because the road was too shaky. In other quake developments: _ Dockworker Buck Helm, 57, rescued after four days trapped in the rubble of I-880, remained in serious condition in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>'s Highland General Hospital Helm was making `` slow progress'' in kidney and respiratory functions, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> said late Friday. _ <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, 6, whose leg was amputated during a rescue from I-880, was in good condition at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. A nursing supervisor said late Friday that he was to be moved from intensive care to a regular ward. His sister <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, 8, was in serious but stable condition. They lost their mother in the collapse. About $ 48,000 has been donated to a fund for them. _ In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> on Friday, a wrecking ball went to work on the landmark <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, centerpiece of the heavily damaged <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>. Some people watched with tears in their eyes. _ Lawyer <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> on Friday filed $ 22 million in claims against the state on behalf of 10 victims of the I-880 collapse. If the claims _ $ 3 million for each of two wrongful deaths and $ 2 million for each of eight injured survivors _ are rejected by the state, lawsuits would be filed, <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> said. _ Seven students from <ORGANIZATION> Chuo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> on Friday to help distribute relief supplies in the hard-hit agricultural region. An additional 25 students will arrive Wednesday. _ The state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> warned tour operators that earthquake disaster areas should not be considered tourist attractions, and threatened punitive action against any operator who toured there. _ A convention of traumatic stress experts who coincidentally came to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after the earthquake held a seminar on the disaster Friday. Experts said people should talk about the experience and use jokes to relieve stress.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has quietly stopped flooding part of its cease-fire line with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, ending a yearlong dispute between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> over the truce violation. The flooding had sparked the deadliest shelling across the line since the 1988 cease-fire that effectively ended the 8-year Persian Gulf War. Under the truce, the two armies are not allowed to strengthen their positions. The news came Friday as new mediation efforts began to break a deadlock in peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to `` work constructively and in a spirit of good will'' with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> who Monday begins a three-week shuttle diplomacy mission between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Diplomats said water levels along the 40-mile-long area northeast of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> dropped dramatically over the last two to three weeks, and parts of the marsh are now dry. They said they were not sure why <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had stopped the flooding, which began three weeks after the cease-fire to drive <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops from positions they occupy in Iranian territory. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not commented on the move. In September 1988 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> opened a large canal, turning the marshy region into swampland beneath 4 -LCB- feet of water, making it impassable for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> tanks or armored vehicles, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called the flooding a serious violation of the cease-fire agreement and tension over the raised water levels provoked shelling in December 1988 that killed two Iranians. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> `` is not taking specific proposals, but will be listening to all parties concerned who will be available to him.'' The war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> tentatively ended with a truce effective Aug. 20, 1988. But peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> quickly bogged down. An uneasy truce prevails along the 350-mile war front, and the warring armies are separated by a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> says that since hostilities have ceased, all prisoners of war should immediately be exchanged, according to the terms of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 governing the treatment of POWS. About 100,000 prisoners still languish in POW camps. But <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> insists the next step in the peace process must be the withdrawal of troops to the border. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> still occupies about 385 square miles of Iranian territory.

 Former colleagues of a Salvadoran army deserter who told <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials about death-squad assassinations testified the man was a zealous torturer who initiated the killings. The testimony, obtained Friday, was given in recent weeks to Judge <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quetzaltepeque </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vielman </PERSON> <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who deserted from the San Salvador-based 1st <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> in July, met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He has said he was part of a rightist death squad responsible for killing 72 suspected leftists. The government and armed forces deny the existence of military death squads. <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after being charged with the deaths of suspected left-wing guerrillas <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, who were killed after being captured by <PERSON> Joya </PERSON>'s army brigade. In the testimony Col. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, 1st Brigade commander, called <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> `` a deserter, a murderer and a liar.'' <PERSON> Joya </PERSON>, 28, told reporters on Thursday, `` My work was only to execute these people. My job was to kill or be killed ... I realize I was manipulated.'' He said some of the people he killed `` were almost dead from being beaten during interrogation.'' But <PERSON> Joya </PERSON>'s former army colleagues told the judge that <PERSON> Joya </PERSON>, an army intelligence officer, was the most zealous of torturers who beat, drowned or suffocated prisoners. <PERSON> Parada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> were among eight guerrilla suspects captured during an operation around the village of Tres Ceibas. Soldiers who took part in the operation testified that all eight were beaten and several were almost drowned by <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> over two days of interrogation, even though the battalion commander had said they were not to be tortured. Lt. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlacatl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> company operating north of the capital, reportedly warned <PERSON> Joya </PERSON>, who replied, `` If I do n't, they wo n't tell us anything.'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> and another soldier, <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> told <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> after the deaths, `` You're in big trouble.'' <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> said a squad from his company accompanied <PERSON> Joya </PERSON> in making the arrests at <ORGANIZATION> Tres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ceibas </ORGANIZATION> but their `` only mission was to give security to the two 1st Brigade soldiers so they could perform their intelligence-gathering duty.'' An estimated 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 10-year-old war between leftist rebels and U.S.-backed governments. Human rights groups have said rightist death squads _ allegedly sponsored or tolerated by the military _ killed more than 20,000 suspected leftists in the early 1980s. The number of slayings attributed to the squads declined between 1984 and 1987 but increased again last year.

 A woman whose imprisonment for hiring a gunman to kill her husband led to changes in state laws protecting battered women was free today on a grant of clemency. <PERSON> Delia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> blinked back tears as she walked through prison gates Friday afternoon, saying her prayers for mercy and understanding had been answered. `` The governor put trust in me and I'm not going to let him down,'' she told reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> Purdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Women. <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> had served about 22 months of a 10 year, three-month sentence for hiring a hit man to kill her husband <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, granting the first clemency order of his five years in office, said <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> and her four children had suffered enough and society would n't be threatened by her early release. <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Defender <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who defended <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON>, called the clemency order `` an extraordinary act, done for an extraordinary case ... There is room in our law and room in our hearts for forgiveness and understanding.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said he did not condone <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON>'s action but felt the order would increase public awareness of the tragedy of spouse abuse. `` My first thought was I'd be united with my children,'' <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> told reporters outside the prison, 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` We've been through a lot in the past. Due to our separation, we've suffered a lot. When I got word I would be free I thought I finally will be home with my kids ... I had faith it was going to happen.'' <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> was met at the gates by her 16-year-old daughter <PERSON> Dominga </PERSON>. The two left the prison together to join two of her other children at <ORGANIZATION> Hickman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> transition house for battered women. Her fourth child will join the family at a later date, said <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Maffeo </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Hickman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one condones or approves the action taken to end years of abuse,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` This is not a pardon. This is not sending the message you can take the law into in your own hands.'' <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> beat and threatened his wife and the children, caused a miscarriage, chopped off her hair, raped her, put a gun to her head, threatened to drown her, and sexually, physically and psychologically abused the children. <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> said her attempts to flee, to get police protection, or to get any extensive help from shelters for battered women were fruitless and she felt she had no alternative but to have her husband killed. She admitted hiring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Earls </PERSON>, 22, to shoot her husband in their family home in <LOCATION> Sedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woolley </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, on March 31, 1987, while she and the children were upstairs. She agreed to give Earls $ 200, a VCR that did n't work and an old <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> that did n't work. Earls is serving a 30-year prison term. <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> initially was charged with aggravated first-degree murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty. But after she detailed the years of abuse, the charge was reduced to second-degree murder and she pleaded guilty. At the time <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> faced trial, evidence of a history of abuse could be used as a defense only if the person killed the abuser in self-defense during an actual or imminent attack. Prompted by her case, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a measure giving lighter sentences to abuse victims who strike back at their tormenters.

<HEAD>Prince Launches Architecture School</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the architecture critic who would be king, has set up a summer school to promote his own ideas about design. The first five-week Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>' Summer School in Civil Architecture will be held next summer, according to an announcement Friday from <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which is administering the postgraduate course. Architecture students from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who have completed at least their bachelor's degrees will be eligible to apply for 24 places in the course, which will include three weeks in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and two weeks in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Students will pay $ 1,600 for the course. All other costs will be met by funds raised privately by the prince, who is expected to visit the course and may attend some of the classes, according to <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON>, the school's director. In the course prospectus, Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> writes that architecture students are not properly exposed to classical design. `` Those rare students courageous enough to pursue this approach on their own are sometimes browbeaten by their tutors; luckier ones are merely ridiculed as freaks,'' the prince wrote. The course will concentrate on four disciplines: civic design and building codes; invention and design within codes; building materials and craft; and life drawing. `` Learning to draw the subtleties of the human body is the time-honored way of tutoring the hand in the delicate lines of beauty and harmonic proportion,'' the prospectus said. <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> decided to sponsor a school after he spent two years working on a television documentary, `` A Vision of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' in which the heir to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s throne toured the country praising neoclassical design and pointing out architectural `` carbuncles.'' An exhibition at the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Museum </PERSON> and a book, both titled `` A Vision of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' elaborated on the principles that will be the basis for the summer school. Some prominent architects have taken sharp exception to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' architectural enthusiasms, but `` A Vision of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'' is now on the bestseller list In the course prospectus, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> writes that design students need to realize the role their buildings will play within their environments. `` The philosophy of designing buildings from the inside out has had the effect of tearing apart the fabric of our cities in a jostling scrum of buildings of outlandish shapes and materials and all kinds of heights and sizes screeching for attention like a classroom of unruly children,'' he wrote. Some of the money for the school is expected to come from the 1851 Exhibition Fund. The Great Exhibition was the brainchild of Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s husband, and made a considerable profit from the crowds who came to see wonders such as the Crystal Palace.

 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has the healthiest population of the 50 states and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> the sickest, according to a nationwide study that seems to show higher elevations and northern lattitudes are better for the body. The compilation of statistics from public and private health groups showed people who live in most <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states are healthier than residents of the Southeast and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> residents live an average of 2 -LCB- years longer than residents of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, according to the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Many of the states that show up at the bottom of the list are n't the ones most people would expect. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, for example, has one of the highest life expectancies, but poor health habits bring it down to 44th place,'' said <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON>, head of the insuror's health care division. `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, in spite of its high median income, ranked 48th, due to the highest level of disease in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, winding up a nine-day visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said today that Americans do not feel their products have fair access to Japanese markets and called for a Pacific free trade zone. Addressing 400 prominent businessmen in the western port of <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` put this step-by-step bickering behind us and embrace a trade vision that is encompassing.'' `` We are the two greatest economic powers in the world,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Let us leap beyond our no-win squabbling by undertaking a breathtaking plan ... a free trade zone between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' In earlier appearances during his current visit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> glossed over trade disputes to emphasize positive aspects of bilateral ties. Today, he took direct aim at Japanese policy. Americans admire <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said, but `` Sixty-eight percent of Americans find the economic threat from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to be a more serious threat ... than the military threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` The notion is wrong,'' but Americans believe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products do not get fair access in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> enjoyed a $ 52 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the principle of fairness had been a `` very strong strain'' among Americans, referring to the unfair treatment from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that provoked the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1773. `` We do n't want a Japanese tea party,'' he said. In another criticism of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s policies, the former president warned <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faced possible boycotts of its products over practices of drift-net fishing and logging in tropical rain forests. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Oct. 20, left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 chartered by their hosts, the <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest media conglomerate. They shared the jet with 230 family members of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who hitched a free ride with them to the Orient. The Reagans, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the invitation of the government and Fujisankei, have not commented on reports <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will receive about $ 2 million for his appearances on television and at charitable events during his visit. Fujisankei reportedly spent $ 7 million on the entire visit, which has been seen as an opportunity to improve <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> SEATTLE </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> _ A crowd of hundreds watched as radical <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans torched 1,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags in a `` festival of defiance'' early today minutes after a federal law prohibiting desecration of the flag went into effect. Alternately chanting `` Burn, baby, burn'' and singing the national anthem, the crowd cheered as members of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Against the War-Anti-Imperialist torched a pile of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags shortly after midnight. On Friday, four cloth flags were burned in a protest at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a flag burning at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was halted when a passerby snuffed the flames with his bare hands. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the law encourages the very action it's intended to discourage. `` There were no incidents of public flag burning in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the prohibition,'' she said. `` Liberty needs special protection, not its symbol, the flag.'' The law took effect at 12:01 a.m.. One thousand flags _ one large and most of the rest the size of a large postage stamp _ were burned in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> protest, organizers said The demonstration was held in front of a post office and the flag hanging on a pole outside the building was lowered, doused with lighter fluid and set afire. `` We're burning the flag to say we will not stand by to see forced patriotism. Abridgement of the First Amendment right -LRB- of free speech -RRB- is the first infringement,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1970-71. No voices were raised in opposition to torching the flags. Flag-burnings were conducted in other cities Friday. In <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Stop the Flag Amendment and Laws burned cloth flags and handed out small paper flags mounted on toothpicks and asked bystanders to set them ablaze. `` As we all know, the flag is just a symbol, a piece of cloth; even the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld that position,'' attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON>, vice president of the Bay Area chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, said at the demonstration. <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> did not burn any flags at the protest. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Crank </PERSON> nearly got his hands singed when he broke up a protest at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> by rubbing out the flames of a burning flag with his bare hands. `` My father served in World War II,'' Crank shouted after grabbing the flag. `` I'm not going to let what he did go by the wayside so that you can burn this flag.'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Krutz </PERSON>, a freelance writer who organized the protest, said he was pleased with the impromptu debate that the partial flag-burning had generated. `` We were n't eager to burn a flag in the first place,'' he said. `` We have a high respect for the flag. We have a higher respect for freedom.'' Burning one flag is punishable by a $ 1,000 fine and up to a year in jail. The new law was passed by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month in response to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that struck down a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law making it illegal to burn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. The law is subject to judicial review. Opponents and supporters have said that if the court overturns the law, there will be new pressure to amend the Constitution to allow <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the states to ban flag desecration.

 They will still use No. 2 pencils to fill in the oval blanks, but the ACT tests administered today to aspiring college students have undergone their first overhaul since the American College Testing Program began in 1959. `` There is more of an emphasis than ever on the ability of a student to think and apply and problem-solve with the new test rather than just to recall some fact or piece of information,'' ACT President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said `` well over'' 300,000 students are registered to take the Enhanced ACT Assessment test nationwide today. Most colleges in 28 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states weigh the ACT test results in their application procedures. The new ACT test includes 215 questions and takes 2 hours and 55 minutes to complete. The old test had 219 questions and took 2 hours and 40 minutes. Work on the new exam began seven or eight years ago and ACT officials have studied, surveyed and tested it over the last three or four years, <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` There wo n't be surprises for us,'' he said. `` We know how it will work.'' The new test will give more detailed information on students to high schools and colleges, <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. The English section includes questions that measure a student's awareness of decisions a person makes when writing, including style and audience The range of questions has increased in the math section to include easier and more difficult questions and has been lengthened by 10 questions and 10 minutes. The new reading section includes fiction and readings in the humanities. The knowledge-of-facts items have been dropped from the Science Reasoning section, which now focuses on the process of science. The section still includes material from science areas covered in high school. The enhanced test also includes subscores in English, math and reading, which the old test did not compile. ACT officials expect higher scores but say it is not easier. `` On the average, the test will not be more difficult than it was before. We are simply testing some different things,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. Overall scoring has changed so that a 15 composite score last year might be comparable to an 18 composite this year, officials said. The range is from 1 to 36.

 The hopes of striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers have been bolstered by congressional support of an investigation into the carrier's labor dispute. `` I think it's a tremendous boost,'' said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, spokesman for Eastern pilots. Company officials expressed confidence Friday that the congressional commission bill, which first must go before a conference committee to resolve minor differences with a House-passed version, will be vetoed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The administration has said it does not want to become involved in a labor-management dispute. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, on a 65-35 vote, Thursday approved its version of a bill to create a commission to resolve the strike affecting about 30,000 machinists, flight attendants and pilots who have been off the job since early March. Eastern, which plans to add 75 flights next week as it rebuilds without its unions, has been investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, and the congressional commission is unnecessary, spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` We've been throughly investigated, and we've always come through with flying colors,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union District 100, said he has more confidence in a congressional investigation than the past probes, which he said were whitewashes. `` They've controlled the investigations before. I do n't think they feel quite as confident about this one,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, whose union, representing mechanics, ramp agents and baggage handlers, walked out March 4 and was joined by the pilots and flight attendants unions at Eastern. Under the bill, a Democrat and Republican from each house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be appointed by their respective leaders and over 45 days would investigate the Eastern situation. They would make recommendations on how to resolve the strike, and also on how to preserve competitiveness in the airline industry and how to protect employees' rights during bankruptcy protection. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days after the strike began. The union struck after federal mediation failed to resolve their contract dispute. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was empowered to intervene then, but refused. The dispute is over proposed wage cuts and work-rule changes, but the unions charge that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which bought Eastern in 1986, planned all along to break <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions while siphoning off its assets to the parent company. Eastern on Wednesday will increase its daily flights to 775 and is aiming to fly 1,000 daily flights by midspring. Eastern had nearly 1,100 daily flights when the strike began.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said it would contact Wall Street brokerages about reforming computerized program trading rules after three major firms dropped the strategy. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two of the biggest users of program trading, said Friday they would stop using a form of the strategy known as index arbitrage to trade for their own accounts. <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also stopped using the strategy. <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which manages more than $ 8.6 billion in assets, stopped doing business with brokerages that conduct program trading _ becoming the third large institution to do so this week. `` Certainly as a marketplace that has almost 47 million individual investors we have got to be concerned about anything that might be harmful to those constituent users,'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> to place new limits on index arbitrage, while <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ which abandoned the strategy earlier this year _ sent a sharply critical letter to more than 2 million clients. The outcry follows a return of volatile market price swings in recent weeks, including the 190-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 13 and an 85-point morning drop this past Monday. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, two major institutional investors, said they would no longer buy or sell stock through brokerages that conduct index arbitrage. <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> followed suit Friday. Index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy aimed at profiting on brief and minute differences between prices of stocks and stock-index futures, which are traded on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures exchanges. The trading tactic, in which millions of shares can be bought or sold in seconds, often is geared to make short-term gains in excitable markets.

<BYLINE>Bacon Turns 80, Hailed as Britain's Greatest Living Artist ^By

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, acknowledged by his fellow painters as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s greatest living artist, turns 80 today and told a caller: `` I'm not celebrating it. I'm not going anywhere and I do n't want any presents.'' Then he hung up. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> is known for being difficult. He prefers the company of a very few friends, with whom he chats in bars and restaurants. He suffers badly from asthma, which prevented him from visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last fall when he became the first living Western artist to be honored with a retrospective exhibition there. On Thursday night, <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> failed to attend the private viewing of a loan exhibition of 15 of his works to mark his birthday at his agents, <LOCATION> Marlborough </LOCATION> Fine Art in <LOCATION> Albemarle </LOCATION> street off Piccadilly. But he did show up Friday morning. `` He looked very well _ he's still painting of course,'' said a member of the staff. Bacon paints disquieting and disturbing pictures of people, dogs and carcasses in rooms that look like torture chambers. His work portrays the world in anguish. One of his favorite images is the 17th century Pope Innocent X in a famous portrait by <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> took over the <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> and on several canvases depicted the pope caged in plate glass and screaming. `` I wanted to record the human cry, the whole coagulation of pain and despair,'' he has said of his work. A Bacon painting titled `` Triptych May-June'' was auctioned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in May for $ 6.27 million, a record for any living British artist. `` He is one of the most inspirational of European artists,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, who selected the Bacon retrospective at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Tate Gallery in 1984. The curator said a current exhibition of new paintings by <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Hirshorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, `` shows no diminuition of his qualities or abilities _ in fact they look stronger than in some of his earlier work.'' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> but is regarded as a British painter because he has lived in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> since he was 16. He destroyed much of his early work and his surviving paintings of the 1930s show the influence of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>. `` Because of <LOCATION> Bacon </LOCATION>, the art world has taken British art seriously,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s former justice minister said the entire international community must help her nation battle its drug barons, and could start by helping to pay for reforms of the Colombian justice system. <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, 32, served only 70 days as her nation's top law enforcement official before resigning last month amid threats from traffickers and fleeing with her family to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Dozens of plainclothes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officers stood guard Friday as she addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, her first public speech since leaving office. `` I am not in favor of a dialogue -LRB- with drug traffickers -RRB-, and I upheld that policy in the time I served as a minister,'' Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said. `` And I believe that continues to be the policy.'' Instead, she said the international community must cease feuding over whether the drug problem is one of producing or consuming nations and form a united front against drugs. `` Our societies have been challenged by this invisible enemy, a common enemy,'' said Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiff </PERSON>. `` There is no historical precedent for this kind of war.'' Neither the Opium Wars in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the last century nor the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experiment with Prohibition in the 1920s created problems of the current magnitude, she said. `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> can not continue to fight alone with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as its only partner,'' said Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>. She said one concrete step would be for the international financial community to smooth the way for a $ 40 million loan to modernize and protect <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s beleaguered judicial branch. Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> resigned at the height of drug-related violence sparked by the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. Her resignation was widely attributed to repeated death threats, but she has said she quit because President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> wanted to replace her. Since leaving office, Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> has been living in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> with her husband, Argentine public relations consultant <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, and their 3-year-old son.

 When <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was taken hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985, his high school classmates were planning their 20th reunion. Now they're planning their 25th reunion and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s release seems no closer, said classmate <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> at ceremonies Friday in the town where the hostage grew up. Friends and family unveiled a flag-draped statue of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and sang `` Amazing Grace'' to mark the hostage's 42nd birthday, his fifth in captivity. `` It was a tearful moment,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Zickl </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> coordinator for the <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> family's efforts to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was taken captive in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 U.S.-backed rebels have blocked a key highway for seven days, cutting flour and fuel shipments to the capital, government soldiers said today. Soldiers said heavy fighting had broken out on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, just north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on the southern slope of the massive Hindu Kush mountains. For the past three nights, government forces have launched dozens of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets at the highway from bases in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the private news agency <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported that government planes had bombed a 40-mile stretch of the highway to push through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supplies headed for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The rebel alliance's official news organ said, however, it could not confirm the attacks The government troops said more than 1,500 trucks carrying food and weapons were backed up on the highway. They said shipments of fuel and food from <LOCATION> Harytan </LOCATION>, on the Soviet border, had stopped and more than 18,000 metric tons of gasoline and oil are waiting at the border town for shipment. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said some of the supplies on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> road were from a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> shipment of Finnish aid which entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last week. But he said it took up only several trucks. Most of the aid is going to poor families in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In the capital, government forces have been launching scores of rockets north in the direction of the highway. On Friday night the sky was streaked red with flames from the rocket boosters as they sped north. Seconds later the sky would be bright orange, with explosions lighting up the black hills. Government and private markets have been without flour, the main grain of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, since mid-week. The city, however, is not in immediate danger. Silos holding 50,000 metric tons of grain are reportedly full. The <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> road is the only land route through which a substantial amount of commodities have passed recently. The road east to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is `` open one day, closed the next,'' said one soldier. The road south to <LOCATION> Logram </LOCATION> is effectively closed to government traffic as is the road west to <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Antonov-12 supply planes from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have arrived at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s international airport over the past few days. But each plane can only carry about 30 tons each. Gasoline prices are skyrocketing in the city, going as high as 6,500 Afghanis -LRB- $ 13.25 -RRB- a gallon. When asked where the flour is, merchants at food markets put ther fingers to their lips and blow imaginary dust from their nails. `` It's gone with the wind,'' said one trader, sitting on a bag of rice in his converted ship container which he uses as a store. It could not be immediately determined which rebel group was carrying out the attacks on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> road, which primarily is the domain of mujahedeen commander ahmad shah masoud of the powerful jamiat-i-islami rebel group. <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> has pledged not to attack non-military traffic, but the rival hezb-i-islami group of fundamentalist <PERSON> gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> hekmatyar </PERSON> has said it wants to cut all supplies to <LOCATION> kabul </LOCATION>, forcing people to flee. Hezb guerrillas operate to a limited extent along the lower salang, close to the capital. The fighting appeared to be part of a recent increase in rebel assaults against the government. Fighting over the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> has intensified over the last month with reports of rebel gains. The guerrillas got so close to the city in late September that the government was forced to kill its own troops with Soviet-made SCUD missiles when it wiped out rebel positions, a diplomat said. The diplomat, who comes from a socialist country with good relations with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, cited a government military source for the information. Observers in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said the current military activity appeared to indicate the rebels were returning to the hit-and-run startegy they used during the decade-long Soviet military intervention. Rebel attempts to adopt conventional military tactics and take the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> earlier this year failed.

The gang members were charged in the murder of 20 people, the attempted murder of seven people, racketeering, witness intimidation, kidnapping and obstruction of justice, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday. Officials say the indictments have dealt a `` death blow'' to the notorious <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street gang, and they could put <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> behind bars for life. The <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukns </PERSON> also were charged with controlling a major part of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s drug market over the last 24 years. The indictment also charged five <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> associates with fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. `` We intend ... to bring an end to this scourge that has debilitated the city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and suburbs throughout these years,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` I expect if the prosecutions are effective, yes, it will be a death blow'' to the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> gang. The arrest of the gang members could help solve up to 50 unsolved slayings dating to the late 1960s, said <PERSON> Dot </PERSON> <PERSON> Koester </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 45, was arrested at his <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> home Friday, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 249 years in prison. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president in 1984 and 1988, have the same father, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has described their relationship as strained. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s associates face an average of 160 years in prison if convicted. The indictment charged that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> sold heroin and cocaine to a drug operation that controlled hundreds of markets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and had ties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The drug operation netted millions of dollars in profits, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also is charged with paying <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukn </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> $ 10,000 to kill business associate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aulston </PERSON> in 1985. It also alleges that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> offered $ 10,000 to kill <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' Barber in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> was killed Jan. 3, 1986. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison in connection with the murder-for-hire of a witness to the Barber killing. He is free on a $ 1.1 million bond pending an appeal. Fort was sentenced to 155 years in federal prison on a 1988 conviction for offering to commit terrorism for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Four other gang members also were convicted of conspiracy to commit terrorism and conspiracy to violate federal firearms and explosives laws. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and five associates also were charged with skimming $ 650,000 from the profits of three <ORGANIZATION> Wendy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> restaurants on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> through the management company they controlled. Seventeen of the <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukns </PERSON> and the five <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> associates charged were in custody. The remaining defendants were being sought in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police seized the <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukns </PERSON>' South Side headquarters in a morning raid Friday. Police Superintendent <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the site would be turned into a playground. `` I think it's poetic justice for a group of people that brought so much pain to our community,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The gang took on the name <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rukn </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Fort </PERSON>, its leader, became a Muslim. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukn </PERSON> is the cornerstone of the <LOCATION> Kaaba </LOCATION>, a sacred Moslem shrine in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>.

 Abortion opponents say they will have to wait until spring to have abortion restrictions considered again by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said oppoents of legalized abortion have decided not to push the legislation any more this year because the bill is one vote short of getting through the House Rules Committee. `` We really do n't want a media event on this,'' he said Friday. The decision likely postpones any action on abortion legislation in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> until the spring session. The proposal, drafted to mirror <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion restrictions upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, would have required doctors to determine the viability of any fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older before performing an abortion. It also required the presence of a second physician at the abortion of any fetus determined to be viable, and barred public employees and public facilities from involvement in the procedures.

<TEXT>
 A Bible-quoting judge sentenced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to life in prison with no parole for murdering a church caretaker. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who had eluded hundreds of police officers in the longest manhunt in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> history, showed no emotion as Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> pronounced the sentence Friday. A jury convicted <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on July 29 of murdering <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> inside a church in nearby <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> in central <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on April 1, 1987. `` Two different individuals were taking refuge in that church for different reasons,'' the judge said, adding a quote from the Book of <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> in the Bible: `` As if a man were to flee from a lion and be met by a bear.'' `` Do you understand that?'' Long asked. After appearing bewildered for a moment, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> slowly nodded his head and said, `` Yes sir.'' The victim, a retired soldier, was preparing the church for evening services when he was shot. The judge, no relation to the victim, said the case lacked the necessary aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty. County Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said he was not disappointed with the life sentence. `` Our primary objective was conviction through a fair trial, and that's what Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> received,'' he said. About 45 spectators attended the sentencing, including <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s father, grandmother and sister They did not act surprised by the verdict. `` I figured they'd do this,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, 82. `` But I still do n't think they truthfully proved he killed that man.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s court-appointed attorney, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, made an impassioned plea to jurors to spare <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s life for the sake of his sickly father and elderly grandmother. He praised the judge's decision. `` I think he did a lot of soul searching and I think that he did what was right for him,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. `` I think the punishment fits the crime.'' But <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said he would file an appeal within 10 days. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had frustrated police for weeks by hiding out in the <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> after the killing, inspiring songs and stories in nearby towns. He was captured on May 28, 1987, by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. A .357 - caliber Magnum revolver found on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was identified by several ballistics experts as the gun used to Long, 56, a military retiree from <LOCATION> Waynesville </LOCATION>, was preparing the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> west of <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION> when he was shot once in the head. The prosecution contended that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> shot Long and then stole the victim's car. At the time, police were hunting <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for allegedly wounding a <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION> police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had been at large since escaping in 1984 from the Ozark Correctional Center, where he was serving time for burglary and possession of explosive weapons.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and leaders of its biggest union agreed to hold contract talks for just the second time since more than 115,000 workers went on strike Oct. 4. Negotiators from the aircraft company and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> will meet separately with a mediator Sunday, and direct negotiations will be held the next day, federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said he would try to keep the two sides at the table until agreement is reached, although negotiators for both sides said Friday they would n't budge an inch from their current positions. The strike has slowed production at a time orders for commercial jetliners are piling up because of growth in air travel. The Machinists represent 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers nationwide, including 43,300 in the district lodge; 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others at scattered sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and other states. In the only other negotiating attempt during the strike, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> shuttled between the two sides for nearly four hours Oct. 18 without result. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> has ruled out any increase in the financial offer and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, has ruled out a return to work without more money. `` We have not changed our position.

On Wednesday, strikers received their first strike pay of $ 100 a week each from the union. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said two more aircraft were delivered Friday, a 737-400 to <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lingus </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and a 737-300 to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

 A woman who police originally said was a teen-age kidnap victim turned out to to be a 27-year-old with a history of mental problems, authorities said.

<HEAD>Diver Says He Has Found Wrecks of Sunken Lake Steamers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A salvage expert who discovered two 19th Century steamers at the bottom of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is battling the state for control of the wrecks. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> searched the cold waters of the lake for nearly 16 years to find the Seabird and the <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Elgin </PERSON>, a luxury steamer whose 287 passengers and their valuables sank when the boat was accidentally rammed by another vessel in 1860. `` All I want to do is see this wreck preserved,'' <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> said Friday, referrring to the <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Elgin </PERSON>. In August the 41-year-old diver and salvage company operator filed a claim in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seeking title to the two ships under federal Admiralty Law. Diving in 42-degree water, he already has removed some artifacts from the wrecks and says more should be brought to the surface for preservation. The recovered items are under control of the court until ownership is decided. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials claim the wrecks are state property and should stay at the bottom, untouched except for authorized archeological work and recreational sightseeing by divers. `` To go in and strip them of artifacts and sell them is just not palatable to the state and is not in the best interest of the state,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s office is seeking to intervene in the case on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. A 1987 federal law gives states the rights to any shipwrecks found in their territorial waters, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. The state is also citing an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law that prohibits the desecration of unregistered graves. Although <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> wo n't reveal the specific location of the wrecks, he does n't dispute that the wrecks lie in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> waters and his legal action in federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> indicates they are. The sinking of the Lady Elgin Sept. 8, 1860, somewhere off <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> suburbs ranks as one of the worst disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The death toll is listed as 287 _ most of the victims were members of a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> political group returning from an excursion to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The wooden side-wheeled steamer was rammed by the lumber schooner <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION>, which was running without lights. The Lady Elgin sank rapidly, and only a handful of passengers made it to shore in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>. In a lesser-known tragedy, the Seabird caught fire and sank April 9, 1868, killing all but one of the 100 passengers on board. Also a side-wheeled steamer, the Seabird was making its first run of the season to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after wintering in <ORGANIZATION> Manitowoc </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> said he has found no remains on either wreck and cited newspaper and other historical accounts that all the bodies were recovered soon after the sinkings <PERSON> Zych </PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he first started looking for the <ORGANIZATION> Lady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elgin </ORGANIZATION> in 1973, and found it in May using sonar. He found the Seabird in 1988.

<HEAD>Police Find Europe's Top Cocaine Lab, Seize 440 Pounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police have uncovered what they believe to be the largest cocaine processing laboratory in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and seized 440 pounds of the drug hidden inside woolen blankets, police said today. Six people, all natives of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, were arrested. The spokesman said the laboratory was located in an industrial warehouse in <LOCATION> Mejorada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of the capital. The facility was raided late Friday, he said on condition of anonymity. The operation came only two days after top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Spanish, Italian and French drug enforcement officials met in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> with representatives of Latin American cocaine-producing and consuming nations. In the raid, narcotics agents captured 300 Indian-style `` ponchos,'' or blankets, impregnated with the cocaine, which had a street value of about $ 8 million, the spokesman said. Police surprised two men as they began a chemical process to remove the cocaine from the blankets, the spokesman said. Police also seized at least 260 gallons of ether, a chemical used to transform coca leaf paste into cocaine, as well as other chemicals, he said. Also today, police seized 240 pounds of heroin, the largest-ever single haul in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, in a car parked in the garage of a home in southern <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> province. Two Turkish men and a British woman were previously arrested in connection with the heroin in <LOCATION> Nerja </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION>, police said. Spanish and international drug enforcement agencies have said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was being used as a gateway into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> _ mainly Colombian _ drug traffickers. But recently, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solans </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s National Plan on Drugs coordination agency, said increased police and customs efforts had led traffickers to move shipments into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The larger cocaine seizures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this year have taken place in those three countries, he said. So far this year, police in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> have seized more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine. But in 1988, Spanish police seized 7,700 pounds of the drug, a sharp increase over the 2,200 pounds captured the year before. Seizures of cocaine in 1988 for all of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> totaled 14,000 pounds, according to National Plan on Drugs agency statistics.

<HEAD>Unemployment To Hit 4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's tough austerity program is putting people out of work and unemployment will double to 4 percent by the end of the year, a newspaper quoted officials as saying today. Song Xiaowu of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> told an international business forum that millions of people in rural areas _ not included in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> employment figures _ also will be without work. `` The Sword of Damocles hanging over the capitalist society is now hanging over the heads of the workers of new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted Song as saying. He said unemployment among <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s urban workforce of 135 million stood at 2 percent in February, but has increased sharply since the government suspended construction projects and took other measures to curb overheated economic growth. `` The unemployment problem has come to the forefront of our whole society,'' Song was quoted as saying. `` How to correctly identify and effectively solve the problem poses a new challenge to the theory and practice of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic development and structural reforms.'' Chinese officials have acknowledged the austerity program will put people out of work. Previously, however, they stressed that most people losing jobs are rural transients who will return to work on their farms. Song said, however, that there are 80 million surplus farmers. Township enterprises that have provided jobs for many will absorb 50 percent fewer workers this year than last. Song said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s unemployment problems are exacerbated by 20 million surplus workers in state-owned enterprises who ca n't be laid off because of the government's policy of providing jobs for all. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has made an attempt to cope with the unemployment situation by encouraging out-of-work people to set up collective and private businesses and exempting them from income tax for one year and business tax for half a year. However, they were unlikely to get many takers under the current political and economic atmosphere. Private entrepreneurs are being strongly criticized as `` exploiters'' and the government has cut off credit to smaller businesses. Meanwhile, the nation as a whole is doing little about the unemployment problem. A few cities have experimented with providing unemployment insurance, but for the most part people without work receive no benefits and get little help finding work.

The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has emphasized that those deficiencies did not contribute to the deaths in turret No. 2 of the battleship. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that while they may never know the exact cause of the explosion, the `` preponderance'' of evidence points to an act of sabotage by <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, a 24-year-old gunners mate from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, who was killed in the blast. Under the direction of one of <PERSON> Costigan </PERSON>'s subordinates, the crew of turret No. 2 prepared to fire a 2,700-pound projectile with the wrong kind of powder the day of the explosions. <PERSON> Costigan </PERSON> has said he believed the crew was engaging in authorized ordnance experiments.

 An envoy of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with officials in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> next week to discuss missing American soldiers and other humanitarian issues. Presidential envoy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a retired general, is to arrive Sunday for a two-day visit, the first by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said it had withdrawn its troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> is to hold talks on humanitarian issues including efforts to account for an estimated 1,700 American soldiers missing from the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said today. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>'s visit in August 1987 resulted in agreements to speed up work on humanitarian issues, including the resettlement of Vietnamese migrants and refugees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to visit since the Communists defeated the U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government in April 1975. `` This current mission seeks to expand and improve on the significant progress attained over the past two years,'' said the embassy spokesman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>'s team included senior State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, the head of the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisioners </ORGANIZATION> And Missing In <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The visit comes as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese specialists were halfway into their 8th joint field investigations to account for missing soldiers. One team was investigating an area in Song Be province in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, while the other team was working in <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bac </LOCATION> province in the northern region. The Vietnamese seek American diplomatic recognition to end their isolation from the non-Communist world and bring in badly needed economic assistance. They have complained about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to move in that direction after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in late September withdrew what it called its last 26,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> _ an action <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had called a prerequisite for establishing relations But <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now demands that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> work toward getting a political settlement to the war between Western-backed guerrillas and the Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. `` In the current situation we plan to steadfastly maintain our support for the diplomatic and economic isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said earlier this month. On Friday, the official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> radio said there have been `` new developments'' in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent months, and noted the visit by <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> and previous visits by prominent Americans. It noted that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> earlier this month returned three sets of remains believed to be those of missing Americans. Since March 1974 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has repatriated 394 sets of remains on 29 occasions, it said.

<TEXT>
 The sister of kidnapped <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> pleaded for his release in a letter addressed to his captors and published today, a day after his 42nd birthday. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, marked his fifth birthday in captivity. Kidnapped March 16, 1985, he is the longest-held of the 18 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Three <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers published Arabic translations of the letter from <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister. On Friday, she had addressed a separate birthday letter to her brother. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and American educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, are held by the shadowy pro-Iranian group <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, or holy war. The group has repeatedly offered to swap the two Americans for 15 Shiite Moslems held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on charges they set off a series of explosions there in December 1983 at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies and other installations. Mrs. Say, who has led a crusade to win her brother's release, pleaded with the captors for evidence that he is still alive. `` I beg you to release him. If you will not do so, give him love and birthday greetings from his family and friends. Allow him to give us the gift of a message on his birthday, either by letter or by videotape,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> wrote. The Arabic translation of the letter was published by <PERSON> An-Nida </PERSON>, an organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, by the pro-Syrian daily <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> and by the conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar. <PERSON> An-Nida </PERSON> published a picture of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s 4-year-old daughter <PERSON> Sulome </PERSON>, born three months after his abduction. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s three television stations screened a videotape after their evening newscasts Friday showing Sulome singing `` Happy Birthday'' and her mother, <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON>, reading a message to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> while the screen filled with his picture. In addition to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are six other Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.

<HEAD>Former Ambassador Says Israel Uses Violence and Torture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> uses violence and torture to oppress Palestinians, a former <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> said in an interview published today. <PERSON> Torleiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Anda </PERSON>, 68, retired from diplomatic service last summer after having served in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since 1984. `` Little by little, I had to turn completely around in my conceptions about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its form of democracy,'' the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspaper Aftenposten quoted <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> as saying in an interview. Aftenposten said <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> would publish a book in two weeks' time entitled `` Intefadeh. Revolt Against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' in which he criticizes Israeli policy and occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` If I was asked about my main reason for having lost so much belief in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> democracy,'' <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> said, `` I would have to say it is the question of punishment forms and the judicial system. The incomprehensible and unappreciative corruption in the administration of justice has discredited itself far beyond <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders.'' <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> also said his attitude to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has changed: `` When I came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, I had a quite banal and vulgar conception of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as being a terrorist organization. But gradually I discovered that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> consists of a lot of clever and very honest people.'' He said there is no other alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the occupied territories and that the group must be dealt with in any peace negotiations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because it considers the group a terrorist organization. Since taking over power two weeks ago, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s new non-socialist government of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> has signaled it would place more critical demands on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and give stronger emphasis to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to secure and recognized borders. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Magne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondevik </PERSON> last week refused to meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives attending the annual convention of <LOCATION> Landsorganisasjonen </LOCATION>, the Confederation of Norwegian Trade Unions.

 Suspected leftist guerrillas attacked two police posts in this Andean city, killing two officers and wounding 13 other people, police said. The rebels set off a car bomb and fired machine guns at a downtown police station Friday night and threw dynamite at and fired on a nearby office of a detective unit, police said. Other explosions occurred at the same time in different parts of the city, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Police attributed the attacks to Shining Path rebels, who have initiated a wave of violence over the last few weeks in an attempt to sabotage the nationwide municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12. The attacks began as a Roman Cathlic church next door to the police station was celebrating a Mass commemorating the Lord of Miracles celebration, a traditional Peruvian religious festival held each year in October. Police told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> nine people attending the service were among the wounded, but it was n't known if they were injured by the explosion or by the subsequent gunfire. Two policemen on duty at the police station were also wounded. Two policemen were killed and two civilians were wounded in the attack on the police detectives' office a few blocks away. Police said the casualty figure was not definite. Three hours after the attack shots were still heard in different parts of the city. The Shining Path has been battling <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government since 1980, when it launched its insurgency in the mountains near <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials and civilians.

<HEAD>Hundreds Take `Peace Trains' To Protest IRA Rail Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of demonstrators from both sides of the Irish border rode `` peace trains'' between <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> today to protest the continuing <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing of the cross-border rail link. When the two trains pulled into <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s Connolly Station, they were greeted by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> playing `` Congratulations.'' The first train arrived 28 minutes late because of mechanical. The only sign of opposition was at the <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> station in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION> near the border, where followers of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, carried banners calling for British withdrawal from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The almost exclusively <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state. Rail passengers planned to distribute leaflets in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> demanding an end to the bombings of the rail line. They were then to make the 100-mile return trip to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> where a similar protest was scheduled. One of the Irish politicians on the train, Workers' Party leader <PERSON> Proinsias </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossa </PERSON>, called for the organizing committee to remain in existence and become `` a broadly based campaign for peace in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' He said the unprecedented response to the idea _ with well over 1,000 people looking for places on the trains at one stage -- showed there was a huge number of people in the north and south anxious to take a public stand for peace and against terrorism. `` The ` peace train' concept has brought together people of different political opinions from all walks of life, north and south. I am sure the vast majority would also be prepared to support a more general demand for peace and an end to the killing and destruction,'' he said. Train service between the two cities has been disrupted more than 60 times this year because of bombs and bomb hoaxes, causing a sharp drop in the number of passengers and threatening the future of the line, organizers said. `` People right across the community are making a point and the point is this _ that this railway link between north and south must be kept open. It is vital to our island,'' said Bishop <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponyz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, who saw the demonstrators off in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Bishop <PERSON> Cahal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic leader in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who joined him at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> station, added: `` This is a message the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> can not refuse to hear, because it is coming from working and middle class people, young and old, who are not going to allow communication in this island to be stopped.'' Dr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McGimpsey </PERSON>, secretary of the organizers and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said hundreds of people had to be turned away because the trains were full. Seats were free but tickets were needed. `` All we are doing is making a peaceful point,'' he said. `` We just want the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to stop blowing up the line.''

 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Zenko </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> will not run for re-election to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, an aide said today, making him the third ex-premier planning to clear the way for younger leaders in the troubled governing party. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, prime minister for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> between 1980 and 1982, said he would retire from politics when his term expires next summer, said <PERSON> Kazuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiraga </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s election committee in <LOCATION> Morioka </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, 78, will make an official announcement at a news conference after the election committee's regular meeting Sunday, <PERSON> Hiraga </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` To us, -LRB- Mr. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s -RRB- decision came out of the blue,'' <PERSON> Hiraga </PERSON> said. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, 71, and <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, 84, said they also will not run again and will leave their seats in the powerful lower house of Parliament next summer. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting network he believes the two `` decided to resign as a younger generation of politicians has become active and it's time for senior people to retire. `` I strongly feel a big wave of change coming with the new generation,'' said <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, whose party has been dogged by a series of sex and influence-peddling scandals for more than a year. <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> he was surprised by <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s decision and said he hoped <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> would remain active in politics even though he would not be in office <PERSON> Hiraga </PERSON> said reactions from <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s local election committee were varied. `` Some say it's disappointing to see Mr. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> leave, while others say it's about time.'' The Cabinet of Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third premier this year, was only a few months ago considered a transitional government to smooth over the rocky political fortunes of the Liberal Democrats. Recent opinion polls show <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who at 58 is considerably more youthful than most party leaders, gaining in popularity among voters, partially due to his planned revisions of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> became prime minister in July 1980, after the sudden death of Prime Minister <PERSON> Masayohi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohira </PERSON>. He resigned in November 1982 after a series of unpopular political moves, including a decision to freeze a pay raise for the country's 500,000 public servants. <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> left office in 1978 and <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> in 1974. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s exit was prompted, though not forced, by a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> payoff scandal, while <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> was suffering a drop in popularity due to economic recession.

 Rescuers recovered five bodies overnight from the fire-swept debris of the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plastics plant, a spokesman said today. Twelve bodies have been found and removed, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and the search is continuing for 10 other missing employees presumed dead in Monday's blast, which leveled the plant and injured 124 people. Crews have been focusing on removing rubble from the plant's fire-gutted control room `` That's where we anticipate hoping to find a majority of the people who are unaccounted for,'' said another <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kremer </PERSON>. Much of the control room, where two bodies were found Thursday, remains buried beneath tons of debris that fell from a caved-in polyethylene finishing building. `` It is just amazing to see the amount of debris workers are having to dig through,'' said <PERSON> Kremer </PERSON>. `` But we are continuing to work around the clock to find all the unaccounted for employees. And we will continue to work around the clock until we account for all our employees and contract employees.'' The company believes flammable hydrocarbon vapor from ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor, triggering the series of explosions that rocked the plant. But <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials have said they do n't know how the gases were ignited. The plant accounts for nearly 20 percent of the nation's production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of milk jugs and grocery bags A memorial service is planned Monday for the 22 dead and missing workers, organized by <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the city and the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> and Atomic Workers Local 4-227.

<TEXT>
 Organizers say threats of an attack by white extremists will not stop Sunday's rally for freed leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The rally will go ahead `` despite threats from the faceless right-wingers,'' said <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON>, a union leader who is one of the main organizers. `` We appeal to our people to conduct themselves in a highly disciplined fashion to avoid any form of provocation.'' Elsewhere Saturday, several hundred blacks staged an anti-government march in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and about 30 black and mixed-race teachers and students read for two hours in a `` whites-only'' public library in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. But two planned protest marches in other towns failed to materialize after magistrates banned them and police cordoned off assembly points. Police officials have confirmed they were aware of anonymous threats by right-wing whites to shoot at blacks during the rally Sunday in hopes of provoking a bloodbath. The officials said steps would be taken to prevent any attack. Organizers hope to draw at least 80,000 people to the rally at a soccer stadium between <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> for what could be the largest anti-government gathering ever in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. There are plans to use about 300 buses to bring supporters of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the rally from communities across the country. Organizers said no spectators will be allowed on the playing field of the stadium. Seven hundred security marshals recruited from anti-apartheid organizations are to screen people as they pass through entrance gates to the stands. Seven of the eight men to be honored were freed unconditionally on Oct. 15 and the other was released in November 1987. Six were sentenced to life imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' best-known leader, who remains jailed. The keynote speech, expected to outline the main components of current <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> policy, is to be given by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>. He is a close colleague of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s and was the congress' general secretary when arrested in 1963 The organization has been outlawed since 1960, a year before it began a sabotage and bombing campaign against the white minority government. It is illegal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to promote the aims of the organization, but government officials have indicated that police will not interfere with the rally unless disturbances occur. Since mid-September, the government has allowed numerous protest marches nationwide, organized by trade unions and other anti-apartheid groups. However, a magistrate banned a protest march which black trade unions had planned for Saturday in <LOCATION> Vereeniging </LOCATION>, an industrial city south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Small groups of workers assembled at various points in the city, and there were unconfirmed reports that eight were arrested, but the march did not materialize.

 A killer whale appears to have flipped for a Norwegian ferry, enchanting passengers and most of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> as it tries to court the lumbering vessel. For 10 days, the 13-foot-long killer whale has hugged the side of the Voksa, a 150-foot car and passenger ferry, on its glamourless route to island villages that freckle the west coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Norwegian newspapers widely reported the black-and-white sea mammal's infatuation with the black-and-white ferry. Although the whale has been making all the advances, a <LOCATION> Voksa </LOCATION> crewman said, `` It's hard to say who fell in love with whom.'' The crew claims the whale enjoys showing off for people. They named it <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, despite questions of its gender. <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Nystoeyl </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Voksa </PERSON>'s 35-year-old captain, said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> probably lost her flock, seen in the area about a month ago. `` There must be some vibration from the ship's hull that she finds comforting,'' he said. Sea mammal expert Karl Inne Ugland of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> said the whale is lonely and wants company because it has a strong flock instinct. He said it is probably a young female, about 7 years old. Killer whales, actually large dolphins, are intelligent and <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> knows she is being watched by people aboard the ferry, <ORGANIZATION> Ugland </ORGANIZATION> said. In port, the whale gently bumps and rubs herself against the <PERSON> Voksa </PERSON>'s cold steel hull. She rolls over lazily to allow streams of water pumped from the ship's side to shower her white belly. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> lolls in the bubbly backwash of the ship's propellers, waiting up to half an hour for it to load passengers and cars. The whale peers up at downturned faces, showing her teeth, which causes many passengers to smile back. The unlikely pair has drawn crowds at each of the four stops on the ferry's 12-mile-long route in the beautiful and remote fiord south of the town of <LOCATION> Aalesund </LOCATION>. `` She's really putting on a show for you today,'' crewman <PERSON> Bjoernar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kjellsvik </PERSON> told a reporter. Passengers endured icy wind to spend hours leaning over the ship's side, watching the antics. Some drove eight or nine hours on treacherous mountain roads to see <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>. Teachers suspended classes so schoolchildren could ride the ferry. `` She's like the ferry's guardian angel. When she is around nothing bad could happen to the Voksa,'' said passenger <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ristesund </PERSON>. The whale dives deep under the white foam of <PERSON> Voksa </PERSON>'s wake as it clips along at 14 mph, then erupts inches from the boat, splashing delighted passengers. She has logged about 745 miles a week at <ORGANIZATION> Voksa </ORGANIZATION>'s side, <PERSON> Nystoeyl </PERSON> said. The killer whale and the boat had to adjust to each other. At first, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> was wary of shallow harbors and disrupted the Voksa's timetable `` The first few days we were delayed because we were afraid to hit her and because so many people came to see her,'' said <PERSON> Nystoeyl </PERSON>. The worst thing about the whale is getting people to pay for their tickets, said <PERSON> Kjellsvik </PERSON>. `` I have to shout at people to get their attention because they are all leaning over the railing to watch her,'' said <PERSON> Kjellsvik </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> snubs handouts. She has refused fish offered by the crew and is believed to hunt while the ship is docked at night. During a break, the Voksa captain tried to give the whale a backrub with a stiff broom. The whale kept its distance but <PERSON> Nystoeyl </PERSON> said, `` She'll get used to it.'' The crew worries that <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> might grow bored with the ferry and jilt the boat for a flock of real killer whales. `` The first question every crewman asks when they come aboard is ` Have you seen her today?''' said machinist <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestnes </PERSON>. Mammal expert <ORGANIZATION> Ugland </ORGANIZATION> said the whale will probably leave the fiord this winter. `` If she's still there in April, she'll probably stick with the boat for a long time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Czechs striving for democracy may look to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a force for change, but in the twisting alleys and elegant squares of old <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the name `` <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'' still rings clear. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, philosopher, dreamer, politician, orator and `` liberator'' of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1918, symbolizes Czech yearnings for democracy. He was instrumental in forming the republic in 1918. It existed for 20 years as an independent country until the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact opened the way for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to take over. His son, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, was the radio voice of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> during the dark days of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> rule. He had become the Czechoslovak foreign minister when the Communists seized power in 1948 and died a few days after the takeover in a mysterious fall from the window of his apartment in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The names of the father, who died in 1937, and the son have a mystical pull on Czechoslovaks. The Masaryks, decades after their deaths, also are a problem for the Communists In `` the lies and half-truths that surround us ... it is necessary to recall <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, who as a politician embodied an unambiguously moral standpoint,'' an unofficial youth group, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, noted recently in a typical show of popular respect. During <PERSON> Maxaryk </PERSON>'s presidency from 1918 to 1935, the youths declared, `` Czechoslovak society was free to use democratic institutions as never before and never since.'' Despite decades of Communist schooling that paid little or no heed to the <LOCATION> Masaryks </LOCATION>, most Czechs revere <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> as a leader of impeccable morals, education and eloquence. By contrast, they laughed in ridicule recently listening to black-market tapes of current <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> speaking incoherently to fellow comrades. In the heady `` Prague Spring'' of 1968, the Masaryks were honored as a source of inspiration for the democratic reforms then sweeping the country. Demanding an investigation into <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>'s mysterious death, thousands of students made pilgrimages to <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION>, a village 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and the family graves. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> maintained a country residence in <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION> that is now occupied by President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. In the village cemetery, <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, his American wife <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, and Jan lie buried beneath a simple slab of polished granite. During the `` Prague Spring,'' there was a revival of official interest in <LOCATION> Masaryk </LOCATION> and minor officials paid tribute at the <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION> grave. With reform again in the air 20 years later, low-ranking officials have returned to the <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION> cemetery. In hurried ceremonies last year and this, they laid wreaths on <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'s to mark the Oct. 28 anniversary of the proclamation of the republic and again designated the day a public holiday. The low rank of the officials and the brevity of the ceremonies testified to the Communists' continuing unease about <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>. Aware of the standing of `` Taticek,'' or `` daddy,'' as <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> is popularly known, the government is beginning to accord him a role in the official version of national history. `` <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> was undoubtedly the most important politician we ever had,'' said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harma </PERSON>, a leading official historian. `` Today, we are trying to rectify the deformed picture put in the minds of our people in the 1950s or later than that.'' `` But,'' he added swiftly, `` in this process, we do n't want to go to the other extreme and create another <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> myth.'' Official praise in state-run media and school textbooks is still tentative. But at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> there is an annual outpouring of respect for <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>. Each Oct. 28, hundreds of Czechs, many of them elderly, gather around a plaque to <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>. Anthems are sung, poems recited and heads bowed in memory of <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, a staunch friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Two regulars at the ritual are <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'s only surviving relatives in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, his granddaughters <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Herberta </LOCATION>. They are also among the leading lights of an unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Masaryk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> that counts prominent dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> among its supporters. Despite their tribulations in the Stalinist 1950s because of their name, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masarykovna </PERSON>, now in their late 70s, preserve the fondest memories of `` Taticek'' and of the affluent 1930s when <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> was a center of civilization for all <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. More robust than the English dowagers they resemble in bearing and fondness for gardening, tea, biscuits and homemade jam, they reminisce in <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>'s apartment, a mini-Masaryk museum at the top of one of the innumerable twisting staircases of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s magical <LOCATION> Mala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strana </LOCATION> district. `` Of course, he does play a role and his standing is better and better every day,'' <PERSON> Herberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masarykova </PERSON> says of her grandfather. `` But it's difficult to say what people know.'' `` Terribly little,'' adds her sister.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is called king in <LOCATION> Manda </LOCATION>, the lonely north <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> domain he inherited from his father. But <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has his sights on a larger kingdom. The 58-year-old politician has emerged as Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s main challenger in next month's general election and as the rallying point of hopes to replace the government that has dominated <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for most of its 42 years of independence. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is attempting to galvanize a coalition of opposition parties that span the ideological spectrum, from Communists to right-wing ethnic parties, to oust the man he once called his friend. But the groups, collectively known as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, are plagued by highly publicized feuds and have little in common except their opposition to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A month ago a unified opposition seemed possible as <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> activists joined ardent Communists in mass demonstrations against the government. But recent outbreaks of Hindu-Moslem violence around <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have led the Communists and some centrists to question the viability of a broad opposition alliance. It is hard to predict how, if at all, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s social, economic and foreign policies would change if power switched from a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to an opposition government in voting Nov. 22, 24 and 26. The National Front's platform, apart from accusing the <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> government of tolerating corruption, makes no radical departures from the goals outlined by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> governments. Both sides speak of easing poverty and strife in this ethnically and linguistically diverse country of 880 million people. Except for accusing the government of corruption, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has voiced few opinions. Political analysts say <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> changes his ideological color so often and with such deftness that it has become almost impossible to put him in a definite category. He has been nicknamed the `` Mr. Clean'' of Indian politics. But he also has been called a fraud and villified by numerous people, including former allies in the top ranks of the government. `` V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is a cobra. He was fed on the milk of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and now he is injecting poison into the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Kalpnath </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON>. `` He should be hanged for treachery.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a balding, bespectacled man with a Charlie Chaplin-like mustache, is aware of the importance of image but opposes personality politics. `` I have always taken the stand that we have to shift from personal appeal to issues,'' he said. `` This is the way a democracy matures and it's the issues which are agitating the peoples' minds. `` The biggest issue is the feeling that the people have been tremendously let down by the present regime and there is rampant corruption at the top,'' he said. When <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was 5, his biological father, the Rajah -LRB- king -RRB- of <PERSON> Daiya </PERSON> gave him to the Rajah of <LOCATION> Manda </LOCATION>, who was childless. He grew up in one of the most palatial outposts in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state and was the sole heir to the estate when his adoptive father died six years later. Not allowed to see real family for years, the shy young <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> turned to poetry and painting. Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> outlawed royal titles in the early 1970s, but people in <LOCATION> Manda </LOCATION> still call Singh the rajah. While in college, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> became interested in politics and eventually joined the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In 1974, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> named him a deputy minister of commerce and two years later promoted him to minister of state for commerce. He served there until Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was ousted in the 1977 parliamentary election that installed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s only non-Congress government since the country gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. When she was brought back to power after the opposition government disintegrated in 1979, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was inducted into her Cabinet as commerce minister. After Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination in 1984, her son succeeded her and picked <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as one of the `` whiz kids'' who would lead the world's most populous democracy into the 21st century. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> became a champion of political morality, a campaign for which he was sacked as finance minister and defense minister and then expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> two years later. Although he made a great show of renouncing political office, he was embraced by the opposition, former <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who bitterly opposed Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and later her son. Today, the opposition, at least for the moment, has accepted <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as its leader. His protestions about shunning positions of power have been set aside. The opposition's battle cry has been a controversial Indian government contract to buy $ 1.4 billion worth of artillery from the Swedish arms manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>. Indian newspapers have alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid middlemen up to $ 50 million in kickbacks to secure the 1986 contract. The deal was negotiated by the prime ministers of the two countries and was supposed to be free of commissions and agents' fees No one has been charged with any crime, but the scandal has tarnished <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s image. Many statements issued by the government in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have been proved wrong by documents uncovered by The Hindu and other newspapers. The scandal, which has faded and flared intermittently, was propelled back to the front pages recently, spurring <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to call elections nearly two months before the Jan. 14, 1990 deadline. Most analysts say the average Indian voter has been numbed by charges of high-level corruption and is more concerned about unemployment and rising prices. `` I am not saying that corruption is a new thing or that there was no corruption before <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s time,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` Big money always has been close to politics. `` But there was a difference. The moneybags might have funded politics, but they could not influence decisions. Politicians were like charioteers and big money was the horse pulling the chariot. Now <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has become the horse and big business has climbed into the charioteer's seat.''

<HEAD>Iraq Says Iran Attacked Iraqi Tug, Killing Crewman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After more than a year of relative peace, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Saturday accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of attacking one of its tugboats in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and killing a crewman. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied it. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> reported the incident Thursday and also said an Iraqi was killed. It was the first report of a naval incident between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since a cease-fire in their war took effect Aug. 20, 1988. There have been only minor reports of cease-fire violations on land. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the report was contained in a protest letter that its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative gave to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The letter said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be held responsible for the results of the attack, <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said in the past that any shot fired on an Iraqi vessel would be considered a serious violation of the cease-fire, which ended eight years of war between the neighboring countries. In its letter to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said two Iranian gunboats attacked the tugboat Al-Intisar on Wednesday morning close to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> offshore oil terminal of <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Bakr </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted navy commander Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> as saying: `` Iranian forces have not been engaged in any encounter in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.'' `` It is possible that the clash took place between two foreign forces stationed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and that the foreign media have wrongly taken one of them as the Iranians,'' he said in the report also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON>'s comments came before <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> made its public accusation. Iranian reports at the time of the reported incident said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was conducting naval maneuvers in the gulf but did not specify where. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that two Iranian gunboats fired at the tug. It said an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> was killed in the incident, which it said took place Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from the port of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Secrets Locked in Computers Difficult to Dislodge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are struggling to write new rules governing citizen access to government information, amid growing fear that the computer is becoming an engine for official secrecy. Current practices could turn ordinary citizens and volunteer organizations into `` information peasants'' while well-financed government, business, science and media interests become `` lords of the information age,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>. A survey <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> conducted of nearly 300 research and lobbying groups concludes that `` they were better off in locating and obtaining federal public information in the 1970s'' than they are now. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is conducting the first survey of how federal agencies release electronic data to citizens under the Freedom of Information Act. Preliminary analysis shows that agencies adopt a more restrictive rather than a more open view of their obligations by a 3-1 margin. This situation has emerged after a decade in which federal computer use has exploded. The government owned a few thousand microcomputers in 1980; next year, its inventory should reach 1 million. With limited public awareness that the problem even exists, lobbyists, officials and legislators in this city have been advancing rapidly toward far-reaching decisions. Negotiations are under way to revise a bill submitted last May by Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> government information If enacted, the bill would present the first declaration by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that government has an affirmative obligation to distribute its electronic information to citizens in a form they can use and at a price they can pay. If warring interest groups can agree on issues like how much power to give the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the bill might reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor as early as January. Without warning last June, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to reverse a much-criticized policy it had issued during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1985. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy, still in effect as <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circular </ORGANIZATION> A-130, forbids federal agencies from developing any electronic information system that duplicates those available in the private sector and requires them to rely on private industry to disseminate government information. In June, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said it was ready to adopt many of the principles of Wise's bill, including encouragement of a diversity of private and government distribution systems. So shocked was one watchdog group, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Watch, that its newsletter headlined the story: `` Hunger Ends, World Declares Peace, and <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Announces Reform Movement.'' At the end of November, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Privacy </ORGANIZATION> will gather all the government's <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> officers to try to develop uniform policy on a range of issues, such as whether citizens can obtain the software or programming used by the government to analyze data on its computers. Down the road are other issues, some of which have already generated lawsuits, like one over whether citizens can use the Freedom of Information Act to read the electronic mail that officials send to each other's desktop computers. Last week about 70 of the interested parties _ Justice and <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials, legislators and their staff, public interest and information industry lobbyists and lawyers, librarians and academic researchers _ were brought together for a two-day conference by the <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bauman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Their discussions made clear that those seeking electronic data from the government face serious obstacles in the way federal agencies interpret the Freedom of Information Act. A number of problems have involved a provision that agencies need not create a new record to respond to requests. The phrase `` create a record'' was drafted when nearly all government information was on paper. Computer specialists say it has little meaning in describing how to extract information from a computer. <PERSON> Quin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> group that collects government documents for researchers and news reporters, cited a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Asked in an FOIA request for a list of limited-access technical reports, it said no such list existed _ even though all the titles were compiled in a computer. The agency argued that its computer program matched names of eligible requesters with titles they were allowed to see, but that asking for a complete list would amount to creating a new record. The department's appeals office eventually overruled that decision, but only after several exchanges with the archive, which has proven its willingness to go to court and has the expertise of <LOCATION> Shea </LOCATION>, a former top Freedom of Information official at Justice. <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, argued that no new legislation is needed, because courts have so far been applying the Freedom of Information Act to electronic data. `` The rush to amend the act is premature,'' she said. But the conference organizer, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s information technology project, argued that courts `` took 40 years to figure out that wiretapping violates the Constitution. And there's no guarantee all the rulings will come out right.'' Further, he argued that court cases could pit impoverished public interest groups against well-financed private interests. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION>, told the group, `` I'm very hesitant to open up FOIA again unless there is a consensus'' among the various interests at the conference He said some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still would like to gut the original Freedom of Information Act. Former <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON> argued that such a consensus should form around legislation to extend citizen access to electronic records. Noting that in this Congress three agencies have sought exemptions from the existing act, <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON> said, `` If the only proposals are on the bad side, then only bad things will get passed.'' But the Wise bill is showing that federal information users agree more easily on problems than solutions. Conference participants agreed on the need for standardized computer formats and a list of government databases. But those provisions have been dropped from Wise's bill, because the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and some other groups worried they would entrust too much power to the Office of Management and Budget.

The Tigrean rebels, who describe their ongoing offensive as a pre-emptive strike against mobilizing government forces, announced their agreement in a telex to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> office. `` The <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> has always stood for peace and a peaceful solution,'' the message said. `` This agreement to hold talks is a clear proof of its principled and firm stand on peace.'' The rebel group pushed the government out of <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province in February, and there was a lull in fighting until August, when the rebels pushed south into neighboring <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> province. Last week, the insurgents claimed to have captured the town of <LOCATION> Mekane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Selam </LOCATION>, 100 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. That would mark their deepest penetration toward the capital in their 15-year-old war to overthrow the government of President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>. The government also is scheduled to resume peace talks with another major rebel movement, the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> next month. Those talks began in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, in September, withformer President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as an observer. The Eritrean rebels have been fighting a war of secession for 28 years in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost province. The two rebel forces have in the past combined efforts on the battlefield.

 About 200 Soviets will be in town this week to sample capitalism at the local mall, mingle with Americans in their homes and grapple with issues such as arms control at an international conference. All but about 50 of the Soviets will stay with families for a week as they attend the Fifth General Chautauqua Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations, which features public sessions designed to encourage a candid exchange between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet citizens. `` These are not closed door think tanks,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chautauqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, which is co-sponsoring the conference with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` They permit a wide cut of our citizenry to engage with policy makers from both countries.'' American talk show host <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> will team up with Soviet radio and television commentator <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozner </PERSON> for a `` Citizens Open Dialogue'' program Monday night. Former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Marlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> will speak on women's issues at the conference, which runs from Sunday through Friday. Other sessions will focus on cooperation in space, problems with youth, trade, religion and human rights. Headsets will be available so the audience can listen to simultaneous translations. `` This is an attempt to try and understand each other,'' said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a conference organizer. `` Culturally, we're different. Historically, we're different. Socially, we're different It's very important to find common ground.'' The Soviet visitors range from scientists to sanitation workers. `` Many of them are going to be here for the first time,'' <PERSON> Romanov </PERSON> said. `` It will be a great opportunity to live with an American family and discuss whatever they wish.'' Some of the host families plan to take their visitors to the schools their children attend or to work, said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION>. `` One family is talking about taking them to their neighborhood pumpkin-carving festival,'' she said. `` A lot of them are talking about taking them to video stores and letting them pick out movies.'' The Soviets will have the chance to tour the pantry of a food bank, talk to counselors at a drug rehabilitation clinic and shop at a suburban supermarket and upscale mall. `` Our aim is to give them a complete view of American life,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Posvar </PERSON>. A high school band will greet the visitors when they arrive for lunch, a fashion show and a two-hour shopping spree at <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION>, said mall spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvison </PERSON>. `` I think you're going to see some very heavy shopping. We understand denim is very hot in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We let our stores that carry jeans know they might be very busy,'' <PERSON> Harvison </PERSON> said. `` We're providing merchants with the Russian translations of things like ` May I help you?' and ` Thank you.' They'll have to wing it from there,'' she said. A classical music performance will feature the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theatre </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theatre </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION> along with Soviet musicians and dancers.

<TEXT>
 Boosters of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> have told tales of woe for four decades, but deterioration of the `` river of grass'' now may have reached a point of no return, says a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist. Watching the park since 1965, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> has seen rookeries with 10,000 to 20,000 birds disappear and witnessed a general decline in what was once an abundant wildlife sanctuary. `` We're just sticking our thumbs in the levee right now,'' he said last week at a conference that drew 40 Everglades scientists and their latest research. `` I think most people agree we have come to a now-or-never stage.'' The litany of problems seems to grow longer with each new study. Human intervention in the form of urban development, farming, drainage, flood control, firefighting and the introduction of hardy exotic plants has cut the size of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> in half from an estimated 2.5 million acres in 1900, erased 12 native species and stressed what remains. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther and wading birds were subjected to the most intense study, and, as in past years, the news is bad. Only a handful of endangered <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panthers, a close relative of the cougar, remains in <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, but a new study shows that the dwindling habitat may be able to support only eight to 10 cats _ apparently too low to make the species biologically viable. Water policies favoring farmers and urban dwellers have forced wading birds to relocate their colonies and cut the population in the southern <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> from 300,000 to 15,000. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the governor's office told the 6th <ORGANIZATION> Everglades </ORGANIZATION> symposium that $ 163 million has been spent by the state since then-Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> declared the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> a top priority in 1983. `` Progress is steady, but it's slow and we all need to recognize that,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The spending `` is no small amount of money, but it's probably not enough.'' Federal and state agencies have obtained more than 275,000 acres in recent years as a buffer zone for the park and are restoring some of the free-flowing channels that have been lost since the 1940s in the shallow inland wetlands. `` There is virtually none of this system left the way it was,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, wetlands research coordinator with the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. The district mandates water policy for the region but is being sued by the federal government for delivering polluted water to the park. `` Virtually every square mile of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> is not what it was in 1900,'' he said, picking the time before settlers made their mark. Solutions revolve around park expansion southwest of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, water delivery to approach the historic natural flow and delivery of cleaner water, possibly by buying land north of the park to act as kidneys filtering out unwanted phosphorus and nitrogen. The Everglades is a 1.2-million-acre expanse of marsh grasses, hardwood stands and pine islands, but only about one-third is within park boundaries on the southern tip of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula.

<TEXT>
 The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claim to have seized a strategic stretch of highway leading to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, after driving back forces of the Vietnamese-backed government `` The Vietnamese enemy and puppets have been routed from Route 10,'' said a report Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The text of the report was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` Their major divisions and regiments have fled to <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> and to the east. No one is defending Route 10.'' Route 10 links the gem-rich town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, to <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, about 40 miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 22 captured <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> and said they were pushing northeast to <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, a provincial capital. Claims by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are widely regarded as exaggerated, but <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials have confirmed the seizure of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. In the past, the Cambodian government media quickly countered <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claims, but they have not commented on <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. Government radio on Friday claimed one division `` strengthened its foothold'' and recently beat back guerrilla infiltrators, killing 30 of them. <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> is about 50 miles east of the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border and 160 miles northwest of the capital, <LOCATION> Pnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The capture of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> would be the biggest guerrilla victory of the 11-year-old war. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the largest member of the three-party guerrilla coalition fighting the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after invading in 1978 to topple a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government. During the three years the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled the country, hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from executions, famine and civil unrest. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims it withdrew its last troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in September, but the guerrillas say it has left behind thousands of soldiers disguised in Cambodian government units. The two non-Communist guerrilla groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the forces of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, have made significant advances north of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> since the Vietnamese pullout The Sihanouk forces are advancing on <LOCATION> Samrong </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oddar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meanchey </LOCATION> province while the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> is heading toward <LOCATION> Svey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION>, the only big town blocking their advance to the military center of <LOCATION> Sisophon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, not one to take public positions on politics or politicians, spoke through his music. With the help of his son and his orchestra, <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s melodic voice will be heard again. The platform is a benefit Sunday for the <ORGANIZATION> Schomburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Black Culture, the culmination of a year-long celebration of <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s 90th birthday April 29. <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, granddaughters <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, the choreographer, and <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, pianist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and tap dancer <PERSON> Honi </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> were among those scheduled to join the tribute at the Shubert Theater. `` I feel that people did n't realize how much of a message he left in his works. We're going to put it right in front of them and tell it like it is,'' said <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, 70. `` The only way you got to know <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> was not to know him but to know his music.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> died in 1974 after casting his `` Black, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and Beige'' spell upon the globe for nearly 50 years. His output _ much of it scratched onto napkins, envelopes and scraps of paper tucked in his pockets _ added much to the books of opera, Broadway, church music, film scoring and, of course, jazz. `` Take the A Train'' -LRB- by his collaborator and alter ego <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Strayhorn </PERSON> -RRB-, `` Satin Doll,'' `` A Drum is a Woman,'' `` Mood Indigo,'' `` Sophisticated Ladies,'' `` It Do n't Mean a Thing if it Ai n't Got that Swing'' and `` In the Beginning God'' are just a few Ellington standards. `` I think he's one of the world's great composers,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a Ph.D. in education who is <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> professor of music at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> and a fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` His music reflects the sophistication, the earthiness and the many other qualities we know about ourselves.'' Ellington's music was a reflection of the man himself, a man who supported the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and other causes but did not say so publicly, said <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>. `` Talking to <LOCATION> Ellington </LOCATION> many times was like talking to your psychiatrist. He would let you talk on the couch and cure yourself,'' his son said. `` He was a very hard man to pin down. But he did make absolute statements.'' The song `` Money Jungle,'' for example, meant that money was `` eternal grief. Whether you had money or did n't have money, it was always trouble,'' the younger <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> said. `` All during the way, he had money problems. He supported a large family. ... The song shows the turbulence that was gnawing away at him underneath.'' `` The Three Black Kings'' of another piece were actually the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> and one of the kings who found Christ in the manger. `` Take the A Train'' was <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s paean to black imagination. `` Much of what he represented and believed in was <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, that this was the one -LRB- subway -RRB- stop that was the greatest. <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> really meant black creativity,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> said. `` Jazz is like baseball in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the basic source for it was the black community.'' <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, whose late husband <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> was <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s good friend and physician, recalled how Ellington, <PERSON> Strayhorn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> got caught in a hotel during a coup in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in 1963. While planes bombed the palace near their hotel, `` <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strayhorn </PERSON> were on the roof taking pictures,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> was under the bed writing music.''

<TEXT>
 More than 10,000 people defied Communist authorities today and marched in the steets to mark the 71st anniversary of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and riot squads swinging batons moved in to break up the rally. Thousands of people converged on <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s central Wenceslas Square at 3 p.m., when independent groups had asked them to show up in a peaceful display of the popular desire for more freedom. Cheers went up when banners saying: `` The truth will prevail,'' and `` We will not let the republic be disrupted'' _ a popular Communist slogan turned on its head by the demonstrators _ appeared in the crowd. The crowd also chanted for <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, the philosopher who founded independent <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1918. The Czechoslovak state came into existence on Oct. 28, 1918, with the dissolution of <LOCATION> Austria-Hungary </LOCATION>. The Communists consolidated power in 1948, and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> remains one of the Soviet bloc's most rigidly controlled socialist states. Riot police appeared in side streets about 20 minutes after the demonstrations began and gradually moved in to disperse the crowd. Some people were beaten with police batons as they were led away to waiting buses dotted amid dozens of yellow-and-white riot police vans. `` We want no violence,'' hundreds of people chanted as they were penned in by riot police. `` We've got bare hands,'' they shouted raising their arms to the sky to show police they were unarmed. They also demanded free elections and a new government. About 90 minutes after the demonstration began, clapping protesters still intermittently shouted `` freedom'' as police sought to disperse them. More than 2,000 of the demonstrators eventually made their way to old town square, like <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> square a historic gathering place for Czechs. There they sang the national anthem and chanted more slogans for freedom before helmeted riot police again moved in to disperse the crowd. The crowd was estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000, marking the largest anti-government demonstration since August 1988, when 10,000 people marched for more freedom on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform in 1968. Authorities had arrested at least 11 dissidents, including <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, to prevent them attending the independent rally. But dissidents said other activists escaped the police dragnet and hoped to attend the protest. Today's march was held shortly after the Communist government celebrated the anniversary of independence with a military parade in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. About 1,500 soldiers stood at attention as Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaclavik </PERSON> instructed them to swear allegiance to their socialist homeland. In a 15-minute speech, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempny </PERSON>, head of the Communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Czech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, emphasized the importance of preserving Communist rule. He reiterated the government will not seek dialogue with opposition groups. `` There is no sense in debate with those who like to talk, but who oppose February 1948, and are against socialism, who care only for the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honest workers from their work and to create chaos,'' <PERSON> Kempny </PERSON> said. His speech drew only scant applause from an estimated 3,000 Czechoslovaks who received special cards to pass through police cordons and metal barriers for the ceremony. Most attending appeared to be relatives of the soldiers, who concluded the ceremony marching past <LOCATION> Kempny </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vaclavik </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> and other dignitaries. The officials stood on a reviewing stand draped in red cloth bearing the legend, `` We serve the socialist homeland.'' Two rocket transporters carrying two missiles apiece and two armored personnel carriers were stationed on the square. Last year, 5,000 people rallied on Oct. 28 and were dispersed by riot police using dogs, a water cannon, tear gas and batons. At least 87 people were arrested. At the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, Ambassador <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> made a veiled call for more freedom in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in a brief speech before about 250 Czechoslovaks honoring <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, who founded democratic <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> is now gradually being accorded a role in national history after being reviled for decades as a bourgeois capitalist.

<TEXT>
 Drug agents raided a cocaine laboratory, seized 440 pounds of the drug and arrested a Colombian believed to be the leader of a European narcotics distribution ring, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. In a statement, the ministry said authorities also arrested five other people in the raid on a warehouse in <LOCATION> Mejorada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. It called the laboratory the biggest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. European authorities have noted a steady rise in cocaine consumption in recent years. The operation came two days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Spanish, Italian and French drug officials met in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> with representatives of Latin American cocaine-producing nations to step up efforts to combat drug trafficking. In the raid, narcotics agents found that the drug had been worked into the fabric of alpaca wool blankets, ponchos and sweaters and packed in numerous boxes in the warehouse. Police also seized about 260 gallons of ether, a chemical used to transform coca leaf paste into cocaine, and more than 50 bottles of compounds added to the pure drug to increase its quantity for street sales. Agents surprised two men as they began the chemical process to remove the cocaine from the blankets and clothing, the ministry said. Police arrested <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the alleged leader of the organization; and Cuban-born Americans <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes-Dupont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. Others arrested were <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Caridad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriola </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayolo </PERSON>, believed to be a Colombian. No hometowns were given. Police accused <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON> of running the European distribution of the shipment. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said more arrests were Police conservatively estimated the value of the 440 pounds of cocaine at $ 8 million, but the street value could be as high as $ 80 million to $ 160 million. A ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police believed the laboratory had just been set up. In the past, Colombian cocaine traffickers have hidden cocaine in clothing to make it easier to smuggle the drug into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, mainly for later ground transport to other European countries. The investigation that led to the raid included extended surveillance of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON>, who had lived in lavish style in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> two years, the statement said. Police said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> and Reyes-Dupont had been in touch with <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> earlier this year. The two traveled to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> but returned in September, apparently after having arranged for a shipment of cocaine to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the statement said. Spanish and international drug enforcement agencies have said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is being used as a gateway into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by Latin American drug traffickers. But recently, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solans </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s National Plan on Drugs coordination agency, said increased police and customs efforts have led cocaine smugglers to turn away from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and move more shipments into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> through ports in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Colombian drug syndicates are believed to supply the vast majority of cocaine distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Colombian government in August declared war on traffickers. Drug traffickers in turn have waged an almost daily campaign of bombings and killings of officials and journalists in an effort to intimidate the government into ending its crackdown.

 Skinheads fatally stabbed an activist of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during clashes early Saturday outside the party's headquarters, police said. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> was stabbed in the chest when a group of 15 skinheads tried to disrupt a concert in the party headquarters, party member <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinho </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> died on the way to a hospital. <PERSON> Pinho </PERSON>, in an interview with <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s independent radio TSF, said the clashes began after skinheads gathered near the party building in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s seedy <LOCATION> Intendente </LOCATION> area late Friday and began shouting insults at the activists. About 20 members of the Trotskyist party tried to persuade the skinheads to leave, <PERSON> Pinho </PERSON> said. He said the activists recognized some of the skinheads as members of a neo-Nazi political group. He did not name the group.

 Black candidates whose views and resumes place them in the political mainstream are breaking new ground as they seek white support in settings as varied as <ORGANIZATION> Tidewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, the boroughs of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. Leading the way are <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, with his strong bid to make <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> the first state to elect a black governor, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who could become the first black mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A former state legislator now in his fourth year as lieutenant governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is running as a supporter of the `` fiscally conservative management'' of Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who can not succeed himself. His opponent, Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, contends <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> would take the state back `` to the days of higher taxes, high interest rates and high inflation.'' `` What was unthinkable only a couple of years ago has become inevitable,'' said pollster <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> when asked about the progress blacks were making attracting white votes. While <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> are attracting the most attention in the off-year elections to be decided Nov. 7, they are not the only candidates bidding for racial breakthroughs. This year's elections also are providing the first electoral test of the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision on abortion. Like <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is electing a governor and hundreds of cities from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, to some of the nation's smallest are choosing mayors. In most cases, incumbents seeking new terms face only token opposition. Voters in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> also are filling legislative seats, while in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> a referendum asks whether people favor stopping cruise missile tests in the state. The race to succeed Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is between two House members, Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>. While blacks seek new gains in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and to build on earlier success in cities like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, the most prominent black in national politics, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, has played a lesser role. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has stayed out of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, at <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s request. `` I think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is an activist,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> in an interview. `` I have been involved with compromises _ getting half the loaf when you could n't get the whole loaf. I do n't want to walk away empty-handed.'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, who specializes in polling for minority candidates, said the new wave of black politicians `` seem to have developed a particular way of connecting with the electorate. If you look at most of them, there is something about them that makes them more acceptable to white folks.'' `` I think we are certainly seeing a kind of different appeal on the part of black candidates,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a scholar who specializes in studying black political trends. `` We do n't hear the sort of rhetoric of ` our time has come,' instead, we hear black candidates emphasizing their resumes and also emphasizing they are the people to bring about unity,'' she said. After the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last summer that would allow states to restrict access to abortions, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> took a strong position in favor of abortion rights. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> had earlier said he would sign legislation outlawing abortion, but then asserted he would not impose his views on others. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> aides conceded that `` we have had problems'' with the issue. Recently, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> campaign has grown increasingly nasty with each candidate portraying the other in television ads as Pinocchio, his nose growing with each new untruth. Despite the savage nature of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> campaign, it has drawn less national attention than the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> contest between <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. The grandson of slaves, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> grew up during the period when <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s public facilities were racially segregated and has urged voters not to `` turn the clock back.'' Both candidates have avoided making race an overt issue in the campaign. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said Virginians see their contest `` just as two candidates running for office.'' While race is avoided as an issue, abortion has emerged as a highly charged element in the campaign, and one that appears to work in favor of <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a supporter of abortion rights. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> conceded that abortion was an issue that was hurting him and urged that it `` now should be put to rest.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> held a wide lead over Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, in early public opinion polls but the contest tightened dramatically when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate was put on the defensive by reports he had undervalued stock he sold to his son and by remarks by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a black activist who had worked in the primary campaign. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said it was wrong to call him anti-semitic, as many have charged. `` I'm anti-white,'' he said. <PERSON> Dinkin </PERSON>'s low-key style was considered an advantage when he upset flamboyant Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in the Democratic primary. The contest for mayor of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> is between two blacks and the winner is likely to be the one who attracts the most white votes. The Cleveland race has been marked by bitter personal attacks from both candidates _ City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> has called White a `` slum lord,'' while the state senator has described the council president as a `` master of sleaze.'' Another issue in the race has been allegations _ denied by the twice-divorced <PERSON> White </PERSON> _ that he beat his first two wives. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, a city councilman, is given a better chance of becoming the first black mayor, than <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> is of becoming the first Republican elected to the office in 24 years. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, black state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> overwhelmed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the Democratic mayoral primary last month, despite <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON>'s backing from the city's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> establishment and the fact the city is about 70 percent white. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> is heavily favored to defeat Republican <PERSON> Robie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pooley </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Last summer, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the first woman justice in the 200-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, gave Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> the vote he had sought for 16 years _ a working majority to begin dismantling the `` Roe'' decision written by fellow Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> in 1973. For now, business continues as usual at most of the clinics and hospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out of every 100 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women of childbearing age. Under the new ruling, more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption, because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than the point at which the states may now intercede. But with three more challenges to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> on the justices' docket, it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973 decision entirely, allowing states either to re-criminalize all abortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions, ranging from mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medical testing of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> himself wrote that the signs his decision will be explicitly overturned `` are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.'' Some saw the Missouri ruling as the grandest judicial affirmation to date of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s revolution. Others say it may prove, ironically, to unravel it. The opinion of the court's majority simply is not shared by the majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> Most polls, including a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey last summer, say that by a 2-1 margin, Americans believe abortions should be legal. But they are more evenly divided, and in some cases tilt the other way, on questions regarding public spending, parental consent and related curbs. <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, director of a women's clinic in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, puts it this way: `` Americans favor abortion only in the case of rape, incest and their own personal circumstance.'' Democratic pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> says many Republicans outside the religious right _ those in the suburban mainstream of the party _ `` have always given a wink and a nod'' to their candidates' stated abortion views. But now that the court has made abortion a hot political issue, he says, `` many will not find that acceptable anymore.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> echoed that view when he warned <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> politicians that suburban defections `` could drive a stake through the heart of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coalition.'' Republican consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, however, says the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platform last year, stands to lose its last conservative bloc, the urban, blue-collar Roman Catholics. There are no guarantees to any of these theories. Even the Catholic coalition can not be taken for granted, despite the church's vehement opposition to abortion. Indeed, <PERSON> Guttmacher </PERSON> researchers have found that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> women are more likely to have an abortion than either Protestant or Jewish women _ probably because they practice less birth control. Another somewhat startling finding: One out of every six women who have an abortion describes herself as an evangelical Christian. There will be some early clues on the political scene. Abortion is an issue in two gubernatorial races next month, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, as well as the mayoral contest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. And next year, 36 gubernatorial races as well as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a third of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be fought. The pro-choice movement, meanwhile, is back on the march _ starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300,000 people to the capital on the eve of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s hearing of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case. And it was buoyed last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s wholesale rebuke of the anti-abortion laws Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> tried to push through a special session. Moreover, for the first time this decade, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill that would have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance for abortions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed it this past week. `` Read our lips: Take our rights, lose your jobs,'' says <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. At its 20th anniversary convention, the league named nine politicians, including <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, as special targets for defeat next year. According to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, abortion is likely to become `` The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics _ a no-win issue.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> says the nation's 7,500 state legislators are `` saying ` Oh, my God,' and wondering how they can control the damage.'' The anit-abortion movement, meanwhile, is content to take things one step at a time. `` We believe the court will permit the states and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to restrict the reasons for abortions,'' says <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Overall, more than half the states are regarded as likely to enact some restrictions, another eight to 10 are battlegrounds, and 10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortion-on-demand rights. Part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such a blizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics and doctors will give up their abortion services as legally or financially risky. The anti-abortion shock troops, meanwhile, belong to `` Operation Rescue,'' a largely white, evangelical Christian group that counts 35,000 members and thousands of arrests while demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country. Typically, its `` rescues'' entail forming a human blockade around the clinic, while `` sidewalk counselors'' attempt to turn away the women trying to get through. Some protestors have entered clinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood. The group, disowned by many in the anti-abortion movement, is led by young <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who carts a disfigured, splotchy fetus he calls `` Baby Choice'' around the country in a jar of formaldehyde. At news conferences, he lays the fetus out in a tiny coffin lined with white satin. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, a former used-car salesman, will point to the fetus and declare: `` That's not a blob of cells. That's a little girl.'' Operation Rescue also distributes a video designed to evoke equal shock. It features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenes of Nazi concentration camps. A somewhat milder video, called `` the Silent Scream,'' has been circulated for years by other anti-abortion groups. Now, the pro-choice forces are distributing a video of their own. Produced by the Fund for the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, it is called `` Abortion: For Survival'' and depicts an actual abortion that lasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos, amounting to about two tablespoons of blood and tissue. The point is to demonstrate that what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearly the baby-like figure depicted by the opposition. Whatever the tactics, the abortion war looms, like the civil rights struggle and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as a long and painful one for the country. The difference is that nobody predicts an end to this fight, by law or by conscience.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said anew today that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government will break a 19-month cease-fire with U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas, but he refused to say when. `` I do n't want to abuse the hospitality of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and so the date on which the cease-fire will be suspended will be announced in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he told a news conference. The leader of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government added, however, that he would keep observing the cease-fire if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to `` take the money it gives to the counterrevolutionaries and gives it instead to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> so that it can be used to demobilize the rebels inside and outside of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had shocked a hemispheric meeting on peace and democracy Friday by saying the cease-fire could not hold because of stepped up attacks by rebel guerrillas. He made the announcement in a speech at the University of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a news conference, called it `` a shameful blow to democracy'' if <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> does end the cease-fire and renew hostilities. He called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` this little man ... in a military uniform'' and criticized <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s conduct at the hemispheric meeting on democracy. The cease-fire has been extended on a monthly basis since March 23, 1988, with the latest extension running out Oct. 31. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the fighting had never entirely ceased in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> despite the cease-fire. He said Contra attacks since March 1988 had left 736 dead and 1,153 injured, with 1,481 other people kidnapped or `` disappeared.'' `` The waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries have increased enormously in the last few weeks,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. He said thousands of Contra troops had moved back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The objective is the destruction of the electoral process in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who is running for re-election in Feb. 25 elections. `` The drop of water that made the glass spill'' was an attack that killed 19 people last Sunday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told an audience at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rica </ORGANIZATION> Friday night. `` After these savage attacks I met with the army high command to analyze the situation, and the result of the analysis was that the cease-fire could not be maintained,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> promptly condemned any end to the cease-fire as a `` step backwards'' in a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace process that has been painstakingly promoted by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> must have been `` too ashamed to bring it up'' during a three-hour meeting with 16 other hemispheric leaders here to help celebrate 100 years of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> democracy. The cease-fire went into effect shortly after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted military aid to the Contras. Scattered fighting inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continued, but at a greatly reduced scale. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> kept up non-lethal aid as about 12,000 Contra troops moved out of the jungle and into camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The fighting began to pick up again after five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> included, signed peace accords on Aug. 7. The accords called for disbandment of the Contras in exchange for democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and an agreement that all parties would stop supporting subversive movements in other countries. In a surge of optimism that followed the accords and Sandinista moves towards elections, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> and Sandinista commanders held battlefield parleys and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> suspended the draft. But Contra field leaders said they were not a party to the agreements and would not comply. They said they had been betrayed and tarred by their association with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its unsteady support. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON>, commander of the Contra army, began sending his troops back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, saying they were the only guarantee that the Sandinistas would keep their promise to hold free elections. Nicaraguan Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s brother, said Sandinista forces would not attack Contra positions but also would not allow them to move into new areas Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said ending the cease-fire `` is a serious blow to the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan, we should all understand that the solution is n't easy.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> appealed to <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> at Friday's meeting to stop shipping arms to rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made no reply. When the first Contras began marching out of their camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> at the beginning of September, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they feared that the powerful Sandinista army would be able to wipe out the isolated and outnumbered Contra groups. Sunday's attack, which took place on the last day of voter registration for Feb. 25's general election, proved `` the Contras are trying to deny the Nicaraguan people their right to an electoral process,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` We have to guarantee the safety of the Nicaraguan people and the electoral process, which means we have to organize the army better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm ourselves,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> warned that resumed fighting could be `` seized upon as a desperate effort to cancel the elections,'' the linchpin of the peace process.

 The six-month <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigation of federal housing programs yielded dramatic tales of mismanagement and favoritism but failed to reveal definitively what roles former top agency officials played and whether they engaged in criminal activity. `` We did n't crack the ring,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` We did n't nail down and expose what I think was a conspiracy to defraud the government.' The investigation by the Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing began in April after a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> report found that a rehabilitation program was being milked for millions of dollars in excess rents and that subsidies apparently had been steered to developers who hired well-connected consultants. In 24 hearings the panel was told how <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> failed to keep track of millions of dollars, mismanaged programs and gave favored treatment to those with agency or political connections. But the refusal of former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and three of his top deputies to answer questions about their roles left a gaping hole in the investigation and also effectively ended it. Only a few more hearings are expected before the investigation is closed. The question of whether there was criminal activity was left to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said Friday that investigations are ongoing. `` We have more than 700 open cases that involve up to 1,000 individuals or companies,'' he said. `` These are high priority items and will continue to be until this <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> mess is cleaned up.'' But <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> opposes congressional efforts to get him to name a special prosecutor to investigate <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Federal authorities have in recent months reviewed records compiled by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general and the subcomittee, and several grand jury investigations are known to exist. The only way for the subcommittee investigation to make significant progress would be to secure the testimony of one or more of the former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who refused to testify, members of the panel said. The only way to do that, it appears, would be to grant immunity. The panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Friday he had no current plans to offer immunity to anyone but said he had not ruled it out in the future <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> appears to lack the support on the panel he would need for such a move. `` I have no intention of playing God and trying to decide who should and who should n't be granted immunity,'' said <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said immunity was `` a very sensitive subject'' and should only be granted if approved by prosecutors One member of the panel, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said preliminary discussions with two of the former <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> aides about immunity had convinced him they would provide too little evidence to make it worthwhile. Even <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, who has appeared to relish his role in leading the televised hearings, conceded the decisions by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and others not to answer questions effectively brought the subcommittee investigation to a halt. `` The subcommittee has finished the bulk of its work,'' he said. That work included public testimony from 50 witnesses, staff interviews with scores more and occasional theatrics. With one notable exception, the former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, consultants, closing agents and attorneys called before the panel to discuss their activities said they had done nothing wrong. The exception was <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, better known as `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> HUD </PERSON>,'' who wept and read from Scripture as she told how she easily stole more than $ 5 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during her work as a closing agent on property sales and gave some of it to the needy. She said she deserved to be punished and promised to repay. Other witnesses, however, defended their HUD-related activities, which including reaping fees of up to $ 1.3 million for lobbying <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of developers. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a prominent Republican consultant, conceded his work could be called `` influence peddling'' but said he broke no laws or <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations. Former Interior Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> matter-of-factly defended his making $ 300,000 to $ 420,000 on one project alone _ for making a few phone calls to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and sitting down with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for one meeting. And <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, bragged about his ability to win <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> work for his clients and blurted out a sarcastic `` Good luck'' when told the goal of the hearings was to remove influence peddling from government. He promised to stop cashing in on his political position `` as soon as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does.''

 Police are looking for a fussy bank robber who walked up to a teller and demanded $ 418, but `` no ones.'' The teller handed over an undisclosed amount of money on Friday and the robber, who was wielding a sharp object, fled on foot. `` I do n't know how he figured unless he expected change,'' said Cpl. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McCreer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman. In another unusual robbery, a young man bicycled up to the drive-in window of a <LOCATION> Catonsville </LOCATION> bank and placed a knapsack containing a note and black box wrapped in duct tape in the drawer. The note said the box contained a bomb, police said. `` You have 40 seconds to fill this bag with $ 100,000,'' the note read. `` The alarms have been fixed so that the bomb will explode if alarms are triggered and we will all die. You now have 30 seconds.'' Police said the teller placed an undisclosed amount of money in the knapsack and the robber pedaled away. There was no bomb. No arrests were made in either case.

<HEAD>Illicit Home Taping Cuts Music Sales as Much as 22 Percent, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Home taping may be causing as much as a 22 percent loss in prerecorded music sales, a congressional report said Saturday. The report, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will use as it considers possible legislation dealing with existing taping and future taping from new technologies such as digital audio tape and erasable-recordable compact discs, showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped recorded music in the previous year. That compared with 21-22 percent in a 1978-79 survey, but was about the same as 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said. The survey also found that most people tape from their own recordings or those of family members and that they think the practice should continue to be allowed without extra compensation to recording artists or manufacturers. But, overwhelmingly, they thought taping for sale was wrong. `` Tapers and non-tapers agreed that taping ` to save money' was acceptable, but taping ` to make money' was wrong,'' the study said. `` It is noteworthy that none of the alternative approaches of limiting recording technology or imposing new fees seemed to have an identifiable constituency among the public,'' <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In general, tapers, purchasers of prerecorded products and nontapers seemed to feel that it was fair to leave current home taping practices unchanged.'' OTA, which advises <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on technological issues, said the survey was conducted by phone with 1,501 people last September and October. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. OTA found that 57 percent of those who had taped in the previous year thought they could have bought the material if they had wished. Of those, 49 percent said they would have bought it if they had been unable to tape. In 77 percent of the cases in which the taper could have purchased, the taper said that if he or she had bought the recording, it would have been in addition to other recordings purchased, rather than in place of them. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> concluded that about 22 percent -LRB- .57 multiplied by .49 multiplied by .77 -RRB- `` of the most recent tapings from prerecorded formats displaced sales of prerecorded music that might have otherwise been made, if the respondent could not tape.'' OTA acknowledged, however, that the figure could be `` excessively high'' since other studies have shown that half or fewer of respondents answering affirmatively to hypothetical questions actually engage in the behavior being studied. Thus, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said, the 22 percent figure should be considered the upper limit. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> noted, however, that the findings also indicated that if people were unable to make the tapes, `` over three-fourths of the tapes that would have been made would not be replaced by sales of prerecorded music.'' The survey providing some good news for the music industry, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Music tapers, in general, had a greater interest in music, listened to more music and purchased more recorded music products than did non-tapers,'' <PERSON> OTA </PERSON> said. `` While home taping certainly displaced some sales of prerecorded music sales of prerecorded products, survey data also pointed to some stimulative effects. Home tapes had value in promoting songs and performers. In addition, a significant number of purchasers bought prerecorded products with the intention of copying them,'' <PERSON> OTA </PERSON> said. Most copying was for `` place-shifting,'' that is, copying music from records and compact discs to the more portable cassette format for Walkman-type players and car decks, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said. The result was that tapers were far more likely to purchase a record or more expensive CD than a prerecorded audiocassette, the study said. The study primarily was devoted to audio taping, not video taping. But the survey found that `` most videocassette recordings, unlike their audio counterparts, were made for temporary use,'' primarily `` time-shifting'' for viewing at a more convenient time. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s landmark MCA-Sony case in 1984 said home video taping of over-the-air broadcast material for time-shifting purposes was allowed. The court did not address the taping of cable TV or pay television programs, or the issue of `` library building'' of recorded programs, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> survey found that 75 percent of those questioned thought it was acceptable to copy a record, tape or CD they owned for their own use. Only 11 percent found the practice unacceptable. Most people, 76 percent, found it unacceptable to sell a copy made from their own tapes, records or CDs. Other findings showed that of respondents 17 years and older: _ 56 percent said it would be unfair to make recorders that wo n't copy and 55 percent deemed it unfair to make prerecorded music _ 57 percent said it would be unfair to add a copyright fee to recorders to compensate recording artists for home taping, and 59 percent thought the same thing about a fee on blank tapes

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today denounced Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision to end a ceasefire with the Contras as a `` shameful blow to democracy,'' but urged the U.S.-backed rebels to refrain from military attack with elections looming in February. At a news conference on the final day of talks with leaders from throughout the hemisphere, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped a question about whether he would seek a resumption of military aid to the rebels, saying any such decision was premature. `` I do n't think the Contras ought to attack,'' he said of the small force of rebels operating within <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` What we ought to do is fulfill the agreements'' forged by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. Under the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had agreed to hold free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in February and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld military aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke after <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declined to specify when his own troops would resume offensive actions. `` I do n't want to abuse the hospitality of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and so the date on which the cease-fire will be suspended will be announced in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would continue observing the 19-month ceasefire if non-lethal American aid currently going to the Contras were made available only to demobilize the U.S.-backed rebels. The rival news conferences demonstrated the extent to which the ceasefire issue had overwhelmed <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' carefully planned two-day `` celebration of democracy.'' The international gathering was ending later in the day with the dedication of a public plaza _ with both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on the guest list. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Friday night that he was ending the cease-fire because of `` savage attacks'' by Contra forces on peasants trying to register to vote. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the `` world was dismayed'' by the announcement and that `` a break of that agreement and a renewal of all-out fighting would be a very bad thing for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>.'' The president made his comments after a meeting with a group of Latin American leaders, including opponents to <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to emphasize his distaste for the pair He chided <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for being the only leader to wear `` a military uniform in this meeting of democracies'' and said the announcement was an affront to <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. `` It's a shameful blow to democracy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. As for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader, he said, `` the outlaw <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime simply must be replaced.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it appeared that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> might be hedging his threat to lift the cease-fire, but noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had not had a chance to fully review his latest comments. But asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be prepared to help the Contras, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` You're asking me to buy into a hypothesis that might not be true ... I want to see what develops. But he knows if there is a military offensive that is going to change the equation 180 degrees.'' Asked to elaborate, he said, `` We'll let you know.'' He grew more acerbic about the Sandinista leader as his 40-minute news conference progressed, describing <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as `` that unwanted animal at the garden party.'' He added, `` We did n't come here to have any contretemps with this little man showing up at a democracy meeting in a military uniform.'' The president urged <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> not to interfere with the elections set for next February, and said, `` the people of this hemisphere know the difference between real elections and sham elections.'' Discussions of drugs and debt issues dominated Friday's opening-day of the meetings, but tensions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> overshadowed the three-hour official session and a lavish state dinner Friday evening Going into the meeting, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had refused to sign any communique stemming from the meeting if <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also signed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> greeted each other at the opening session with a handshake, but the Nicaraguan president _ stung by days of hostile rhetoric from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ announced soon after the meeting that he was ending the cease-fire that had been in effect with the Contras since March 1988. `` The drop of water that made the glass spill over was the attack that the mercenaries launched on Oct. 22, the last day of voter registration, when campesinos who wanted to vote were assassinated,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told an audience of about 3,000 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rica </ORGANIZATION>. He said 19 peasants had been killed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials acknowledged skirmishing had occurred but said they could not tell who started it, and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> suggested the Contras might have been defending themselves. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he found it `` more than passing strange'' that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> never mentioned the cease-fire in the three-hour group meeting. `` Maybe he was too ashamed to bring it up there with the other heads of state in attendance,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>, leader of an opposition lawyers' group, claimed that recent attacks attributed to the Contras actually were the work of government troops `` to impede the democratic process in this country. But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said in a radio interview that the Nicaraguan government `` has the responsibility to be absolutely firm against terrorism.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a point of greeting both <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, the opposition presidential candidate in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition, at Friday's opening session, which they attended as guests. Observers contend that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> handily won the May 7 Panamanian election that was subsequently invalidated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the leaders in their afternoon meeting discussed a proposed drug summit, but no date or place was set.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Saturday: First a statement and then some questions Be glad to respond. Together with the other democratic leaders of the hemisphere, I've just met with the leaders of the political opposition in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And here in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, saluting 100 years of democracy, these discussions, sponsored by <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s main political parties, serve as an especially fitting tribute to the spirit of the occasion and the spirt of the times. And these courageous leaders left us with a stronger appreciation of the daily difficulties of the pro-democracy movements in these two countries. I conveyed to them the encouragement and the admiration of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. And it's ironic that the shining example of Latin American democracy in which we meet lies between two nations whose rulers have so long and so harshly ignored the will of their own people. From <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s promising new plebiscite to the Alaska-Soviet border we opened after 40 years, a new breath of freedom has swept the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> with hope and freedom, hope and opportunity, and bringing us even closer to the world's first completely democratic hemisphere A few nations, however, have been left behind, shackled by failed ideology and failed leadership. To the north, the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> people have waited for democracy since they ended the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> regime 10 years ago, that dictatorship. And elections are planned for next February, but, to date ... there are some disturbing signs. The world, I believe, is dismayed at Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s announcement last night that he had unilaterally ended the cease-fire. I understand there may have been some refinements on that today, but that was what he said. And it's a shameful blow to democracy, and the fact that no mention of this came during the course of the hours of dialogue that we all had, the presidents of these democracies, demonstrates just how shameful an act it truly is. Regarding the forthcoming elections, as was so evident in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the people of this hemisphere know the difference between real elections and sham elections. And the hemisphere will not settle for anything less than free and fair elections. The people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> know the kind of steps that the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> can take to show a real commitment to fair elections. And the whole world will be watching this one. And if the Sandinistas do n't allow fair debates and clean elections, they confirm the dictatorship long before the elections even take place. The world understands that no real democracy is threatened by the voices of its own people. And it's ironic that here we are, and I'm so glad I came to this meeting to salute <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s hundred years of democracy. It was very ironic. There was only one man in a military uniform in this meeting of democracies. Speaking of military uniforms, speaking of dictatorships, to the south, the outlaw <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime simply must be replaced. This is not the judgment of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. It is the judgment of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, and it is the judgment of history, and it is the judgment, I believe, of every single democratically elected president who was at this meeting. Today <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may think his lead-pipe politics have won. But he's won nothing more than a fragile status quo, and democracy really will triumph in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. I'm confident of that. It's a question of when, not if, and by putting his own personal interests above those of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will only continue to lose support internationally, inside the Panamanian defense forces, and among the growing number of courageous Panamanians who dare to resist his oppressive rule. Let me assure you, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to work with the democracies in this hemisphere and around the world to support the struggle of the Panamanian people. Today, every continent is being swept by the new breeze of political change. And the world has watched in wonder as brave men and women have taken to the streets to claim their rights, to proclaim a faith in democracy. Some governments respond with reform, some with repression, but there is no longer any doubt which side history is on. The day of the despot, the day of the dictator is over, finished. The Nicaraguans and Panamanians with whom I've just met are brave and inspiring people. They stand in the vanguard of history, and they deserve the active support of all who support democracy in this hemisphere. I'd be glad to respond to questions. MORE

<HEAD>SAN JOSE: respond to questions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q. Mr. President, Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says that the cease-fire wo n't hold because of what he calls `` savage attacks by the U.S.-backed contras.'' To what extent does the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bear responsibility for the actions of the contras? And what kind of instructions will you send to the contra field commanders now, in view of the end of the cease-fire? A. Well, first I wo n't listen to Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s charge that this is _ his outrageous breach of this _ alleged breach of the cease-fire, willingness to breach it is entirely _ <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> _ willing to bear the burden _ put it all on the contras. There have been flare-ups up there. We have encouraged the contras not to take aggressive military action, and we would certainly continue to do that. But to accept his judgment that some excuse for ending the cease-fire rests totally on the contras, I'm not going to do that at all. Q. -LRB- inaudible -RRB- did you say that you wo n't _ encourage them not to take aggressive action? A. Oh, yeah _ we'll Q. cease-fire is ending and they're going on the attack A. Who's that? Q. If the Sandinistas are ending the cease-fire to go on the attack? A. Well I think they're violating and breaking the very _ very agreements they've made if they do that. And I do n't think they should, and I do n't think the contras ought to attack. What we ought to do is fulfill the agreements that have been made. They agreed to stop subverting their neighbors, for example, I'm talking about <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. My golly, the other day we uncover a great truck of munitions going in. And one of the dramatic moments yesterday was when Mr. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, the fairly elected president of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, in a very diplomatic way I might add, told him, `` Stop sending that stuff into our country. You agreed you would n't do it, and now you're doing it. You agreed to talk to the resistance.'' That's who they ought to talk to. He's always kind of sidling up to me looking for some photo op _ what he ought to do is talk to the resistance. That's what he agreed to do. Why does n't he do it? And he agreed to release the political prisoners. Not so. Has n't done it Conditions for free and fair access to the media, they agreed to that, and that has n't taken place the way it should. There's some signs that are good. The registration, let's say, hey that's good. We're encouraged, some 90 percent supposed to have registered. No government resources are supposed to go to the campaign. I'm told that has been violated. So rather than find a canard, rather than find some hook to break up an agreement on, I think they ought to go forward and honor the agreement that's been made. And I would also say I would encourage the contras in every way possible not to engage in military action. ... Q. What are your options? What can you do since it's very clear that you are at a meeting where, I would say most of the Latin leaders would not want to resume military action or aid to the contras, and so forth? That's obviously _ this is the peace meeting. So what do you have in mind, what have you done so far, knowing this for 18 hours or so? A. Well one of the things I did is talk to those who have a little more influence with Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> than I do, that would be everybody at the meeting, probably, and talked to several of them last night and they leaned on him pretty hard. And there was _ to be fair about it, I'm told at a press conference the man had a little bit of backing off, a little bit. And so let's wait and see, is what I'm saying. But right now I could use this forum to say: Do not break that cease-fire. Q. -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- A. Well, we're not going to cross that bridge till we get there. Yes, way in the back. Yes, sir. Q. Mr. President, I am journalist from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and I want to do a question specifically of my country. A. Sure. Q. The first are _ are there any signs that peace in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is near, and what are these signs? And the other one is, with respect to the human rights in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, would you say that your government is satisfied? A. I would say on the first part _ and I got this from the other presidents _ a recognition that the election in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, free and certifiably fair, was an important major step towards the peace that the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> want. I must say that the shipment that was discovered of Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> shipping military weapons into _ into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in a direct violation of this _ these agreements was a bad sign, but _ what was the second part of your question? So, in other words, I am more encouraged about peace there. I believe Mr. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is trying very hard, and let me just say he has the full support of our government, whatever that -- whatever we can do to help him facilitate the peace and to enhance the democracy. There was a second part, though, that I'm not sure I responded to. MORE

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today defended his veto of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.4 billion budget, saying he will stand like `` a brick wall'' against any attempt to use public funds for abortions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, here for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> meeting on democracy, vetoed the measure Friday despite protests that the veto could impede the city's anti-crime effort. The bill would have restored the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to pay for abortions for poor women with local taxpayers' funds, not federal money. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week vetoed a $ 157 billion appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> that would have allowed Medicaid to pay for abortions nationwide for victims of rape or incest. Asked at a news conference how he justified blocking the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> from using its own funds for abortions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't think public money ought to go for that, except in the life of the mother. ... They can push me for political advantage every time they want to, and they're going to be up against a brick wall.'' `` The people that are being victimized by those kinds of political games are the people in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> complained that a $ 32 million extra federal payment for a series of anti-crime measures will now be delayed for at least a month. `` The president has shown his willingness to sacrifice the public safety of the citizens of the nation's capital in order to appeal to a one-issue constituency,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said, `` We find it ironic that at the same time the president is vetoing this anti-crime, anti-drug appropriations package, he is in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> ... to celebrate the centennial of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule in that country. Yet, while he is away, we are having dictatorial rule here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The budget was for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Teachers, Students March for Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of teachers, students and labor union activists marched in the capital Saturday to demand the government approve a banned teachers' union. Police armed with tear gas followed them. About 3,000 protesters marched near downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, while 1,000 riot police with tear gas followed. The police did not intervene and reported no arrests. Twenty trade unions sponsored Saturday's march, which included hundreds of high school students and dissidents. The government has outlawed the union, contending it has been used by leftists to spread revolutionary ideas among students. Hundreds of teachers have been disciplined or dismissed so far this year in connection with the union movement. Teachers say the movement is aimed at educational reform and has no political purposes.

 A draft report by a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study group says homosexuals trying to join the military have stronger qualifications and fewer problems in their backgrounds than their heterosexual counterparts. `` These results appear to be in conflict with conceptions of homosexuals as unstable, maladjusted persons,'' the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> concludes. The center analyzes what kind of people can be trusted with classified information. The report, conducted early this year, was leaked to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who want the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to reverse its policy against allowing gays and lesbians into the military. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., an avowed homosexual, gave a copy Friday to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> The report compares the background records of 166 gays and lesbians who entered the military and were subsequently discharged because of their sexual preference with those of heterosexuals who were in the military. `` The preponderance of the evidence presented indicates that homosexuals show preservice suitability-related adjustment that is as good or better than the average heterosexual,'' the report's author, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> concludes The 23-page report looked at school conduct records, thinking skills, adjustment to military life and substance abuse. Homosexuals performed better except in all except the drug and alcohol abuse categories. The report cautioned that relatively few homosexuals were surveyed in the report compared with some 42,000 heterosexuals. `` Less confidence should be placed in conclusions drawn from small samples,'' <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said. One argument against homosexuals in the military it that they pose security risks because someone could use the threat of exposure to blackmail them into spying. <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said that removing discrimination would remove the problem. The report is the second in as many weeks released to media organizations that raises questions about the Pentagon policy toward homosexuals. A longer, 1988 study by the same center concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> should let homosexuals enter military service. The new report makes no policy recommendation but instead suggests further study. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the earlier report was rejected because `` it was not responsive to the original research request: whether there is any connection between personnel security and sexual orientation.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said a completed report from the center on that subject is expected by the end of the year. He said the second report also had not been released because it was in draft form and had not gone through a complete review. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> currently stands by its policy against homosexuals in military service. `` Homosexuality is not compatible with military life,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Several court decisions have upheld the military's policy, although a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> determined in May that career officer <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> could re-enlist because the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had known of his homosexuality when he re-enlisted in the past. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy which discriminates against gays and lesbians employs precisely the same arguments used against blacks and women before they were integrated into the armed services, namely, that their inclusion is ` contrary to good order and discipline,''' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> says there is no political climate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pressure the Pentagon to change. <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> accused the military of withholding the reports from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public simply because they ran contrary to current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> policy. The new report `` is another eloquent statement requested by and then subsequently rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>San Francisco Magnitude Quake Likely to Strike East in Next 20 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists say there is a 90 percent chance a quake as strong as the one that just wrecked part of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area will hit the more-unprepared eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within 20 years. `` All of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is subjected to risk, so <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> thinks about it an awful lot,'' said engineer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thinks about it a fair amount. In the East, I do n't think the public awareness is at the level where one would like it to be.'' Earthquakes were relatively common in the eastern states in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, but few have occurred this century. That has raised fears that tension is building deep underground, waiting to be suddenly released in a damaging tremor. `` There have been some studies recently which indicate that the chances of a significant quake, with a reading of 6.5 and above, is greater than 90 percent in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within the next 20 years,'' <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, a civil engineering professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said such a quake `` would affect more people and there would probably be more damage because of the differences in building code requirements in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as opposed to the East.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a seismologist at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, region, which was hit by major tremors in 1811-12, is considered one of the most hazardous in terms of potential earthquake activity in the East. That could be serious for cities such as <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> that are built largely on sediment deposited by the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> over the centuries. It was similar mud fill in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area where the greatest damage occurred in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. Filled land in a former lakebed also was blamed for the massive destruction in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake a few years ago. A devastating quake struck <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, in 1886, and serious quakes also have been felt around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virginia-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border, along the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other states. A tremor shook <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the 1800s. Such a tremor, if repeated today, could cause as much as $ 7 billion in damage to the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> has said. <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON>, who was director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last year that a destructive earthquake is almost certain to strike the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sometime in the next two decades. While scientists can not predict when or where the quake might hit, or its strength, they consider one almost sure to occur in the East before the year 2010, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said. It's `` an almost sure thing ... we just do n't know where or when,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beavers </PERSON>, an engineer with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Beavers' warning is detailed in a study of the earthquake hazard to energy systems, published by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> Particularly vulnerable to tremors in the eastern states, he noted, are schools. Largely constructed of unreinforced brick and masonry, many deaths and injuries could result if a quake struck in the eastern states during daytime hours. <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said that in structures not designed to resist quakes, such as homes, similar amounts of damage would be expected in either <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or the East. But larger buildings, termed `` engineered structures,'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are designed to meet fairly stringent building codes and thus would be expected to withstand seismic shaking better than similar facilities in the East, said <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>. `` Also,'' he said, `` people in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> have planned for earthquakes. There are emergency response plans which municipalities have, utilities, water systems, and so forth. ... In the East that kind of planning has not been as common.'' In 1811 and 1812, a series of quakes shifted the land around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, so drastically that the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was said to flow backwards for a time. The huge <ORGANIZATION> Reelfoot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was created by that tremor and the ground shook as far away as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. A similar series of tremors could be expected to kill 200 to 5,000 people, injure 8,000 and leave an estimated 250,000 homeless in the nearby <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> vicinity, scientists have estimated Damage would extend to such cities as <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Poplar Bluff, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, Ark. An additional problem for the East is the fact that quakes there are felt over a larger area than those that strike the western states. `` The attenuation is different in the East than the West,'' explained <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>. `` If you have a have a magnitude 7 quake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the distance that people feel it is maybe 100 ... to 250 miles. If the same event occurred in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the area able to feel the motion would be much larger ... because the damping in the rocks in the East is not as large as in the West.'' He compared the East to `` a puddle of water where you throw a stone in and waves move outward'' and said, `` The West is more like a puddle of heavy oil where the waves die out rapidly.'' Also, quakes are not as narrowly defined in the East. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the tremors occur along the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andreas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION>, which divides two great plates of the earth's crust. In the East, the nearest plate border is the middle of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, so quakes in the eastern states are at the center of a giant plate rather than along an edge. `` It's as if you had a large disk and were pressing at the edge and it cracked somewhere in the middle, as opposed to two disks rubbing together,'' said <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Q. Yes. With respect to the human rights in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, would you say that your government is satisfied? A. Well, there's been dramatic progress, and nothing has been called to my attention that makes me dissatisfied, but I do n't want to take one look and say that everything is perfect. I ca n't say that. I do know that the administration is trying very _ the new administration _ very, very hard, and dramatic improvements have been made. Q. Mr. President, you say you really do n't want to take any action until this thing clarifies itself with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, but does n't there have to be some kind of stick employed here in terms of the contras now Are n't you honor-bound to help them defend themselves if indeed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are about to unlaunch some sort of offensive against them? A. Well, if it resulted _ I mean, you're asking me to buy into a hypothesis that may not be true. Q. He talks of breaching it. A. Well, he's talking about it, and you've got a lot of presidents here that are trying to tell him that would be sheer folly, so I want to see how it develops. But he knows that if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees. Q. Mr. President, you have placed great faith in regional diplomacy, your relations with leaders in this hemisphere like the leaders gathered here. What does it tell you about the effectiveness of such an approach when a man like <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> feels free to walk into a gathering like this, and at this very meeting, announce an action which is an insult to every leader here and a violation of the agreements that you've cited? A. It tells me that I should not judge the whole hemisphere by one _ I heard it, I heard one of our leading TV journalists use an analogy about an animal at a garden party, yesterday, and I wo n't do it because it might take on different _ but that's exactly what happened, so am not going to judge a salute to democracy _ a hundred years of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> democracy _ by the fact that Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> looks like that unwanted _ unwanted animal at a garden party And, I'm _ so _ what you're doing is focusing on _ and I understand it _ the controversy, the one thing. There has been _ the feeling on parts in some countries here, of neglect by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under this president, there will no longer ever be a feeling of neglect, and we came here to talk about debt and drugs and democracy, and we're not going to let this one little man _ who is out of whack with the rest of the hemisphere _ ruin a very good meeting. Q. Does n't it suggest, sir, that he feels he has nothing to fear from the regional diplomacy by which you have set such great store, when he feels free to do what he has done here? A. If he goes forward with it, yes, and it will bring down on him the outrage of every president and those that invited him here, I'm sure, will be terribly disappointed. But we did n't come here to have any contretemp with this little man, showing up in his military uniform at a democracy meeting. That's not what it's all about. We're talking about much broader things, but we'll _ let's wait and see how that develops He knows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' position, and he knows the position of others in the hemisphere ... Q. Do you foresee a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy towards <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> directly because of this meeting? A. I see an enhanced interaction, and I do n't see a dramatic change, because I'm one and our defense _ I mean our secretary of state and our interests have long been intertwined with those in this hemisphere, but I see a day of the democracy _ hemisphere total democracy.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> on Saturday reaffirmed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s military commitment to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, saying cuts are unlikely while large Soviet and East German contingents surround the divided city. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> is on a three-week European tour to talk with allied government leaders and visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. He arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> late Friday after two days of talks with West German leaders in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. During a welcoming ceremony at <LOCATION> Charlottenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> would likely be `` one of the last places'' where troop reductions would be made under future superpower disarmament agreements. ` My personal view is that we could n't make any adjustments'' as long as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is surrounded by large numbers of Soviet and East German forces, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` engagement in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will continue to see <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> stays free'' and he lauded `` the courage and determination'' of West Berliners who stand in `` an outpost of freedom in a sea of communism.'' He also called on <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to tear down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, which he said `` continues to be a symbol of a ... philosophy which leads to oppression of people.'' The three allied powers _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ have a total of 12,500 troops stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>SAN JOSE: total democracy.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 You look at the changes that are taking place, that have taken place in the last few years and that are likely to take place just in the next few months, and it's very optimistic, and we want to be a constructive part of helping with the debt problem that I heard a lot about yesterday. We want to help, where we can, enhance democracy and strengthen the concept of free elections. So, I would n't say dramatic change, but I think being here and saying what I feel about the democracies here and trying to show the respect we feel for those democracies is a good thing to have done. ... Q. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> invited here the democratically elected presidents. Are you questioning his decision of inviting <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>? A. Well, I was a little surprised to feel that he was democratically elected, though they reminded me that there was an election. I'm not sure how certifiably free and fair it was, but it was under that _ under that rubric that he was invited here. So, who am I to question our host? I'm glad to be here myself. But it did seem a little odd, walking in in a military uniform and, you know, coming in having pledged democracy to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> eight or nine years ago and frustrating the democratic ambitions of his people. It was n't exactly the most comfortable fit But no, I'm not questioning Mr. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. He's the host, and he's been a generous host, and I'm very glad we're here to salute <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s democracy. ... Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about another foreign policy subject. There's very strong evidence that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is involved in a joint project with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to build a nuclear missile. If that project should continue, what effect would it have on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>? A. Well, we _ I hope our position is clear in transfer of any military technology that should not be transferred. And if that's taken place, it would not enhance relations between us or any country that does that It _ it would complicate things. There's no question about that. Q. Another question on that same general subject, sir. Will the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> give <LOCATION> Isreal </LOCATION> a veto over the identity of the Palestinians in negotiations on elections in the occupied territories? A. We are not _ we are not going with preconditions on _ we are trying to be a catalyst, and whatever is worked out between the parties will have our _ our generous and enthusiastic support. But the Israelis have made clear that that would be very difficult for them, so we're not trying to throw down a precondition. We're just trying, through the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> five points and through giving support to President's <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10 points, to be helpful in getting the talks going. And the main thing is to talk, and I hope that they'll get together. ... Q Mr. President, you mentioned that if there's an all-out offensive, this would change the equation 180 degrees. What exactly do you mean? Are you talking about more military aid again to the contras? A. We'll let you know. We'll let you know. But I do n't _ see _ I do n't want to get out ahead of where I think things may be right now. You're pressing me to act as if there is a fait accompli and all barriers are down and shooting starts on all sides. I do n't want to argue that that is what's going to take place And _ but I can tell you, a break of that agreement, and a renewal of all-out fighting would be a very bad thing for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, because I think the whole world would see it as a direct breaking of his word, and then we would see what kind of action is taken. ...

 History placed <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on opposite ends of a philosophical spectrum but their daughters have found a middle ground. <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Attallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON> are co-founders of a theater company, Nucleus, which tours the country with its production, `` Stepping Into Tomorrow,'' a play with a stay-in-school message for young people. They live on opposite ends of the country _ Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. This weekend's performances at the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> gave them several days to get together as friends _ for the first time in five years `` Maybe we'll try to see a movie _ next week,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> joked. Not everybody's father was one of the most important black leaders of all time, one who led thousands with his own brand of moral thought before being felled by an assassin's bullet. But that's the reality for both Ms. King and Ms. <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON>. `` There's a bond between us because of the way in which our fathers achieved their success,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` Their notoriety came through the people, the people being the least of these, the left out and oppressed and exploited. So it's a different kind of celebrity status.'' The two men had vastly different views on ways to achieve equality for blacks. King believed in black liberation through passive resistance, and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> advocated violent confrontation before he converted to traditional Islam and became <PERSON> El-Hajj </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Shabazz </PERSON>. But their daughters point out that their fathers did have one meeting _ albeit brief _ in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1964. And <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> King </PERSON> was jailed there, but prison officials would n't let him visit, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` The reality is that there was a real effort made to kind of keep them separate,'' she said. `` I feel that there was a sense of brotherhood,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON> said. `` I feel that there was an uncle in King for me.'' The daughters met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1979, while both were trying to eke out careers in the performing arts. They were introduced by a writer friend who pointed out how much they had in common and thought their getting together would make a heck of a story. `` After the guy invited us to do the interview, I said, ` Oh fine, sure. It is kind of coincidental that these commonalities exist,''' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` There was something there from the very beginning.'' But both were a little apprehensive. `` I was nervous. Just nervous, because this was <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s daughter, somebody famous, who is the child of someone you admire,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON> said. `` And also a little concerned about what her impression of me and my family might be, based on the perpetuation of how the public always portrayed our parents _ <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, at ends, at odds, competing.'' That interview led to offers to speak to young people, then the creation of Nucleus. It also left them on the road, together, with a lot of time to talk. `` It got rid of the formality,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON> said. `` We got to hear about <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> or <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. We got to hear about the one ... who rode you on the back of the bicycle. It was moving for us, something that kept bringing us together.'' `` The fact that our fathers were assassinated ... puts us in a different place in terms of the way people reach out,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` I think very few people could share that with me.''

 Just 36 hours after helping free Buck Helm from the wreckage of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, two rescue workers were busy seeking a missing hunter in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> have orchestrated countless rescues as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tuolumne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, but never has one followed so quickly on the heels of another. `` After awhile, the memory fades. But those two, back-to-back, that's going to to be there forever. Certainly, it's an event of a lifetime,'' <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. Helm's rescue, after 85 hours beneath tons of concrete and steel that had been a double-decker highway before the 7.1 magnitude quake Oct. 17, was touted as a miracle. But <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON>, who with Stone coordinated both rescues, found the less-publicized search for hunter <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON> more challenging. `` For <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. For Buck, the needle was right in front of you. It was just a matter of reaching in and getting it,'' <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said. `` With Buck, once the medics got there, we knew we'd get him out alive. With <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, we were n't sure if we'd get him out alive.'' <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> had been back from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> for only a day and a half, trying to recover from their exhaustive earthquake efforts, when they received word Tuesday that <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON>, 24, was missing in the <ORGANIZATION> Stanislaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON> became lost after tracking a wounded buck into the woods and got caught by a swift-moving storm that dumped 6 inches of snow over the area. The odds of finding him in the large search area 5,000 feet above sea level were very slim after temperatures had dropped to below freezing, <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON>, an experienced hunter and volunteer firefighter, helped himself by hiking to lower elevations away from the storm and found shelter before nightfall each day, said <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON>. He was rescued on Thursday. On the other hand, <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said he never doubted that the Helm rescue would be successful, even though he was found in what <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> described as the most unstable part of the freeway. `` Frankly, I felt comfortable with it. I did n't do anything I felt was unsafe,'' said <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON>. `` The only think that on occasion would kind of pop up in the back of my mind was an aftershock.''

 Q. Just the second part of that _ why did <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> do this, do you think? A. I ca n't figure it out! It's an offense to the president of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. It is an offense to the democratically elected leaders here. It is the most outrageous use of a meeting on democracy that I can think of. I ask our own folks _ what in heaven's name would make a person do something so counterproductive _ stick him out like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democratically elected leaders, offend a host? And I'm sure it has _ you can ask <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, but if I were him, I would have been deeply offended by such brutal disregard for the feelings of the _ sensitivities of this meeting. So, I do n't know what motivates this man. I did see him there yesterday, and you know, I knew you all wanted to see the photos and the confrontation. That's Boy Scout stuff. I mean, there's no _ you know, he wants to talk to me? Talk to the resistance. That's what he agreed to do That's who he ought to talk to. Do n't go sliding around for some photo opportunity that means nothing. ... Q. Mr. President, I just wanted to get one domestic policy question in here _ A. Fire! Q. At a time when you're endorsing and you're celebrating self-determination abroad and you've endorsed state initiatives in so many areas like education at home, how do you justify refusing to allow <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> residents to use their own local tax money to fund abortions for poor women? A. I do n't think public money ought to go for that, except in the life of the mother. My position is so well-known there and they can push me for political advantage every time they want to, and they're going to be up against a brick wall. So let's forget it and get on with helping the people in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. And that's what they ought to do, and not try to play games to think that one's going one-up or one-down on this very personal, very difficult question of abortion. My position is spelled out, was defined, openly debated in the elections a year ago _ maybe to this very day _ and I'm not changing my position. And they know that. And if they think there's political advantage in pushing me to the wall, fine But the people that are being victimized by those kinds of political games are the people in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Q. Mr. President, there seems to be a consensus that the government that should be in power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at this moment is Mr. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s, since he won a fair election. However, hemispheric presidents passed up the opportunity to recognize that government last September. Could you explain why this happened? A. It happened because there was an action, the presidents agreed to work with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and to back _ strongly back the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission. And, in my view, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission failed in its mission, and that was to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power and then go forward. Now you're having some constructive suggestions by <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, the prime minister of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, by others at the meeting here. But I can _ what'll be the next step I ca n't tell you. But it _ I am not _ put it this way, I am not totally frustrated about the return of democracy to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. I think that the thing I sense from these leaders is such solidarity with free and fair elections _ and that was what happened in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ that the handwriting is on the wall for Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But whether at this juncture recognition of that government would be a constructive step or not, I'd want to talk to others. It'd have to be done in concert with other nations to be meaningful. And we are encouraging people not to give any kind of formal recognition to the existing crowd by, you know, not having their ambassadors there and all. ... Q. In your discussions here did you move in any sense a step closer towards a drug summit? Did you get strong support on that? MORE

 A. I made very clear in my comments yesterday that we look forward to the _ having this Andean drug summit. Whether any plans were finalized on it, I do n't know. I'd have to ask our experts whether _ could we have had some discussion of trying to pin down with _ particularly with the Colombians what would be a good timeframe for that. But I personally did n't go any further than just saying we enthusiastically support the concept, and we will be pleased to attend. ... Q. Have any of the others asked to get involved in the _ A. Ah, not to me, they did n't. This _ this topic got a lot of interest and discussion, but it did n't get into the modalities of the summit that I know of, but maybe there was some behind-the-scenes work with it. ... Q. -LRB- In Spanish -RRB-. A. The second part of your question, no, I do not believe in legalization. I am firmly opposed to it, and I salute <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for its unwillingness to negotiate and bargain with these insidious narco-traffickers. First part was on the summit, yes. I answered that in English a second ago, but yes, I would be happy to attend such a summit and I think it's worthwhile and I made that point yesterday in my intervention. Q. Mr. President, I'd like to take you back to -LRB- the -RRB- question of a moment ago about the reports of an Israeli-South African collaberation on the missiles. Senior administration officials say it's clear something is happening. A. On what's that? Q. On _ on Israeli-South African _ reports of Israeli-South African collaboration on missiles _ transhipment of technology? Administration officials say it's clear something is happening. I want to know, sir, given this country's historical reluctance to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, what kind of leverage we have to deal with the situation. What are you prepared to do? A. Well, you're asking me to accept a hypothesis that I'm not accepting, but I've said that whoever it is, the transfer of forbidden technology is taboo. We're not going to have that, and we will find ways to assert that with any country that abuses the system. ... Q Mr. President, President <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> said 24 hours -LRB- ago -RRB- that he was very frustrated by the state of relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He told us that he perceives that <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not a priority for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that democracy without economic vitality is not enough. As far as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, do you have an announcement to make to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a positive announcement? A. Yeah, you know, I did n't _ I did n't detect that high level of frustration on President <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s point. He made a very strong and very _ an emotional appeal on the debt question, and I can understand that. And we are trying to work with him. The one theme I detected through this meeting was strong support for the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan and the fact that we have moved and the fact where it has taken place, in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, capital flight _ capital is coming back into the country. By doing some of the necessary reforms, why, they have _ for example, deregulation of transportation, they have reduced the cost of transportation by about 30 percent, I am told. So things are moving. But I _ I sensed an urgency by President <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. I can identify with it, and we do want to be helpful. But I think he _ I had a chance to talk with him last night. I think he was very pleased we came. I think he was very pleased we are not, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or indeed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, neglecting our friends in this hemisphere. And so I left with a pretty upbeat feeling, not a diminished feeling of the importance of his problem, but in terms of the hemispheric solidarity, you might say. But I _ your having phrased the question that way, I want to be sure we're not missing a signal with him. He's going out of office next year. He has done a good job under extraordinarily difficult times. I went to his inauguration, and I do n't think anybody ever came into office in any country under more difficult _ difficult times. So I would salute him and say, if he's frustrated about the debt, I can understand it. But I'm not going to let that, nor should he, in any way interfere with what I think are improving relations with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Look over our shoulders, and it was n't long ago that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> did not have the democracy that President <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has tried to perfect, even in spite of enormously difficult economic times. ...

<HEAD>Quake Particularly Stressful For San Francisco's 3,000 AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS patient <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has been told he has just three to six months to live, but when the earthquake hit he ran for his life like everybody else. `` I'm not giving up,'' the 30-year-old man said. `` I do n't want to die. I'm not ready to go.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and others among this city's 3,000 AIDS patients suffered special problems in the Oct. 17 earthquake. Already weakened by the virus, their immune systems made them more susceptible to illness while huddled outside. The quake provided another layer of stress atop the fear of dying. And crucial home health services were disrupted as some nurses could not reach their patients. On the positive side, Project Open Hand, which normally provides 1,500 meals per day to AIDS patients, expanded its normal services by sending 47,600 meals to earthquake relief shelters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> in the past week. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who weighs just 110 pounds and has trouble talking and breathing, was lying in bed when the quake hit at 5:04 p.m. He rushed outside because falling plaster from the walls and ceilings made him fearful of remaining inside. But with his immune system nearly destroyed, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> caught a cold from spending four hours in his back yard. He suffers from what is known as the wasting syndrome, in which he continually loses weight. His lover, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Echols </PERSON>, had to go back into their damaged apartment to get <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s oxygen bottle. Then <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> spent four days at the home of his lover's mother in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, to escape the dust raised by the collapsed plaster. `` I came back and went into shock again,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who has had AIDS for two years. `` Six days after the quake, I went into the emergency room.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was lucky to have <PERSON> Echols </PERSON>' support. `` I was able to deal with it a lot better than most AIDS patients,'' he said, especially those who were home alone. The quake stranded some bedridden patients without telephone service or a nursing visit for more than a day, said <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollema </PERSON>, supervisor of Visiting Nurses and Hospice of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which provides home care for 600 people, including 120 AIDS patients. `` In the first day we had absolutely no telephone contact with our nurses or our patients,'' she said. But many nurses took it upon themselves to visit the most seriously ill patients, and there were no reports of anyone hurt by the delay in care, she said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said AIDS hot lines were down for six days, making it hard for patients to call in for help. The quake increased stress for AIDS sufferers at a time when they are least able to handle it, <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON> said. `` If you are looking at someone with a life-threatening illness and who may or may not be indigent, and factor in the earthquake, you are looking at a very full palette,'' he said. <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON> also said the nearly $ 3.45 billion the federal government quickly produced for disaster relief is much greater than the total spent for AIDS programs this year. Spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the agency is spending $ 1.6 billion on AIDS programs annually and that the total federal spending is just more than $ 2 billion. `` It heightens the low priority the federal government has given to AIDS,'' <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON> said. `` We've had a natural disaster with this epidemic for nine years in the city.'' He also said that private AIDS organizations in the area would likely be strapped for money as donations are channeled to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other relief organizations. `` We are very concerned that we will see a big drop-off,'' <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON> said. Like others in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, AIDS patients were changed by the quake. `` I do n't think that I'll ever settle down from that,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` It does n't help when the news says we have n't had the Big One yet.'' AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. As of mid-October, AIDS had been diagnosed in 109,167 Americans, of whom 64,849 have died, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The chief victims of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.

 Q. One more? A. One more. This is the last _ it really is. We're in real trouble on the time. Q. You said earlier on _ A. -LRB- Aside -RRB- It's all right. Q. _ that the presidents last night leaned on <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Two-part question is, do you think <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, in fact, hurt himself by what he did? A. Yes. Q. And do you think that it's incumbent now on President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> to publicly say so since there's one more ceremony left of this meeting? A. I think that he hurt himself, because I think these leaders here to celebrate democracy saw that this _ that this man is still a bit of an outcast in the whole family around that table. And I think that unconscionable election to hold that press conference yesterday and _ as I say, maybe he's backed off a little. I want to be fair, and he may have backed off about whether he stops the cease-fire or whether he fails, you know, whether it does n't continue There's _ I'm told there's a little trying to interpret what he means by all that. But yes, he hurt himself very, very badly, I think. And maybe _ maybe people will understand more clearly some of the reservations we have when they see him violate the agreements that mean so much to President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and to the other _ to the other leaders that participate in the agreements. I think the intervention by <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, incidentally, yesterday, that nobody disputed, of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s continuing to subvert the Salvadoran democracy, really was profound. It was _ you could hear a pin drop when he said that, and _ because everyone knows it's true. And everyone knows it's in direct violation of an agreement made. So I think he hurt himself, and whether it will reflect himself in talks, I do n't know. I do know that President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> got a hold of him last night and spoke very directly to him. And I'm told that two other presidents _ you can guess about who they might be _ no, you already had a question _ were _ spoke very, very frankly to him. Q. But if I may, the second part of my question _ A. You've had two parts. This is the third part of a two-part question? Q. I'm going for it.. ETX A Okay. Q The second part was, should n't _ given that you've got 16 leaders here, should n't Mr. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> say something publicly, not just ... A. I would hope he would, but I _ that's _ that's his call. I've had a chance here, and I feel better for it Q. Why do you keep calling him a little man? A. Because he is, that's why. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Q. Thank you. END TEXT

<TEXT>
 The army fired scores of rockets at guerrillas Saturday but failed for an eighth day to open the main supply route to the capital. At least 22 guerrilla missiles killed 12 people and closed the airport, officials said. A diplomat who spent most of the day waiting for a flight said air shipments from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had fallen Saturday to three, down from the usual 30 per day. A doctor said rockets fired by U.S.-backed guerrillas on Friday hit a base used to fire Scud missiles, killing six soldiers and wounding 18. Markets again reported no deliveries of flour or fuel. Soldiers of the Soviet-supported government were seen at several locations, stopping taxi drivers and buying gasoline that has topped $ 16 a gallon. Throughout the day, the capital was rocked by the vibrations of departing government rockets shot north to the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the main supply route linking the capital with the Soviet border. Government soldiers with knowledge of the battles said the northern part of the highway was held by Moslem rebels. They said government forces were trying to regain parts of the southern half of the road. More than 2,000 trucks carrying supplies for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> were reported stuck on the highway north of the battles. Up until late last week when it was closed, the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> had been the only government-held land route into the capital. Three other roads, to the east, south and west, have been effectively closed to government trucks. The government-run nightly news said 22 rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday, killing 12 people and injuring 24. Government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said one hit a military base that houses the women's militia headquarters, killing five women. Another missile hit a kindergarten and killed a young girl, said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalalin </PERSON>, head of the children's hospital. More rockets landed near the Polytechnic University in northwest <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, kicking up huge plumes of smoke. Several homes were destroyed, but no deaths were reported. Witnesses said rockets also landed in a nearby military base, but the government does not release data on military casualties in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. A doctor speaking on condition of anonymity said the Scud missile base was hit Friday afternoon by several rockets. The base is controversial because a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence report has alleged that Soviet soldiers are operating the base. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it pulled the last of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February, ending a decade-long intervention. The doctor said six soldiers were killed and 18 were wounded in the attack. All of them, he said, were Afghan soldiers. Since June, when rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> intensified, about 400 people have been killed and more than 900 injured. The government blames the guerrillas, who say the government is rocketing its own people. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the guerrillas<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Friday that government planes bombed a 40-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway to chase off guerrillas and allow <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supplies headed for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to get through. The guerrillas also claimed government troops bombed and rocketed villages along the road. Government spokesman <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> denied it. `` We never rocket villages,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said some of the supplies on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> were from a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid shipment but that it only comprised several truckloads. The guerrillas, who have been fighting the communist government 11 years, say they want to cut off all food and fuel to the capital to force residents to flee. Then, they say they will increase their attacks on the city. When asked where the flour is, merchants at the food markets blow imaginary dust from their fingertips. `` It's gone with the wind'' said one trader.

<HEAD>Government Report Questions Value Of Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report requested by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a strong supporter of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, questions the value of such sanctions against South African gold. `` Even if enforcement were perfect, most sanctions against South African gold might fail to generate substantial direct economic pressure,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in the report, which was released Saturday. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., is a staunch opponent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system of racial segregation and supports additional sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> He had asked the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> to investigate sanctions against gold and diamonds, both key exports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The interim report released Saturday dealt only with gold. In an accompanying press release, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> characterized the report as a `` significant breakthrough on the sanctions issue.'' Asked to reconcile that description with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s position on the sanctions issue, an aide cited one section of the report dealing with discovery by a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientist of tests that can trace the country of origin of refined gold. `` This technology gives us something we could not do before,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The report acknowledged that `` metals combined with gold in jewelry manufacturing may render the test ineffective.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would like to add jewelry made of South African gold to the list of gold items banned in this country. Most South African gold enters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the form of jewelry, mostly made in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the report said. About $ 800 million to $ 900 million worth of that jewelry is imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually. Jewelry was excluded from a 1986 congressional ban in large part because it is difficult to establish the source of gold in imported jewelry, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s office said. As for the critical look at gold sanctions in general, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` We recognize both the porousness of sanctions and their limits.'' But he added that sanctions have political, symbolic, and psychological effects such as lowering business confidence in the economy. He said sanctions are one weapon out of several in the fight against apartheid. Imports of gold Krugerrands and bullion are already banned. Congressional opponents of apartheid, in addition to the jewelry ban, are also mulling the idea of encouraging countries to release South African gold from their central banks and forcing investors to divest all holdings in South African gold mining shares. Throughout the report, however, the view of sanctions was gloomy. `` Even if there were no smuggling and other nations began to adopt a ban on imports of bullion, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> could sell its gold to many alternative markets,'' the report said. Gold accounts for 45 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s export earnings and 10 percent of its government tax revenues, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` Because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest market for gold jewelry in the world and a customer for over 50 percent of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s jewelry exports, it might be able to exert some leverage on jewelry makers to use non-South African gold,'' the report said `` But because the boycott would be directed at imports from jewelry-producing countries rather than directly at South African gold bullion, some chance exists'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be accused of violating international free trade agreements. If sanctions became so effective that mines began to close, `` it would be difficult to reopen them in any post-apartheid society,'' the report said, noting that the pressure of the earth on the deep mines would close them naturally. On current bullion sanctions, it said: `` Because little gold bullion was imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> directly from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> prior to the ban and because knowledge of the boycott in the gold market was not widespread, the ban has had little actual impact reducing South African gold revenues or on the world price.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> could legally avoid sanctions `` by developing alternative markets and might benefit from unintentional speculative price increases,'' the report said. `` Also, releasing gold -LRB- from central banks -RRB- might harm other gold-producing nations at least in the short term'' by depressing prices. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 banned imports of South African minerals, metals, farm goods and products from government-owned or controlled agencies.

 Thousands of pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in two East German cities on Saturday, keeping up pressure on the Communist government to adopt reforms. About 30,000 reform activists protested in <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION>, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said another 6,000 marched in <LOCATION> Greiz </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said marchers in both cities carried placards demanding free elections, travel freedom and legalization of the pro-democracy group New Forum. According to ADN, many in the Plauen march shouted, `` Enough talk, we want action!'' In <LOCATION> Greiz </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said many protesters carried posters showing Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose reforms they support. Also Saturday, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new Communist leadership hinted at further steps to decriminalize escape attempts to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a day after tens of thousands demonstrated in at least six other cities across the nation for pro-democracy reforms. Meanwhile, there were indications several East German political parties allied with the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are seeking greater independence. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogisch </PERSON>, a leader in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgen </ORGANIZATION> Saturday that a `` multi-party system can only work when the political parties act and are true'' to their platforms. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network late Friday said it had information that the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and another Communist-allied party, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, want to pull out of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the union of parties under Communist dominance. According to <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION>, the two parties want to campaign for more seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> based on vote totals and not on a quota system set by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The calls for greater political independence came one day after the Communist government announced important concessions and after thousands took to the streets to demand reforms. The demonstrations in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senftenberg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Saalfeld </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Guestrow </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Grossraeschen </PERSON> late Friday came despite a government decision to grant an amnesty for demonstrators, for people who have left the country illegally, and for thousands who were jailed for trying to escape. The amnesty was the the most dramatic move that <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has taken since he became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief on Oct. 18, replacing hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The government said people who remain in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> after officially permitted trips are finished will be able to return home later without fear of prosecution. The government also said it will restore free travel to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as of Nov. 1. Restrictions were imposed Oct. 3 to stop a rush of East Germans to the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, where they demanded to be allowed to go West. Travel restrictions have been among the most bitter complaints of East Germans. The new government has also promised to allow East Germans greater travel freedoms to the West. About 60,000 East Germans have gone to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since July via <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. By extending leniency to people who left the country illegally, the government clears the way for them to return without facing criminal prosecution. The amnesty covers incidents through Friday, and all prisoners included in the act will be released by Nov. 30, the government said. About 4,000 people are believed jailed for trying to flee West. The country's prosecutor-general, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendland </PERSON>, said future laws were still under discussion, `` but it is already quite certain that the regulation to prosecute those who do n't return from allowed trips will not be in the amended law.'' <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s official newspaper, hinted in a commentary Saturday that attempted escape might be further decriminalized if violence or force was not a factor. `` The amnesty and the new travel law that is being worked out will require changes in the law relating to illegal flight,'' the newspaper said. A liberal travel law, coupled with a decision not to prosecute those who leave and then decide to return, would largely eliminate the need for daring escapes across the border. The government said the amnesty also included people charged with taking part in illegal street protests during weeks of turmoil.

 Armed bandits made off with a priceless ancient Greek and Roman coin collection after locking two museum guards in a broom closet, officials said Saturday. Armed with a pistol and a screwdriver, the thieves demanded Friday night to be taken to the gallery where a celebrated 15th century painting by <PERSON> Antonello </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Messina </PERSON> was displayed. When they discovered the sophisticated alarm system protecting the masterpiece, they chose instead to steal the 250 silver and gold coins. Investigators, who searched for clues in the case Saturday, guessed the criminals were working for someone else. The coins date from the 5th century B.C. and were minted in the ancient Sicilian cities of <PERSON> Cefalu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Agrigento </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Taormina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Siracuse </PERSON> as well as the nearby island of <LOCATION> Lipari </LOCATION>. The collection is considered second in importance only to a similar one in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Medicare Premiums to Rise Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The insurance premium that the nation's 33 million Medicare beneficiaries pay to cover doctor bills will rise to $ 29 a month in 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> announced this weekend. The 1989 rate is $ 27.90 per month. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has decreed that 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> costs _ the physician fee benefit program _ be covered by beneficiary premiums. The other 75 percent is financed from general tax funds. The premium is calculated annually based on program costs. The $ 1.10 increase was in line with previous estimates. Because the program is so heavily subsidized, about 98 percent of those eligible purchase the insurance. The monthly payments are deducted from their Social Security checks. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> also announced that the monthly catastrophic insurance premium, which is on top of the $ 29, will rise to $ 4.90 from $ 4 beginning Jan. 1. That $ 4.90 figure, like the basic premium, had been used in earlier projections. The department announced earlier that the hospital deductible, a fee a Medicare beneficiary pays no more than once a year if hospitalized, is rising from $ 560 this year to $ 592 in 1990. Also calculated annually, the deductible is pegged to costs and represents the average cost of a one-day hospital stay.

<HEAD>Government Increases Reward For Drug Traffickers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Saturday offered $ 600,000 for the capture of either of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s two most powerful drug lords, more than doubling the previous reward. The higher reward was offered in television advertisements run by the government, which has been trying for 10 weeks to crack the highest levels of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s powerful and feared cocaine cartels. The government previously had offered $ 250,000 for the capture of either <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar-Gaviria </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez-Gacha </PERSON>, the leaders of the huge <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. The television spots, run nationwide, show a wanted poster with mug shots of the two suspects. The ad offers $ 606,000 for the capture of either man. The government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has extradited four Colombians to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the drug war began Aug. 18, and nine more are awaiting extradition. However, all are middle-ranking traffickers. None is on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> list of the 12 most-wanted Colombian traffickers, a list topped by <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have said they believe <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and other top members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel are still in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The fugitives, the officials have said, are protected by bribes, fierce loyalty of people they have helped and by outright fear of people who think they will be signing their own death warrants if they try to collect the reward. The government declared war on traffickers following the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. Drug traffickers in turn have waged an almost daily campaign of bombings and killings of officials and journalists in an effort to intimidate the government into ending its crackdown. Meanwhile, 10 young people were killed in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> area Friday night, including five women whose bodies were thrown from moving cars, police there said Saturday. Earlier this week, the bodies of seven teen-agers who had been shot to death were found in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the recruiting ground for drug traffickers' private armies. All of the 17 killed were between the ages of about 17 and 21, a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police spokesman said. The bodies of the young women were thrown from cars in the fashionable neighborhood of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poblado </LOCATION> shortly after midnight Friday, the police spokesman said, asking not to be named. Earlier, gunmen walked into a bar in the town of <LOCATION> Bello </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, opened fire with pistols and killed three young men, the spokesman said. Two more bodies of young men were found in <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> tossed along a roadside, the policeman said. Interviews with gang members in the past in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> have shown that the gangs are trying to prove which are the most powerful and to emulate the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's leaders, especially <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> started out in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> as a pickpocket and car thief. Forbes magazine ranks him as having between $ 2 billion and $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, also a billionaire, was a pig farmer before he got into the cocaine business. The apparent gang war killings came just hours after a young man with a submachine gun killed a state government official in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The victim was <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, the vice president of the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state assembly and the state leader for the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> was the 737th member of the party to be killed by death squads that the attorney general's office says are run by drug traffickers. Drug traffickers are attacking party members in revenge for attempts by leftist guerrillas to kidnap and ransom traffickers and their families, the attorney general's office has said. Meanwhile, bombings by drug traffickers have become so frequent that they are largely played down or ignored by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s newspapers Two bombs Friday night that killed one person and injured two others got little attention in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s five daily newspaper's Saturday Three newspapers did n't even publish news of the bombings, and two others put the news on their inside pages. One bomb went off at the private Guaymaral airport on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police said Saturday in a communique. The bomb, in a bathroom at the airport headquarters for narcotics police, killed a policeman, the communique said. There have now been 171 bombings with 22 people killed and 220 injured since the drug war began.

Qian spoke at a welcoming banquet for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on the first evening of his private visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a guest of the government. The visit is <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s sixth to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, beginning with the 1972 trip that began a rapproachment after decades of hostility. It is his most low-key ever, with even his schedule and length of stay a secret. Reporters were kept at a distance at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport when <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> arrived on a commercial flight and was greeted by Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaqiu </PERSON>. He made no statement and was whisked off in a waiting car to the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> State Guesthouse. `` The overall interests of safeguarding world peace and the long-term interests of our two countries ... require us to make a success of Chinese-U.S. relations,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> as saying in his banquet toast. `` Chinese-U.S. relations are at a crossroads,'' he said. `` We sincerely hope that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will weigh the pros and cons and take a forward-looking approach so that Chinese-U.S. relations may return to the track of normal development at an early date.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s comments were milder and more hopeful than any other recent government statements, most of which have bitterly accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of interfering in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> affairs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s use of the army in June to crush student pro-democracy protests and its subsequent arrests of thousands of protesters and dissidents. It also has given refuge in its embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to two well-known dissidents, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, and has told tens of thousands of Chinese studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that they can overstay their visas for one year if they fear political persecution at home. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the current tension, but only indirectly, and emphasized common ground. `` The present difficulties in Chinese-U.S. relations are not what we would like to see nor what we have created,'' he said. `` Differences between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in social system, ideology and other aspects do not necessarily hinder the establishment and development of normal friendly relations.'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> usually only summarizes and paraphrases banquet toasts but it quoted <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> at length, indicating the government intends his remarks to be seen as an important statement of policy toward <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> described himself as a `` friend of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' and expressed concern about relations. He said ties between countries could not be based solely on friendship, and that U.S.-Chinese relations were essential to both sides because of shared interests. `` A strong and stable <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also is very essential to world peace, and the two countries' ties should be safeguarded and strengthened,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, which only summarized <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s toast, paraphrased him as saying. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> is the most prominent American to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the June crackdown. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has halted all high-level official exchanges. However, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, said the former president would report to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after his trip.

 Just 36 hours after helping free Buck Helm from the wreckage of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, two rescue workers were busy seeking a missing hunter in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> have orchestrated countless rescues as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tuolumne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, but never has one followed so quickly on the heels of another. `` After awhile, the memory fades. But those two, back-to-back, that's going to to be there forever. Certainly, it's an event of a lifetime,'' <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. Helm's rescue, after four days beneath tons of concrete and steel that had been a double-decker highway before the 7.1 magnitude quake Oct. 17, was touted as a miracle. But <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON>, who with Stone coordinated both rescues, found the less-publicized search for hunter <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON> more challenging. `` For <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. For Buck, the needle was right in front of you. It was just a matter of reaching in and getting it,'' <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said. `` With Buck, once the medics got there, we knew we'd get him out alive. With <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, we were n't sure if we'd get him out alive.'' <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> had been back from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> for only a day and a half, trying to recover from their exhaustive earthquake efforts, when they received word Tuesday that <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON>, 24, was missing in the <ORGANIZATION> Stanislaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON> became lost after tracking a wounded buck into the woods and got caught by a swift-moving storm that dumped 6 inches of snow over the area. The odds of finding him in the large search area 5,000 feet above sea level were very slim after temperatures had dropped to below freezing, <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fetzer </PERSON>, an experienced hunter and volunteer firefighter, helped himself by hiking to lower elevations away from the storm and found shelter before nightfall each day, said <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON>. He was rescued on Thursday. On the other hand, <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> said he never doubted that the Helm rescue would be successful, even though he was found in what <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON> described as the most unstable part of the freeway. `` Frankly, I felt comfortable with it. I did n't do anything I felt was unsafe,'' said <PERSON> Mendonsa </PERSON>. `` The only think that on occasion would kind of pop up in the back of my mind was an aftershock.''

<HEAD>Bush Warns Against Illegal Transfer of Missile Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday that transfers of forbidden technology are `` taboo'' and `` it would not enhance relations'' if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had defied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> develop an intermediate-range missile. `` It would complicate things, there's no question about that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference winding up a two-day meeting with Western Hemispheric leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not confirm or deny reports that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has assisted the South African missile program in return for a steady supply of uranium. The president said, `` I hope our position is clear in transfer of any military technology that should not be transferred. And if that's taken place, it would not enhance relations between us or any country that does that.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might impose sanctions against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or take other steps, he said, `` You're asking me to accept a hypothesis that I'm not accepting. `` But I have said that whoever it is, the transfer of forbidden technology is taboo. We're not going to have that. And we will find ways to assert that with any country that abuses the system.'' On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> veto power over what <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> can take part in negotiations on elections for the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` We're not trying to throw down a precondition,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` We're just trying, through the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> five points and through giving support to -LRB- <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10 points, to be helpful in getting the talks going,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had agreed to modify his proposed five-point framework for getting the two sides to the table to discuss elections. The state radio gave no details, but said the changes followed almost a week of intensive contacts between <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> over the peace offer. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> had written <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> earlier insisting the plan be modified to drop <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> as the site for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and that exiled Palestinians be barred from participating. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> also demanded that the discussion be limited to discussing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election plan for the occupied territories, not the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' desire for an independent state. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused to confirm or deny the radio report. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday that, `` we want to do everything we can to try and move things forward, and therefore we will review the suggested changes that we have received.'' But he added, `` It would be much better if both sides would accept the five points as a general framework for moving forward.''

<HEAD>Teachers Union Chief Calls For End to `Misleading' Standardized Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teachers union leader <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> called Saturday for an immediate end to multiple-choice standardized achievement testing, saying the results are misleading and may even be hindering school reform. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, made the radical suggestion after a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 50th Invitational Conference in which he said many school districts are apparently shying away from reform ideas for fear they might drag down standardized test scores. `` I would call for an immediate end to standardized tests as they are now,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> told reporters. `` What you need to do is test for things that are really important: reading, writing, computing, history,'' he said. `` To test for depth of knowledge, you have to get away from things that are machine-gradeable.'' He suggested that schools should demand, and publishers produce, new tests that measure ability to perform higher-level academic or intellectual tasks such as writing sensible essays or computing multi-step math problems. Such tests, he said, might resemble the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> exams, congressionally mandated tests taken periodically by thousands of 9 -, 13 -, and 17-year-olds measuring ability to read, write and compute at different levels of Children are being tested far too frequently, <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> added. He suggested that if students were tested at five-year intervals, instead of every year or so, educators might feel freer to innovate to better suit individual student needs. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> stressed that he was not `` anti-test.'' He in fact cautioned against siding with anti-test groups because the public would conclude that school officials were simply trying to escape accountability. But he nonetheless expressed strong agreement with many of the test critics' arguments in his address before 650 educators and testing experts. He cited, for example, a recent study by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> showing that 48 states and some 80 percent of local districts are reporting misleadingly `` above average'' standardized test scores. That phenomenon has come to be called the `` Lake Wobegon Effect'' after the mythical setting of author <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> where, supposedly, `` all children are above average.'' Tests cited by <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> as being misleading include the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Achievement Test, the Stanford Achievement Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Science Research Associates Test, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Test of Basic Skills. But <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> did not extend his call for cessation of multiple-choice standardized testing to the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the college entrance exam taken each year by some 1.6 million high school students. He said the SAT did not have nearly the negative impact of other standardized achievement testing on school curricula. But he said was concerned that the SAT may sometimes act as a learning `` disincentive'' to some students who figure that they do n't have to study hard as long as they do well on the exam. The Educational Testing Service administers the SAT. <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Anrig </PERSON>, in his opening address, agreed that there was an `` overreliance'' on standardized tests in the name of reform. He later told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> was in the midst of revamping the SAT away from the purely multiple-choice format. The new SAT, to be unveiled in 1994, might include essay questions and math problems to be solved without multiple-choice answers. Other conference speakers echoed <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s concerns over the magnified role of testing in the current school reform movement. `` Most current tests are working against the very reforms now required in our educational system,'' said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. Typical standardized tests demand bits of information rather than reasoning. Tests perform the function of `` sorting and gatekeeping,'' but often stop there, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, director of instruction and professional Development at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The result is `` limiting expectations and opportunity rather than expanding them.''

<HEAD>Liquor Store Owner Turns Against Booze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLRAIN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A liquor store owner took a stand against drinking by selling the contents of her shop Saturday in a benefit for charity. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> says she was auctioning off the inventory of her liquor store on the condition that the buyers empty the whiskey, rye and scotch bottles onto the ground. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> decided to close her store in April after hearing a man speak at a church meeting about the number of people killed by drunken drivers. `` It was a real confirmation of what I was feeling. I knew after that I had to go back and close the store,'' she said Thursday. She returned to <PERSON> Streeter </PERSON>'s Package Store, the liquor store she has run for three years and the only one in this western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town, and told a helper to turn off the refrigerator and close up early. `` She thought I had gone off the deep end,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Until then, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> had felt it was her customers' own business if they wanted to drink, even though she stopped drinking alcohol in 1984. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who also has a hair salon, says she will use proceeds from the auction to open a retreat for AIDS patients and their care-givers in southern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> told him how to meditate. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> taught him how to work in a society of fear. Now, journalist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> is tackling the mystery of <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>, who walked into the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> night and never returned. At 85, <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> could bask in the memories of a career spanning such milestones as <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s transatlantic landing in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and World War II. But the author of `` The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' is too busy planning his next projects to think about retirement. `` In a sense a writer never stops. He probably should,'' <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> joked. `` It's awfully difficult to stop, you know, as long as you have your marbles.'' In five years, <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> says, he may give up his daily routine of writing each morning in a <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> house stacked to the ceilings with books, papers and the diaries he used to write most of 15 books. But until then there's a book to be written about why <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> walked out on his wife at age 82, dying a few days later. It's a question that has tantalized <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> for 20 years. `` How could this happen to such a great man?'' he says. The journalist, who proudly shows a visitor his back yard plot glowing with color and says he still likes to sail when his health permits, has lived quietly in the <LOCATION> Berkshires </LOCATION> since a brief second marriage in the 1970s. In 1987, he married again, this time to his 50-year-old Russian teacher, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugovskaya </PERSON>, who is helping him with the Tolstoy research. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> recalled his career, starting in 1925 with a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Coe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` All the students that year were going to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' he recalled. `` America at that time had Prohibition and <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> was in the White House with his inane ideas if any.'' The night before he planned to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> was hired by the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. He was later fired and was again on the brink of returning when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> radio hired him. <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON>'s memoirs of covering <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` The Nightmare Years,'' were recently made into a <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> miniseries of the same name, starring <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> as <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marthe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> as <PERSON> Tess </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON>'s first wife. Part of the nightmare was the dangerous task of getting information about the Third Reich, he said. `` A lot of our work was contacts with the opposition which was n't very much,'' he said. `` We had to get out and get the story from pastors and priests and bishops and people like that.'' And, he says he was n't always successful in convincing American editors about the horrors of the events unfolding in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Shortly before war broke out, he was scheduled to do a feature on a dance festival, but balked at the assignment. `` It was the most horrible taste in the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON>, who covered <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who tried to teach him meditation, provided a great contrast to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. `` It's sort of ironic that in my journalistic career that the two great men that I spent most of my life covering were <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. Both of them genuises, but <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> an evil genius,'' he said. He experienced the German leader's famed charisma firsthand at an art lecture in <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> in 1934. `` It was a gloomy, dank church it was Sunday evening and he was talking about art, about which he knew absolutely nothing except that it was bad and for two hours he spoke without a note and he held this audience absolutely,'' <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> said. By 1940 it was time to get out of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON> went, becoming a radio commentator for CBS.

 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s dalliances with a prostitute got him tossed out of the Assemblies of God in 1988, but several church organizations have closed ranks behind the fallen television evangelist in front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lawyers hope to persuade the nation's highest court Tuesday to overturn rulings that forced the Louisiana-based <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> to pay <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> $ 183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981. They will argue that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tax on Bibles, religious literature, recordings and other items sold by the Ministries violates religious freedom. No other state has such a tax, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s attorneys say. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountability </ORGANIZATION>, Prison Fellowship, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, and other groups have filed briefs on <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s behalf, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> lawyer. `` Churches beyond the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> realize this issue carries broad implications that would chill, if not totally end the dissemination of religious messages, especially across state lines,'' said <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>. `` If the court says you can impose this tax it will have a dramatic effect on all churches,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajalat </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer representing <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` It's a very important First Amendment case. They're talking about taxing Bibles, religious service tapes and religious music. The sales of these items are really people making donations to the ministry.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, however, claims that sales of tangible property are not protected by the Constitution whether they are made by a shop or a church. `` If a Bible is sold in a bookstore, it's taxed. That's the same as if a church sells it. Donations are tax-exempt. They can make all the donations they want, but when they start buying and selling it's another matter,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jugum </PERSON>, assistant chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> sells the Bible, <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON> says, it's different `` A book store is in the business for profit; <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit organization,'' he said. In earlier appeals, which were rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> admitted that some items the ministry sold were subject to the tax, <PERSON> Jugum </PERSON> said. Those items included mugs, bowls, plates, pen and pencil sets, bud vases, Communion cups, candlesticks, replicas of Roman coins, T-shirts bearing the ministry's logo and plastic replicas of the crown of thorns and Ark of the Covenant. `` Where do you draw the line? If you put words from the Bible on a coffee mug is that taxable or is it a symbol of religious freedom? That's the danger here,'' said <PERSON> Jugum </PERSON>. For the years at issue, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> estimate that sales from <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers totaled $ 1.7 million. Sales of merchandise at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> crusades totaled $ 240,000. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has not taxed the ministry since 1982, pending appeal, but if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules against the ministry, it must pay the state taxes based on its sales over the past seven years. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s Baton Rouge-based ministry was once estimated by local officials to be a $ 150 million industry. That changed in February 1988 when <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> confessed to `` moral failure.'' Although <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> never gave specifics, a rival minister said the transgression involved liaisons with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was later defrocked by the Assemblies of God. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry is leaner now _ construction projects at his $ 10 million complex were halted after many television stations stopped carrying his programs _ but it still remains a big industry in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. Ministry officials wo n't discuss specifics but tourism and convention officials said visitors are still drawn to the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> area to attend camp meetings and revivals.

The hostage held longest, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, passed his fifth birthday in captivity Friday. `` While our <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does not approve of this trip of ours. ... they did state that they did not mind us coming and speaking with Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> agreed with much of the peace plan, `` but there's some missing link,'' she said, without elaborating. Thousands of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters met the two representatives at the palace, carrying placards that read: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration supports the Taif conspiracy against free people'' and `` We need support and not intelligence compounds,'' an apparent reference to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy that closed last month. In an address to the throng, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he would not honor presidential elections outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave. `` Any president elected outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be president for those who elected him and any president elected in -LRB- <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> -RRB- occupied <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory will be sa urrogate of theirs, but only the one elected here will become president for all <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that is controlled by his army. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s stance on the elections complicates efforts to arrange for balloting within the period proposed by an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation committee, which is no later than Nov. 7. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not say whether he would reject an election held in the no-man's land of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by neither his troops nor the Syrians and which houses the current <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> also announced that efforts are under way to reopen the American Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We want to return our ambassador and reopen our embassy in this country and that's the first visible step of showing -LRB- our -RRB- commitment,'' said <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pulled Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and 29 other diplomats from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sept. 6 after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of supporting the presence of 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who were deployed in 1976 to quell the civil war. The general has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of selling <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> out of fear for the lives of the Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. After speaking with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the Americans crossed into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where they held talks with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a Moslem Cabinet vying for legitimacy with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> paid special tribute to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who marked his 42nd birthday in captivity Friday. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. `` I want to make a special plea for <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and the others if I can,'' she said. `` We call on anybody that has any influence upon the hostage takers to release them.'' There are a total of 18 Westerners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said Saturday it was prepared to take the `` consequent decisions'' in the case of an Italian who was shot and set on fire in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> during anti-Italian protests. The government called on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to disclose the circumstances of the murder Wednesday of <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceccato </PERSON>, 35. In an interview with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television Friday night, <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said he had not heard about <PERSON> Ceccato </PERSON>'s slaying, which has shocked <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and severely strained relations between the countries. In a further comment that outraged many Italians, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said: `` I hope he had life insurance.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique Saturday saying it preferred not to respond to <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s comments. But it said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> `` would consider it inadmissible for the Libyan side not to shed full light on the very grave incident in view of identifying the culprits.'' The statement urged <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> with `` maximum firmness'' to carry out a swift investigation. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, it said, was ready to `` take the consequent decisions, taking into account the elements and evidence which come to its attention.'' It did not elaborate. Some newspapers suggested the government could order the evacuation of the 3,000 Italians in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and some politicians said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> should recall its ambassador or reduce its diplomatic staff. About 100 people demonstrated outside <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s consulate in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> on Saturday, some throwing eggs or scrawling protests on walls. The demonstration was organized by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s neo-fascist <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which also declared a day of remembrance on Nov. 5 for the Italians who died in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> during the colonial period. <PERSON> Ceccato </PERSON> was slain Wednesday night on the eve of `` day of mourning'' protests declared by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for Libyans deported during 30 years of Italian colonial rule between 1911 and World War II. Italian media reports said <PERSON> Ceccato </PERSON>, who worked for an Italian farm products firm, was found dead near the company's complex just outside <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. He had been shot in the head and stomach and his body set on fire. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, said it appeared to be `` an ordinary criminal crime.'' Pressed about the death, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said foreigners must have been responsible. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitano </PERSON>, met with two <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials Saturday and said they offered their condolences. An Italian policeman flew to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> Saturday to join the investigation along with a doctor who will assist in the autopsy. In the television interview, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> repeated his demand for reparations for the colonial period. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> says it met its obligations with payment of $ 6.7 million under a 1956 agreement with the former Libyan monarchy. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also demanded an explanation from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for its refusal to accept a boatload of 846 Libyans who sailed to <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> without visas to mark the `` day of mourning.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> could retaliate by detaining Italian ships that sail into <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>. The interview appeared to be conducted inside a tent. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, clad in a black leather jacket, sat casually in a swivel chair. His comments were translated from Arabic into Italian by a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> interpreter. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> newspaper called <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s comments `` cynical and impudent.'' <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that the RAI network was flooded by calls from hundreds of viewers angered by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s statements.

 <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>'s parents are not yet ready to look beyond Sunday, which marks a week since their 11-year-old son was snatched at gunpoint by a masked man less than a mile from their home. `` I've been living basically moment by moment since Sunday night,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>. `` I thought by Monday morning this is awful, this is sick,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>, a substitute teacher and <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> president at her son's school. `` This _ day after day _ I ca n't possibly imagine going through the weekend. I ca n't possibly think beyond one minute at a time. I really do n't think.'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, his 10-year-old brother, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON>, and an 11-year-old friend were accosted Sunday night by a man dressed in black on a lonely stretch of road outside this central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town of 2,200, which now display posters of the missing boy along with its Halloween decorations. The abduction occurred about 9:30 p.m. as the three were returning on bicycles and a scooter from a convenience store where they had gone for the first time after dark without an adult. The man, who was on foot and had no vehicle in sight, asked the boys how old they were, then held onto <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and threatened to shoot the other two unless they ran into the woods. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> released a personality profile of the type of person likely to have kidnapped <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, a handsome boy who plays goalie on an ice hockey team. According to the profile, the kidnapper is probably a previous sex offender, a white male 25 to 35 years old with some type of physical deformity, and is likely to work at an unskilled job. State and local police as well as the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have been frustrated by the lack of evidence despite repeated aerial and ground surveys, national publicity, more than $ 100,000 in reward money and appeals to <LOCATION> Stearns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents to scour their property for clues. <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>, 41, said they have n't received any ransom demands and doubts that his work as president of the St. Cloud chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> is a factor in the abduction. Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, who visited the family Thursday, activated 100 <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> to expand the search. The Guardsmen, plus another 100 Department of Natural Resources employees, began searching Saturday at the spot where the sixth-grader was abducted and will fan out through the township, said Lt. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department Horseback patrols and dogs also are being used. At home, a note posted on the kitchen wall by his 8-year-old sister, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, awaits <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s return. It reads, in part: `` You were on the radeo and the News. Evrybuty cry'd very hard. I am glad you are home now.'' `` This family counselor of ours said to me wisely, ` As I see it, you only have one option and that's to know that he's fine and he will be home safe soon.' I just program that into my being,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>. Friends and relatives have been staying around the clock at the two-story frame home in a small wooded subdivision, answering the phone and the door to shield the <ORGANIZATION> Wetterlings </ORGANIZATION> from curiosity-seekers. Most visitors bring gifts of food. `` There's nothing anybody can do so they bring food,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>, 39. `` I'm diabetic and everybody is worried about me eating, but it just wo n't go anywhere,'' she said as she began to cry yet again. `` Right now, we have the luxury of having lots of support people around,'' said <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>, whose chiropractic office was being run last week by a retired chiropractor who normally fills in during vacations. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> wakes up frequently at night and her 13-year-old sister, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, wo n't sleep alone, but the psychological damage extends beyond the Wetterling household. A classmate of <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON>'s, 10-year-old <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, has had problems sleeping since the abduction, said her mother, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>. For a few days after the abduction, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> made her mother accompany her to the bus stop, even though Ms. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> can see it from their home. The Wetterlings believed it was safe for their sons and their friend to travel together at night to the store, and now they do n't know what to tell other parents `` That's the thing the teachers are having a hard time with because they've also taught them to go in a group,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>. `` Now, all of a sudden being in a group was n't enough. I have no advice. We did everything we knew.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, defending his veto of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.4 billion budget, said Saturday he will stand like `` a brick wall'' against any attempt to use public funds for abortions. The White House announced the veto Friday as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived here for the two-day conference on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> leaders on drugs, debt and democracy. The measure would have allowed the nation's capital to use local taxpayers' funds, not federal money, to resume paying for elective and other abortions for poor women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked at a news conference how he justified his action, replied: `` I do n't think public money ought to go for that, except in the life of the mother. ... They can push me for political advantage every time they want to, and they're going to be up against a brick wall.'' `` The people that are being victimized by those kinds of political games are the people in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, conceded Saturday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who won a veto fight in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week over federal money for abortions, has the upper hand on the use of local money for abortions. `` It is not likely that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will be able to override the president's veto any more than it was his veto of the health appropriations,'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The president seems to have all the cards at this point.'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said the district would probably use stopgap appropriations measures to continue city services until a compromise could be engineered on abortion funding. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said after the veto, `` We find it ironic that at the same time the president is vetoing this anti-crime, anti-drug appropriations package, he is in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> ... to celebrate the centennial of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule in that country. Yet, while he is away, we are having dictatorial rule here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> complained that the veto means a delay of at least a month in getting an extra $ 32 million to fight crime. The district has already recorded 364 homicides, eight short of last year's record toll. `` The president has shown his willingness to sacrifice the public safety of the citizens of the nation's capital in order to appeal to a one-issue constituency,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. The budget bill was for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week upheld <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a $ 157 billion appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> that would have allowed Medicaid to pay for abortions nationwide for victims of rape or incest.

 Authorities found 40 bodies of victims of Hindu-Moslem clashes over a northern religious site, journalists and news reports said Saturday. Since Tuesday, 130 people have been killed in violence over the religious dispute, according to news reports. Authorities on Saturday sealed off the northeastern town of <LOCATION> Bhagalpur </LOCATION> to prevent more violence, the reports said. Hindus and Moslems, angered by conflicting claims over the religious site in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, have clashed near <LOCATION> Bhagalpur </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state since Tuesday. Authorities have imposed a curfew and called in army troops to keep order.

Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> news agency quoted officials in <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION> as saying that 18 of the bodies were recovered Saturday, but the agency did not specify where they were found.

 The Nicaraguan Contras, weakened by a Central American peace agreement and reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, may have lost their military and political momentum, but not their determination to overthrow <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s Sandinista government. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s plan to break off a cease-fire with the Contras disrupted <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s celebration of 100 years of democracy and led President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to hint Saturday at the possibility of renewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid for the rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he was ending the 19-month-old cease-fire because of stepped up Contra attacks and accused the U.S.-backed rebels of trying to subvert the electoral process; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> angrily called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` the unwanted animal at the garden party.'' `` Ortega is crying wolf,'' said <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a Contra leader in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who accused the Nicaraguan president of trying to subvert the elections scheduled for Feb. 25. Five Central American presidents agreed Aug. 7 that the Contras should be disbanded in exchange for democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The accord called for the Contras to be voluntarily repatriated to their homeland by Dec. 8. The Contras, in turn, vowed not to disband quietly. They left their home bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and began marching back into their homeland, carrying old weapons and dwindling stocks of ammunition. `` We're sure we'll be able to make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> ca n't live in peace,'' said Contra army commander <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galeano </LOCATION> in a late August interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his headquarters camp in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> said then the rebels would launch no offensive operations and would await the outcome of the elections. `` If the elections are democratic, we'll go back, that's what we're fighting for,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> battalion commander interviewed then. `` But we do n't believe them, that's why we're here.'' Fighting had escalated in the last three weeks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the straw that broke the camel's back was a Contra attack last Sunday that left 19 dead on the last day of registration for the upcoming elections. `` We have n't been launching any attacks. We've only been defending ourselves,'' <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance's directorate, said Saturday. `` They're always attacking us because they want to liquidate us,'' said <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Added <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` It defies any logic that 3,000 men at the most could carry out any military operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said the latest Contra attack occured Friday, when a patrol of army and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops was ambushed in northern <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said the patrol returned fire, killing six Contras. The cease-fire, which took effect shortly after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted military aid to the Contras, was extended on a monthly basis by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The current extension runs out Oct. 31. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meanwhile, kept up non-lethal aid. Scattered fighting continued at a greatly reduced scale, even as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials urged that the Contras to stay in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and not to launch attacks. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Saturday that since the cease-fire was implemented, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> attacks had killed 736 Nicaraguans and injured 1,153 others. He also accused the rebels of kidnapping or causing the disappearance of 1,481 people. With even non-lethal Contra aid due to end in February, Contra officials in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> began to lose control and leadership was taken over by battle-hardened field commanders. When the first Contras began marching into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the beginning of September, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they feared that the powerful Sandinista army would be able to wipe out the isolated and outnumbered Contra groups. The Contras had about 12,000 troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> camps when the accord was signed, and claimed another 6,000 in the interior of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We have too much morale and not enough bullets,'' said <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON>.

 Firefighters and police will get some help this year from some 30,000 volunteers and car telephone owners who will be on the lookout for arson fires set during Devil's Night. A dusk-to-dawn curfew also is in place to guard against the threat of arson during the three-day Devil's Night period that begins Sunday and ends Tuesday on Halloween. In <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a group urged pet owners to lock up their cats until Halloween is over, saying the animals are being mutilated and tortured to death. Several Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> animal shelters also said they will not give away black cats until Halloween is over, fearing the animals may be killed or used as party novelties. In <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, police arrested 20 revelers as hundreds of college students blocked a downtown street early Saturday morning, despite efforts to defuse the annual Halloween street party. Most of the arrests were for alcohol violations and came after about 300 people left a private party and joined a large crowd in the streets, authorities said. The Devil's Night period, named after the nickname for the night before Halloween, traditionally has been a time for pranks in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. But it grew into a bout of arson that peaked in 1984 with 810 fires that killed one person and left dozens homeless. The number of fires in recent years has decreased steadily. There were 229 fires reported during the period last year, an average of 76 per night. About 65 fires are reported on an average night in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, fire officials say. `` I assume if we have the cooperation of the people of this city ... we should be able to keep matters under control,'' Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted for a fifth consecutive year to impose a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew on youths under 18 during the Devil's Night period. More police officers and firefighters will be on duty, and other city workers, mayoral appointees and police cadets will patrol <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> streets to `` serve as additional eyes and ears,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Block club members and citizens band radio owners will comprise many of the estimated 30,000 volunteers expected to assist police in patrol work. The Cellular One telephone service will activate a toll-free number for reporting suspected arson during the three-day period. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will activate a hot line of its own on Sunday. That program offers $ 1,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of an arsonist. City officials also hoped stepped-up demolition of abandoned buildings would present arsonists with fewer potential targets. Nearly 2,000 such buildings have been torn down since July 1.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has agreed to modify <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace proposal to make it more acceptable to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. It said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made the changes following a week of intensive contacts with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment on the radio report. He said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> last week accepting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan in principle but asking for minor changes. Neither the spokesman nor <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> gave details about the purported changes. In other developments: _ Peace activist <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, jailed for meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, told a legislator he had rejected an offer of a pardon if he expressed remorse for meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. _ Masked Palestinians stabbed to death a 42-year-old Palestinian woman suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. _ Israeli troops opened fire during clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, killing one Palestinian and wounding 15. At least 606 Arabs have been killed during the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occpuation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Another 137 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. Forty Israelis also have perished in the violence. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, in his letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan be changed to drop <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, as the site for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks and to bar Palestinians deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from participating in the negotiations. He also insisted that the talks be limited to discussing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election plan for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and not include <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for an independent state. The Israeli plan calls for elections and limited autonomy in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposed an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to discuss the election offer and specified that the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation could discuss other political issues. He also did not rule out the participation of Palestinians expelled from their homeland by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Israeli Cabinet has rejected a suggestion by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates meet in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with the Palestinian members to include two deportees with links to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Peace crusader <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> was convicted Sept. 27 of meeting with <PERSON> Afafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in September 1988 and was sentenced to six months in prison. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s anti-terror law prohibits meetings with members of terrorist organizations, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> such a group <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> entered the Eyal prison near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> three weeks ago to begin serving the sentence. Legislator <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> visited <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saturday </PERSON> and said later that officials had offered to arrange a pardon. `` They let it be known that if he will express regret for meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and if he promises not to do it again, he will be granted a pardon,'' <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He reported <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said he told the officials, who he did not identify, that the offer was `` totally unacceptable.'' `` He has no regrets about what he has done,'' <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Etti </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON> said the ministry has not considered asking President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> to pardon <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> `` and I do n't know where this allegation is coming from.'' Arab reporters said that in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> five masked youths entered the house of <PERSON> Rasmiyya </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON> and slashed her face and neck with knives and pieces of broken glass.

<HEAD>Court Rules Strikers Violated Law, But Walkout Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A regional court ruled that striking coal miners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> were violating a new labor law, but their walkout continued, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The case indicated that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s increasingly frequent labor disputes are now to be settled by legal means. Until recently, workers could expect strikes to be broken up by tough police action and leaders could expect long jail sentences. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> autonomous region ruled that strikers at the <LOCATION> Vargashor </LOCATION> mine in the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> region north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> had `` grossly violated'' a law passed Oct. 9 by the national Supreme Soviet parliament. The miners walked off the job Wednesday to protest what they said was the government's failure to follow through on promises of improved economic and social conditions that ended a major walkout in July. The Vargashor mine is the largest of nine mines in the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> region with a total of 18,000 workers. The court decision involved a suit filed by managment. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say when the court ruled. The news agency said the court found the coal miners violated provisions of the new law that requires conciliation and arbitration commissions to be set up before a strike. It said they also violated a provision requiring that a strike be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the workers. However, there was no immediate indication that miners would end their strike, or what kind of penalties the court might impose. Under the law, those held responsible can be forced to compensate for business losses. Strikes at other coal mines in the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> region collapsed Thursday when management took the issue to court. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned Thursday that `` strong administrative measures through the prosecutor and the courts'' could be taken to end the strike and promote stability. Soviet officials have expressed worry there will be shortages of coal for producing fuel and electricity this winter because of this year's series of walkouts. The region's coal production is only about half of its targeted level, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the region is 55,000 tons behind for October.

<HEAD>Report Claims Pan Am Bomb Planted in Malta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police have found evidence the bomb that brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and killed 270 people was planted in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper said the evidence was found in a computer list of all luggage put aboard the flight when it originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21. The Passengers and luggage later were transferred to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. All 259 people aboard the airplane and 11 residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, were killed when the plane exploded and crashed. The Sunday Times, citing British sources, said the baggage list showed that one suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 from an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> plane, flight KM180. That flight originated in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> the morning of Dec. 21. No passenger accompanied the bag onto the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight, the newspaper said. Late Saturday night, the police press office in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> issued the following statement by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the Scottish detective heading the investigation: `` As part of the ongoing international investigation, officers from the inquiry team at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> have traveled to many different countries including <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Clearly, it would be imprudent for me to comment on the significance of any of these inquiries while the investigation is still active.'' The Sunday Times quoted <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Grech </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION>, as confirming last week that Scottish police had interviewed a senior executive of the airline. The newspaper said 20 airport workers also were interviewed. No one has been charged in the bombing. Press reports have cast suspicion on several terrorist groups, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. The Scottish detectives who are heading the investigation have contended for several months that the bomb was put aboard Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. They have said the bomb was packed into a radio-cassette player. The Sunday Times, however, said the bomb was placed in a copper-colored suitcase. It said forensic experts at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION> believe the suitcase contained clothing manufactured and purchased in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The Sunday Times said a pair of trousers in the suitcase was traced to a shop in the Maltese tourist resort of <LOCATION> Sliema </LOCATION>. It said police interviewed the shopkeeper, who recalled selling the trousers and other items in the suitcase to a man he believed was a Libyan.

 More than 2,000 people led by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> prayed Saturday at a funeral Mass for thousands of prisoners secretly executed in the Stalinist era and buried in unmarked graves throughout <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. After more than 40 years, it was believed to be the first public funeral for the untold numbers executed during the early years of the Communist takeover in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The crimes were long cloaked in silence, with families fearful to even speak about the victims. A changed official attitude, however, was underscored at Saturday's ceremony by the presence by two ministers from the new government led by non-Communist Solidarity members. Also attending were widows and children of victims and former Stalinist-era prisoners. No officials from the Communist Party were seen. Historian <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, speaking during a symbolic burial ceremony after the Mass, referred to the victims as `` those who made the sacrifice of their life in the service of their homeland.'' The victims included officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the main underground resistance force during the wartime <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation, and other suspected opponents of the Communist takeover. In his sermon, <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, wearing violet funeral vestments, condemned the `` terrifying evil that raged, unmindful of any violation of morality, capable of the utmost contempt of humanity.'' The Roman Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> called for full disclosure of Stalinist crimes. The ceremony was held at the 750-year-old parish of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s on the southern edge of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, just a few hundred yards from <LOCATION> Walbrzyska </LOCATION> Street Cemetery. Many of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> victims are said to have been secretly buried there at night during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Former underground army fighters and members of the recently legalized Union of Former Prisoners from the Stalinist Time formed an honor guard inside the packed church. Much of the crowd spilled over into the yard outside. After Mass, an urn filled with earth from the <LOCATION> Walbrzyska </LOCATION> cemetery and three other suspected burial sites was laid in a small stone-lined grave next to the church steps. Among those watching was <PERSON> Bernart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, who served as an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during World War II after the occupation of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. For that reason, he was sentenced by the newly installed Communist regime to 10 years in prison as an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy when he returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said. He was sent to Mokotowski Prison, now notorious for its brutality to political prisoners. `` They would come in the night and take people out of their cells,'' he said. `` No one ever heard from them again.''

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Looking Worldwide for Bank Havens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Efforts to curb money laundering in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> have pushed drug traffickers to scour the globe for banking havens for their illicit profits, bankers and economists said Saturday. Countries whose economies thrive due to banking secrecy laws may want to join the war on drugs, but few are willing to clean up other black-market activities, said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. `` Drug money is mixed with money from arms trafficking, smuggling, insider trading and the looting of underdeveloped countries,'' <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> told bankers, lawyers and law enforcement officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at the conference on money laundering being held in this <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> suburb. `` The Indian Ocean seems to be the new frontier,'' <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- The -RRB- <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> are getting into the offshore and instant-corporation game ... and dope dealers are moving in under the cover of that.'' In his keynote speech Friday, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws making money laundering a crime, requiring banks and corporations to report large cash transactions and treaties allowing authorities to exchange information across borders have immeasurably helped efforts to seize the profits of the drug cartels. Nevertheless, drug traffickers are `` diabolically innovative'' at hiding their money, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` They will employ any financial instrument as a cleanser.'' Many academics, lawyers and bankers said they were even more pessimistic. Curtailing money laundering will never be as successful as interdicting the flow of drugs because it is n't feasible to restrict international financial markets, said economist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seized about 90 metric tons of cocaine last year, about one-fourth the estimated 360 to 450 tons that reached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> users. In contrast, the more than 6 million cash-transaction reports submitted so far this year have uncovered only several dozen laundering leads, <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These are hard-core desparadoes. To think that additional money laundering controls in the banking system will exert a chilling effect is simply unrealistic,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisotsky </PERSON>, a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Nova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wisotsky </PERSON> advocated cutting the drug enforcement budget and putting more taxpayer money into social programs. That comment drew an angry reaction from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office, who pointed to the conference as evidence of the international cooperation needed to fight drug trafficking. `` Ten years ago, no such thing as money laundering was a crime,'' he said later. `` Now, you no longer see one to two million dollars in loads of cash going into banks.'' But <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadelmann </PERSON>, a political-science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who endorses legalizing drugs, said the government was misdirecting its resources. `` The current drug policy is a social, moral, economic, and political disaster,'' <PERSON> Nadelmann </PERSON> said. `` We should treat it as a public health issue. Let's stop screwing around and thinking we can win this war.''

<HEAD>Former President Calls for Pacific Free Trade Zone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSAKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday that Americans may lose patience with what they consider unfair Japanese trade barriers, and he urged creation of a Pacific free trade zone. The remarks, on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last day of a nine-day visit, were in contrast to earlier speeches made during the trip, in which he glossed over trade disputes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, left this western port city at 4 p.m. for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with about 230 kin of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> aboard their chartered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. The plane arrived in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at about 1 p.m. EDT, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>. He said the former president and his wife made no remarks at the airport, but went directly to their limousine for a ride to their <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home. Before their departure, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a gathering of 420 prominent businessmen that many Americans do not feel their products have fair access to Japanese markets. `` Fairness is a very strong strain in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said, recalling the unfairness that provoked the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1773 leading up to the American Revolution. `` We do n't want a Japanese tea party,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> posted a $ 52 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. Even more damaging than actual trade barriers, he said, is a communications gap in which `` Americans think <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a nation of trade barriers.'' In turn, `` The <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a nation that makes products that nobody wants to buy.'' Until trade barriers of any kind are lowered, `` the focus in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not going to be on whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies have the quality products Japanese consumers want to buy, but that the Japanese system wo n't let the Japanese consumers buy them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll that showed 68 percent of Americans surveyed believe <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic power is a greater threat to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> future than Soviet military might. But he said few Americans realize trade barriers account for no more than 20 percent of the trade deficit and even fewer are aware of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade barriers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged both countries to overcome their disagreements on trade, `` put this step-by-step bickering we're going through behind us and embrace a trade vision that is encompassing.'' His dream, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, was of a free trade arrangement similar to the North American trade zone the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have agreed to establish. That agreement will eliminate trade barriers between the two nations over the next decade. `` We are the two greatest economic powers in the world,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Let us leap beyond our no-win squabbling by undertaking a breathtaking plan ... a free trade zone between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Oct. 20 as guests of the Japanese government and <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest media organization The hosts spent $ 7 million on the visit. There have been reports that Fujisankei paid <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> $ 2 million for his appearances on television and at charitable events. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the company refused comment on the reports. Fujisankei's media outlets are known to favor conservative, nationalistic views, and company chairman <PERSON> Nobutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikanai </PERSON> has been a strong supporter of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Company officials have said they viewed his visit as an opportunity to improve <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 This sun-blessed land struts to the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, a real-life Shangri-la of precious resources, opportunity, space, bounty, beauty and unabashed individualism. But paradise has a trap door. Below its surface are plates of earth that slip and slide past each other with enough occasional fury to move mountains, flatten freeways and put lives and lifestyles in peril. The Oct. 17 quake jolted the fickle existence of Northern Californians who inhabit a world so ideal that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> called it `` life on the half shell.'' `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has always represented the dream of a better life, more sunshine, more space, a perfect home. But it's also the center of tragedy: fires, earthquakes, mudslides, all kinds of disasters,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> historian and a fourth-generation Californian. `` To be a Californian now is not to be an escapist, but it's to be a high-risk person.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was named the nation's second-most livable city by Rand-McNally just a week after it got its most potent jolt since 1906. It is synonymous with earthquakes the way <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, is with floods. It's another stereotype. But Californians endure them the same way they endure Easterners and rain, as a nuisance. <LOCATION> Blissful </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the land of the laid-back, tofu, self-awareness, yoga, hedonism, narcissism, wheat grass juice, kooks, nutballs and weird religions. `` The rest of the country thinks we all sit around in hot tubs with glasses of white wine and grow organic gardens, and we do, but so what,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a waiter at Coffee <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>'s. A waitress there swears her friend sprained his wrist while skateboarding in an earthquake fissure. There was no underestimating the tragedy of the earthquake. It killed 64 people. It sent 3,300 to hospitals and forced nearly 14,000 from their homes. `` Earthquakes are something we live with here,'' said real estate agent <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. And quake response in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was, well, uniquely Californian. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s Quiches of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> donated 20,000 quiches to the relief effort. Someone else gave hibachis for cooking. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> sent 200 massage therapists to knead the aching, stressed muscles of rescue workers. <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a British company that makes hot tubs, sent a $ 1 million check to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to help victims of the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo. Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> donated 2,500 pounds of coffee beans to relief agencies in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollister </LOCATION>. A city porn shop offered an `` earthquake special'' of vibrating sex toys. The quake interrupted baseball's premier event, the World Series, pitting the cross-bay rival <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>. Sports prowess is another part of the elan of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, also home to the Super Bowl champion 49ers. One entrepreneur, stuck with stacks of `` Battle of the Bay'' T-shirts printed a giant R over the B and came up with `` Rattle of the Bay.'' Another shirt read: `` I Went to Candlestick Park for the World Series and All I Got Was This Lousy Earthquake.'' A bumper sticker read: `` Stop Continental Drift.'' The temblor was centered 56 miles south of the city under a remote peak of <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, or <PERSON> Dark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. It registered 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale but did n't reach the force of The Big One, a quake of apocalyptic proportions that experts warn is coming. Smug Californians called this one The Pretty Big One. An earthquake simulator, one of the hottest attractions on the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> tour, suspended operations for 48 hours after the quake as a sympathy gesture. `` The Big One'' is set in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> transit station. `` We equated closing it down to flying the flag at half staff,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullard </PERSON>. It is the studio's most popular attraction. The quake knocked out bridges and freeways, forcing record use of public transit _ no easy trick for Californians who are so wedded to their cars that a hearse driver once tried in vain to claim the body in his coffin as a passenger so he could use the car pool lane. `` This is going to be a lifestyle change for us,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Some motorists used ferries that normally carry tourists to <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. On Monday, gale force winds created enough waves to cause sea-sickness. `` I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made it through,'' said an ashen-faced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> had this to say about lifestyles: `` People began to talk of lifestyle changes, as if the earthquakes had suddenly come into fashion and we had nothing in our wardrobe that matched.'' The quake smashed elegant homes in the city's <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district and drove the permanently homeless from the seedy Tenderloin deeper into their shadowy world. The Moscone Convention Center was used as an emergency center but was cleared out to make room for a pre-scheduled meeting of plastic surgeons. `` The earthquake had no priority list. There's a common jolt that hit us all, every race, every class. It made us all feel finite,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Glide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. This is the city where <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Doda </PERSON> jiggled in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first topless bar in 1964, where licentious hippies flourished in <LOCATION> Haight-Asbury </LOCATION> in the tie-dyed Sixties and where homosexuals came out of the closet in the Seventies. Evangelist <PERSON> Virgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> weaved those threads into the fabric of the quake as she preached this week through a bullhorn at <LOCATION> Halladie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, the city's version of Times Square. `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said he would send earthquakes to Godless places. This city's wicked, like Sodom and Gomorrah, where men love men more than they love God,'' she railed on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> and Christ. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Sisters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perpetual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indulgence </ORGANIZATION>, a band of gay men who dress in miniskirted nuns' habits and fishnet stockings, will aid earthquake victims by holding benefit dances. `` We're sort of icons. We're as much a symbol of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> as earthquakes,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON>, also known as Sister Vicious. `` When people call <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> kooky and weird, they're reacting to our wide-open freedom.'' Two days after the quake, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> lectured reporters huddled near ruins in the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> and told them to write about the majority of the city that was n't damaged. `` We're not a city of kooks,'' she shouted to no one in particular. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is going to live through this. We're not something that falls apart We are survivors.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher's Popularity Plummets After Cabinet Shake-up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of British voters thinks Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should step down as <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, according to a poll published in Sunday's editions of The Mail. Another poll, published in The Sunday Telegraph, found that 47 percent of all voters, and 24 percent of Conservatives, thought less of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> following the resignation last week of Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. The polls represented Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s lowest popularity rating in 10 years in power. They also were the first gauge of public reaction to <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s resignation because of a disagreement with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her personal economic adviser over monetary policy. His resignation forced the second reshuffle of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Cabinet in three months The Mail's poll, based on interviews with 1,043 voters on Saturday, found that 54 percent believed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should step down. The newspaper did not break out the percentage of Conservatives who want Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to resign. The poll's margin of error was not disclosed, nor was the method of interviewing. The Sunday Telegraph's Gallup Poll of 505 voters, conducted by telephone on Friday and Saturday, found that 47 percent felt less respect for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> following the Cabinet shake-up, while 49 percent said their opinion was unchanged. Among Conservatives, 70 percent said their opinion was unchanged, while 24 percent said they had less respect. The poll's margin of error was not disclosed. Eight-two percent of all voters and 69 percent of Conservatives believed <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s departure had reinforced Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s reputation as sometimes being `` bossy and dictatorial.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Luella </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> enjoyed the kind of retirement lifestyle most people dream about until a precedent-setting liability case two years ago claimed everything she had. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 91, had paid for her house, traveled south every winter and had more than $ 500,000 in the bank, money she often shared with family and friends. `` I always thought money was to spend, on myself and on others,'' she said recently. `` That's what I worked for.'' But her generosity led to her legal woes. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> lent a grand-nephew money to buy a car. Three weeks later, after a night of drinking and using drugs, he was in an automobile accident in which a passenger lost a leg. The passenger successfully sued <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, saying she knew her grand-nephew did not have a driver's license and that he used drugs, and therefore was negligent in lending him money to buy a car. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> now lives like a recluse, eats lunch courtesy of Meals on Wheels and owes $ 950,000 to a young man with criminal convictions. Her one small hope is a retrial scheduled for Nov. 6 in <ORGANIZATION> Bennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Last spring, the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the decision against <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> but also ruled that the auto dealer who sold the car to the grand-nephew should not have been excluded from the case. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said she feels like a victim of a legal system gone awry. `` I do n't know how all this ever happened to me _ it could n't have happened 50 years ago,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Rutland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in an interview last week. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who did not testify in the 1987 trial because of a medical problem, said of the retrial, `` If I can walk, I'll be there. I should have told my story to the jury last time.'' According to testimony at the first trial, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s grand-nephew <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> was driving a 1981 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> on April 24, 1984, when he picked up three friends. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> testified that he drank nearly a gallon of beer, had at least one shot of whiskey and shared at least six marijuana cigarettes with the others. Sometime after 11 p.m., <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s car went off a railroad bridge. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>, who was riding in the back seat, was paralyzed from the middle of his back down and later had a leg amputated. <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>, unemployed with 18 misdemeanor convictions before the accident, had not known <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> before the night of the accident and did not know he had no driver's license. <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>'s attorney successfully sued <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> by arguing that she knew <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> did not have a license and that he drank and used drugs. After deliberating for an hour, the jury agreed. `` I think it's just really stretching to hold a grandmother responsible because she either lends or gives money to a great-nephew to buy a car,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrich </PERSON>. The plaintiff's attorney, <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternberg </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s claims of poverty are exaggerated. `` She is not destitute,'' <PERSON> Sternberg </PERSON> said. `` The court order said her assets are to be frozen except for what she needs to live adequately. Somebody is trying to make it difficult to pick a fair and impartial jury.'' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> McVie </PERSON>, a juror in the 1987 trial, said the case had been difficult. `` We saw and heard <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> in his wheelchair, and we felt terrible for him,'' she said. `` We were n't told about his record, and we were told by his lawyers that he was going to school and had straightened out his life. `` I guess in our hearts we were afraid it could turn out like this, but we never saw her and we did n't know if she had insurance or not.'' When <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s insurance company refused to pay the $ 950,000 judgment against her, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> attached all her assets, including her $ 102,000 home. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has sued her insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>. `` If this ruling as allowed to stand, I feel sorry for any other older people loaning relatives money,'' she said. `` They'll have to watch out or they'll be sued by someone they never met.''

<TEXT>
 A group of Japanese-Americans who were denied their high school diplomas seven months after <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> won recognition 47 years later in a graduation ceremony at their alma mater Saturday. Wearing blue mortarboards and graduation gowns, 11 of the 15 former students who were snubbed in wartime assembled at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> High School to receive their diplomas, which were dated June 26, 1942. `` Our purpose today is to redress this very serious grievance that occurred in 1942,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>. The ceremony included the pledge of allegiance. Graduate <PERSON> Aiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshinaga </PERSON> said she blamed the government, not her school, for the insult. `` I think the government's action was based on racism,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Yoshinaga </PERSON>, mother-in-law of current school board member <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Furutani </PERSON>. `` Not only racism, but really a lack of honesty, a lack of real strong political leadership,'' she added. `` So I have warm feelings about the high school I went to.'' The wartime graduation was held not at the high school but in suburban <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anita </LOCATION> racetrack, which had been converted in 1942 to a temporary holding pen for Japanese-Americans. An estimated 120,000 Japanese-Americans were taken from their <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> homes and detained in camps during the war. Hundreds of students received their diplomas at the racetrack ceremony, but the 15 students from <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> waited in vain to hear their names called. They blame the tide of anti-Japanese sentiment that swept the nation after the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, which brought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into the war. The students said that sentiment was personified in <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, the wartime principal at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> High. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who died in 1982, refused to issue the students' diplomas even though the school board declared all <PERSON> Japanese-American </PERSON> seniors in good standing be given diplomas. <PERSON> Furutani </PERSON> was contacted about the diplomas by another member of Mrs. <PERSON> Yoshinaga </PERSON>'s class, <PERSON> Hayao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Furutani </PERSON> had district employees search old school records to document <PERSON> Shishino </PERSON>'s claims. `` It was time to set the record straight,'' <PERSON> Furutani </PERSON> said this week. `` We decided it was time they have their real diplomas.'' One of the original 15 has died and three others could not attend the ceremony, <PERSON> Shishino </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to begin making $ 1.2 billion in reparation payments next year to Japanese-Americans confined to camps during World War II. The bill, which would give $ 20,000 to each of the 60,000 surviving internees, now moves to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, angered by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s threat to resume fighting with the Contras, derided the Nicaraguan president on Saturday as a `` little man'' and an `` unwanted animal at a garden party.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, a bit more diplomatic, responded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was just reacting defensively. What triggered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s temper was <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s surprise announcement Friday _ between meetings at the summit of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> leaders _ that he would break off the cease-fire with <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels that has been in place since March 1988. At a news conference Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mocked <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision to wear a military uniform to a meeting of democratic leaders. He called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> an `` outcast'' and an `` unwanted animal at a garden party.'' He said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had embarrassed himself in front of the hemisphere's leaders. `` I do know that President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> got a hold of him last night and spoke very directly to him,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, adding that two other presidents did as well. Just hours before declaring his intention to end the cease-fire, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> shook hands with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a brief encounter. The Nicaraguans eagerly released photos of the two presidents together; the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> withheld its shots. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday that instead of `` seeking a photo opportunity,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> should be talking to the U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas, `` to his own people.'' Twice he referred to the 5-foot-10 Nicaraguan as a `` little man.'' Asked why he used that description, the 6-foot-2 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> snapped, `` Because he is, that's why.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, upon returning to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, responded: `` This is a totally defensive attitude on the part of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' His spokeswoman, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, quoted <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as saying: `` The tone of the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- statements was not in harmony with the spirit of the summit.'' `` Little man'' may not have been the best phrase for an American president to use in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is often portrayed as a tall, blue-eyed devil taking advantage of short, brown Indians. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is actually tall for a Central American. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, their mutual host, is closer to average at 5-foot-6. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said nothing publicly about the contretemps, but his spokesman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had insulted `` all the democraticlaly elected presidents of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.''

 Opposition leaders on Saturday denounced President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s talk of ending a cease-fire with U.S.-backed rebels amid reports that government troops were massing, possibly for new fighting. However, the president returned home Saturday from a regional summit saying President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had shown interest in enlisting the help of other Latin American presidents to change <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision to end the 19-month-old truce. `` I interpret this as a predisposition of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, amid all his rhetoric, of negotiating this matter of the truce with the mediation'' of Latin American presidents, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. Opposition leaders said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s announcement he would end the truce was designed to disrupt national elections that the government fears it will lose. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the cancellation of the cease-fire `` places the electoral process under a state of siege.'' He spoke to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> radio station, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, where the summit was held. He called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s plan `` a maneuver to intimidate the population.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced Friday in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> that his leftist Sandinista government will end the cease-fire with the Contra rebels, but he did not say when. He stepped back slightly from that announcement after arriving in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> Saturday. He said his government will announce Tuesday whether it will extend the truce with the Contras for another month. However, he said he would continue observing the truce only if non-lethal American aid to the Contras were used to disband the rebel force. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Friday the cease-fire could not hold because of stepped up attacks by rebels, a claim denied by Contra leaders. `` The drop of water that made the glass spill over'' was an attack Oct. 21 in which 19 soldiers died, he told an audience at the University of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Government troops were reportedly being moved to strategic points in what could be preparations for new military operations. A government-run radio station in central Chontales province said Saturday that more than 1,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> were being transported to guard the strategically important <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> Road </PERSON>. The station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catarran </ORGANIZATION>, cited unidentified military sources as saying the move was `` because of the constant activity of the Contras'' along the road. Sources in Chontales said there has been heavy helicopter traffic in the area around <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, over the past few days. There was speculation that government troops and equipment were being moved in that manner. For 19 months, the government had been extending the truce, usually at the beginning of every month. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he had spoken with presidents <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> at the summit and that they told him they were willing to mediate between <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the truce. Interviewed live by government-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio after stepping off an airplane on his return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> denied reports he had stormed out of the two-day summit. He said he left early simply to attend to matters in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> dismissed a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comment calling him a `` little man,'' saying: `` This is a totally defensive attitude on the part of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said in a telephone interview in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that the Contras were not responsible for the Oct. 21 ambush. `` Ortega is crying wolf,'' he said. `` Behind this ploy we can see that he wants to disrupt the electoral process because of <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s increasing popularity and support.'' <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> of the coalition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s main challenger in the Feb. 25 election. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> chief spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said rebels have neither the weapons nor manpower to mount offensives. `` It defies any logic that 3,000 men at the most could carry out any military operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said most Contras remained in camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of raising the allegation to justify a final offensive against the Contras. Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday that truce violations by the Contras have left 736 people dead and 634 wounded in the past 19 months. Also Saturday, an army spokesman denied the government had staged mock combat in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to keep people from registering to vote. Lt. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, an army spokesman, said a patrol of army and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops was ambushed Friday in northern <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> province and returned fire, killing six Contras. The Contras denied staging any offensive inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> military leader, said the Sandinista army had been conducting a cleanup operation in the area against the guerrillas, `` who have to defend themselves.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> on Saturday promised to punish inmates who took part in two nights of fiery, bloody rioting at a state prison outside this city and to move quickly to relieve <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s overcrowded prisons. Hours after the siege ended Friday, a caravan of buses left the prison under heavy <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> guard, taking 507 of its 2,600 inmates to four other state penitentiaries already swelled beyond capacity, officials said. Hundreds more were expected to be moved to another state prison and a new 800-cell federal penitentiary in northwest <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Officials also worked to get hundreds of inmates who spent Friday night outdoors in two exercise yards back into damaged cellblocks, <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The cells will be searched first, then locked and chained when prisoners are returned, he said. And in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, about 120 inmates at the city's <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> prison took over a cellblock for nearly five hours Saturday, barricading the entrances with bed frames and setting matresses on fire following an argument with a guard, said city prison Lt. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. No hostages were taken and the cellblock was retaken around 8:30 p.m., <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The two-night uprising at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, left at least 133 people injured and almost half of the prison's buildings destroyed or damaged by fire Five hostages were released Friday morning after state police stormed the prison, restoring order after a building-by-building assault. No inmates escaped, officials said. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> met for several hours Saturday with Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, State Police Commissioner <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> and other top officials. The governor said officials still know little about what triggered the two days of violence, or how inmates were able to free themselves Thursday after guards had regained control of the prison following the first night's riot. `` We must identify and punish those inmates whose criminal acts destroyed property and put innocent lives in danger,'' he said. `` We must promptly craft a plan to replace lost prison-cell capacity at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and provide additional cell space throughout our state correctional system on as fast a track as possible.'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said he would appoint an independent commission to study the cause of the disturbance and recommends ways to improve ease prison overcrowding. He also said he would review the need for more corrections officers. The violence began Wednesday after a prisoner attacked a prison worker, leading to a seven-hour rampage. Officials regained control of the prison. But by Thursday evening inmates managed to free themselves again, and began a second night of rioting. Most of the injured were showing improvement in hospitals, officials said. A 24-year-old prisoner with a gunshot wound to the abdomen and a 41-year-old guard with multiple stab wounds to the back were in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said. Both had been in serious condition Friday. An 18-year-old inmate was in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the upper torso at <ORGANIZATION> Polyclinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. A 25-year-old guard who suffered a head injury and smoke inhalation and a prisoner with a gunshot wound to the leg were in fair condition at <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wege </PERSON> said. The hospital released two guards and three inmates Saturday, she said. Three inmates and a guard were in satisfactory condition at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Diann </PERSON> <PERSON> Esser </PERSON>. The guard suffered bruises on his back and throat. One prisoner had a gunshot wound, another had been stabbed in the back and a third had chest pain, the supervisor said.

 A birthday party in a neighborhood hall erupted into a gunbattle early Saturday that left 15 people wounded, one critically, police said.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, rudely interrupted in his cruise to City Hall, faced an array of television cameras a week ago and uttered six awful words for a politician to speak: `` I have not done anything wrong.'' Strategically, at least, he had. Besieged by questions about a stock sale to his son, the Democratic front-runner for mayor found himself forced into a complicated defense. By early last week, he had plummeted in the polls. Happily for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> did not pull past him. After six weeks of sharply negative campaigning, the 45-year-old former federal prosecutor was ill-positioned to grab <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> defectors. Still, the mayoral race, with the outcome once seemingly set in stone, is suddenly uncertain. With just 1 -LCB- weeks to go, the duel to lead the nation's most populous city is startlingly uncertain _ and increasingly contentious. `` It's one of the great races of guys running backwards that I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, political adviser to Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> upended in the Democratic primary Sept. 12. `` <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> hurt himself very badly'' in a series of early missteps that raised charges of racial insensitivity, said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, and `` <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' problem is definitely <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. The question is, who's going to lose it first?'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> in Sunday's editions, saying he is more experienced in city government than <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and could help ease racial tensions in the city. But the Times editorial bemoaned what it called a `` sorry'' campaign. `` Neither man has demonstrated compelling qualifications for the job <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has filled for half a generation,'' the newspaper said. In a city that has five registered Democrats for every Republican, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the 62-year-old <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, has a built-in edge in his quest to become <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s first black mayor. He enjoys the support of most unions, whose field work in turning out voters can be invaluable on Election Day. But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is wounded, his lead perhaps cut in half from the 20-point cushion he had enjoyed all fall. One reason is his struggle to explain why he sold his son stock in a privately held communications company for $ 58,000 when less than three years before he listed its worth as $ 1 million. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the higher sum was an overstatement and he produced documents supporting the lower price. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> undervalued the stock to avoid gift taxes and accused him of `` knowingly and intentionally'' breaking the ethics law. The Republican used the issue to remind voters of <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' failure to file tax returns from 1969 to 1972. Despite the comfortable margin in the polls, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has been on the defensive since primary night, when he let his friend <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> address a victory party _ a tactical error, analysts say, because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support of Palestinian rights and his onetime reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' have made him anathema to some Jewish voters. While <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> himself has a strong pro-Israel record, his troubles were compounded by charges that one of his advisers made anti-Semitic remarks years ago and that his campaign paid $ 9,500 for work by a black nationalist who is a convicted kidnapper. Some strategists think <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> would not have held a 20-point lead in any case. `` The man's a black candidate. That's an inherent liability in some communities,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, political adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, which backs <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' one salvation has been <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s own woes. Critics suggested <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> was playing to racial and ethnic divisions when he placed an ad in a Yiddish newspaper showing himself with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Let the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> choose their own destiny,'' it said. Then there was the <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> flap: The comedian, serving as <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s emissary to Jewish voters, created a furor by suggesting that Jews favored <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> out of guilt and by calling <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> a `` fancy shvartze with a mustache.'' Shvartze is a derogatory Yiddish term for blacks. For all their differences in image, the candidates share positions on many issues. In separate appearances before a group of rabbis last week, they made strikingly similar points, calling for more police patrols, more housing for the homeless, better drug education and treatment on demand for addicts. There are substantive differences: <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has suggested a 1 percent, nearly across-the-board budget cut to handle a looming deficit crisis, while <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> wants more selective cuts. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> backs building a trash incinerator in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> wants more study. If the race is <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' to lose, political analysts said, another misstep could be fatal. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is like the stock market right now,'' said <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>. `` He took a long fall. He leveled off and bounced up a little. And he may or may not fall more, depending on what comes up.''

 Catholics and Protestants took two `` peace trains'' Saturday to protest an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing campaign against the <LOCATION> Dublin-Belfast </LOCATION> rail link, but a bomb threat stopped one of the trains. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has disrupted service on the rail line more than 60 times in the past year with bombs and bomb threats, had promised to let the day pass peacefully. `` People right across the community are making a point and the point is this _ that this railway link between north and south must be kept open. It is vital to our island,'' said Bishop <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Poyntz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. He saw the train riders off in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, the capital of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Cahal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was also at the station as the trains left for <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, each with about 400 riders aboard. Hundreds more were turned away for lack of seats. `` This is a message the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> can not refuse to hear, because it is coming from working and middle-class people, young and old, who are not going to allow communication in this island to be stopped,'' <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. The two trains went to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and back to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> without incident. However, when one of them set off again from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> with new passengers later Saturday, it was halted before reaching the border because of an anonymous telephone warning of a bomb on the line on the Republic side. Inspector <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of the Republic's police, whose force received and relayed the warning, said it could not investigate until daylight. The 70 people aboard, including <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> legislators, decided to stay on the train through the night at <LOCATION> Portadown </LOCATION>, 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. In a statement reported Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it would `` resume occasional attacks when we see fit. `` These attacks are not aimed at closing it down but to force British soldiers into painstaking and dangerous operations,'' said the statement. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite the Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. No one has been killed or seriously injured in the campaign against the railroad line, and the major impact has been to depress business on what, until recently, was the only public transport link between the two capitals. The rail line now has competition from a daily bus service. When the two special trains pulled into <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s Connolly Station, they were greeted by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> playing `` Congratulations.'' The only protest came at the border station of <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> where supporters of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, carried banners calling for British withdrawal from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` The ` peace train' concept has brought together people of different political opinions from all walks of life, north and south,'' said <PERSON> Proinsias </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossa </PERSON>, a passenger on the train and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which broke away from <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> 20 years ago. `` I am sure the vast majority would also be prepared to support a more general demand for peace and an end to the killing and destruction,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossa </PERSON>, whose group has rejected armed struggle as a means of uniting the two Irelands.

 An unruly crowd of hundreds chanted `` burn, baby, burn'' as a group of radical <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans torched a pile of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags Saturday, minutes after a federal law banning desecration of the flag took effect. `` We will not stand for this law to be passed,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, an Army veteran who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from 1970 to 1971. `` We're burning the flag to say we will not stand by to see forced patriotism. Abridgment of the First Amendment right is the first infringement,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said, referring to the Constitution's right of free speech. The demonstration was held shortly after the anti-desecration law took effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The law, sparked by a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision permitting flag burning on free-speech grounds, carries penalties of up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. In protests Friday, four flags were burned at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a flag burning at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was halted when a passerby snuffed the flames with his bare hands. The <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> group, which including neo-Nazi skinheads and counterculture types of various stripes, cheered wildly and profanely as two small piles of flags were set afire outside the Post Office. They sang the national anthem as a flag was lowered down a pole outside the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, soaked with lighter fluid, then set alight and raised back into the night sky. The handful of organizers from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Against the War Anti-Imperialist said there were 1,000 flags _ one large and most of the rest the size of a large postage stamp _ in two metal pans placed on the sidewalk outside the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. People in the crowd also produced a flag that was held aloft and torched as the national anthem was sung. Loud cheers went up when a flag from a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant was produced for burning. It melted but would not burst into flame. After the demonstration, protesters milled up and down the street in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s Capital Hill section. They blocked traffic and occasional fights with clubs and bottles broke out, but no serious injuries were reported. Several people, some apparently drunk, argued the pros and cons of flag-burning and ripped at least one flag to shreds as they fought over it. No uniformed police were seen in the vicinity, although police spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulgren </PERSON> had said Friday there would be arrests if a law was broken. Members of the veterans' group had said they would have <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> lawyers at the scene as observers. However, it was not apparent such observers were present. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the law encourages the very action it's intended to discourage. `` There were no incidents of public flag burning in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the prohibition,'' she said. `` Liberty needs special protection, not its symbol, the flag.''

 Government soldiers seized six members of an American medical team and two South African colleagues and held them at a military compound in northern <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday. In <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Courson </PERSON>, president of the Carlsbad-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION>, said late Saturday that all eight had been flown to the capital of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. He reported information received from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> saying the eight had been held at a military outpost at <LOCATION> Tete </LOCATION>, near the border, and were flown 290 miles south to <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was to meet with them there Sunday morning. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities were told the eight were still in the custody of Mozambican soldiers and were being transported to <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have any confirmation that they have been freed,'' she said. She added she did not know if any charges had been filed against them. <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> said he understood that they had not been charged. Guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance have waged an insurgency against <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s leftist government since 1977. Hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced because of the fighting and resultant food shortages. The Americans and South Africans were captured near the Malawi-Mozambique border in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Courson </PERSON>, the relief group's director of medical services. She identified the Americans as Dr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Leist </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Leist </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, a dentist from <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and paramedics <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stroudsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>. Also seized were South African missionaries <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezedenhout </PERSON> who were serving as guides, according to the relief organization. The Mozambican news agency AIM had not reported the incident as of Saturday afternoon but responded to an inquiry with a message saying a group of foreigners had been captured near the <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> border, possibly after entering illegally with guerrillas. AIM said <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> had ties with the South African military and ran an organization called `` Front-line Fellowship'' which is strongly opposed to the Mozambican government. Ms. <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> said the group had just arrived at the Malawi-Mozambique border when they encountered the troops and were captured. She said the organization learned of the abduction in a phone call early Friday from <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s wife. `` <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> was their first stop. They were going to be setting up medical clinics and dental clinics in the refugee camps along the Malawi-Mozambique border,'' Ms. <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> said. `` As far as how or when or why they were abducted, we do n't have the answers.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Efird </PERSON>, the spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization has sent teams to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and other war-torn countries since 1974. Ms. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said earlier Saturday, `` We are aware of reports that six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were detained by <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- government -RRB- troops on Oct. 24'' and there is concern `` as to their fate.'' `` Our ambassador is looking into the matter with the government of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has promised us a response,'' she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> that the organization's interest was humanitarian, with no political motives. He said the organization frequently sends medical teams to areas where there is some risk but there have been no previous problems. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 26, is employed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> service in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and took a two-week vacation to join the relief team, said her mother, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` Being in the type of work that she is, she's in very tight circumstances sometimes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> American on Saturday. `` I would imagine she's handling herself all right there, too.'' She said her daughter left for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Oct. 20 and was to return home Nov. 5.

 Hundreds of mourners attending the funeral of a woman Saturday heard her eulogized as a generous, loving person who would reject any vengeance against the gunman who killed her and wounded her husband. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> remained in critical condition, but a friend read a letter he wrote from his hospital bed saying how much he would miss his wife, who gave birth to their first child shortly before she died. `` My life will be empty without you,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> wrote. `` Now you're taken away from me. I will never know the feeling of your hand in mine.'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 30, was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in <LOCATION> Malden </LOCATION>, a suburb north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, after a funeral Mass that packed <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellsway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> with about 300 mourners. Among the mourners were Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>. The Stuarts were leaving <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Monday night after attending a birthing class when an assailant commandeered their car and forced them to drive into an adjacent inner-city neighborhood, where he robbed and shot them. Although he'd been shot in the abdomen, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29, summoned police on his car telephone. When police arrived 10 minutes later, they found that Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, who was 32 weeks pregnant, had been shot in the head. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> died shortly after doctors at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's delivered her son, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> The infant remained hospitalized Saturday. Officials have declined to discuss his condition. Police said they had no new clues and were hoping to see <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> again Monday. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman said. A description <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> provided Wednesday helped police narrow the list of suspects to three or four.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday condemned Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for a `` shameful'' decision to end a lengthy cease-fire with the Contras and hinted at renewing arms for the rebels even as he urged them to avoid military aggression. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who shattered the tranquility of a two-day Hemispheric `` celebration of democracy'' with his military plans, later softened his stand and said he would decide Tuesday whether to extend the cease-fire. He accused the Contras of mounting `` waves of attacks'' inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The two leaders clashed at rival news conferences that upstaged the ending to the two-day conference, and the most personal language by far came from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president belittled the leftist Nicaraguan leader as `` this little man _ showing up in his military uniform at a democracy meeting,'' and said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` looks like that unwanted animal at a garden party.'' A spokesman for <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, host of the gathering, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had `` dashed cold water on the party, since he was invited to a party for democracy and should have behaved properly.'' `` Nothing like this has ever been seen before,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, General Secretary <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he was `` extremely concerned'' about the recent clashes between the Contras and the Sandinista forces and the apparent breakdown of the cease-fire. He expressed his `` strong wish'' that both sides exercise restraint so that the peace process may continue. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, government troops were reportedly being moved to strategic points in what could be preparations for new military operations. Government-run Radio Catarran in central Chontales province said more than 1,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> were being transported to guard the strategically important <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> Road </PERSON> after rebel activity in the area. The final act of the two-day summit _ dedication of an outdoor `` Democracy Plaza'' in the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital _ was played out without <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who left for home early. School children carrying the flags of the nations represented made up more than half of the crowd, which did not quite fill the square. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watched the ceremony from behind a thick, transparent bullet-proof shield that had been installed by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Before departing, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> underscored his intention to break the 19-month-old cease-fire between forces of his leftist Sandinista government and the Contra guerrillas. But after arriving back in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, he told reporters he would announce on Tuesday whether the truce would be extended for another month, as it has almost monthly since March 1988. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, had offered to mediate any discussions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` The waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries have increased enormously in the last few weeks. The objective is the destruction of the electoral process in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who is running for re-election in Feb. 25 elections. He said he would continue observing the truce only if non-lethal American aid currently going to the Contras were used, instead, to demobilize the rebels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had encouraged the Contras `` not to take aggressive military action, and we would certainly continue to do that.'' In comments after speaking to the Costa Rican journalists association, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> pledged to `` work to make sure that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision is not carried out. He said he thought the conflict could still be mediated and that he, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and other Latin American leaders would be able to help. After an early morning tennis game with Argentine President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with Nicaraguan opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> and Panamanian opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as well as a group of Costa Rican political figures. He emerged afterwards to tell a news conference that several of the leaders at the conference have told <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> it would be `` sheer folly'' to resume hostilities. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> -RRB- knows that if there's an all-put military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked if that meant he would seek more military aid for the Contras, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We'll let you know. We'll let you know.'' He also said, `` I do n't think the Contras ought to attack. What we ought to do is fulfill the agreements'' forged by <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. He added, `` We have encouraged the Contras not to take aggressive military action. And we would certainly continue to do that.'' Under <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' plan, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had agreed to hold free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in February and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld military aid to the Contras. Faced with resistance from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for providing more arms for the Contras, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reversed eight years of President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy by endorsing a diplomatic rather than a military solution to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> conflict <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, en route back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, told reporters, `` It was a great visit.'' Asked about the tone of his criticisms of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said only, `` Speaks for itself.'' An administration official who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s move may be intended to give the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` an excuse to tighten up internally'' and `` to have troops out to intimidate people'' before the February elections. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blistered <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> with unrelenting criticism, sarcasm and insults. Professing bewilderment at <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't figure it out. ... I've asked our own folks, what in heaven's name would make a person do something so counterproductive _ stick him out like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democratically-elected leaders, offend a host -LRB- Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. Referring to his handshake with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` He's always kind of sidling up to me looking for some photo op. What he ought to do is talk to the -LRB- Nicaraguan -RRB- resistance.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s action `` a shameful blow to democracy.'' Warning <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> not to backtrack from presidential elections on Feb. 25, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The people of this hemisphere know the difference between real elections and sham elections, and the hemisphere will not settle for anything less than free and fair elections.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also took aim at Panamanian ruler, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying he represented an outlaw regime that `` simply must be replaced.'' The president said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` may think his lead pipe politics have won, but he's won nothing more than a fragile status quo. And democracy really will triumph in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, I'm confident of that.''

 A pedestrian bridge with as many as 50 people on it collapsed Saturday afternoon, killing five people and seriously injuring 18, after some rocked the span back and forth, authorities said. One other person was believed missing after the 50-foot-high, 200 - to 300-foot-long steel suspension bridge fell into the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleburne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> Rescue crews, who used chain saws and cranes to remove the tangled remains of the 77-year-old bridge as darkness fell, found the bodies of three of the dead around 9 p.m., more than five hours after the accident. There were 30 to 50 people on the popular bridge, including members of a church group in nearby Prim for their annual meeting and a Boy Scout troop, when the accident occurred around 3:40 p.m., officials said. Some of the people rocked the span, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said. `` The cable on the upstream side broke and the bridge fell to one side. The other cable broke and the whole thing came down,'' he said. `` I had just gotten here and they were rocking the bridge,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> of <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who was part of the Free Holiness church group. `` We thought it was kind of fun and it scared some people.'' The collapse `` just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry for help,'' he said. `` ... They did n't know what happened. It was pure terror. Arms were flailing. People were panicking. Everyone was trying to save themselves.'' Coroner <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON> identified the dead as <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Muldrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltman </PERSON>, 11, of <PERSON> Vancleve </PERSON>, Miss.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Mayfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Catrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotrell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, in her mid-20s and <PERSON> Gayla </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> of Prim, in her 30s. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> were found first. The other three bodies were found in the wreckage. Eighteen people were taken to <LOCATION> Cleburne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Heber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, which is five miles northwest of the bridge, said hospital administrator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fray </PERSON>. `` Most of the injuries were broken bones,'' Fray said. Nine people were hospitalized, including three who were transferred to a hospital in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> nearly 60 miles to the southeast and three who went to a hospital in <LOCATION> Searcy </LOCATION> nearly 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Heber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fray </PERSON> said. The remaining nine were treated and released. Ambulances from three neighboring counties helped take the injured to hospitals, said county dispatcher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooten </PERSON>. `` At first, there were so many injured, people were taking them to the hospital in personal cars and police cars,'' <PERSON> Hooten </PERSON> said. None of the people fishing in boats near the bridge were hurt, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said. An estimated 100 to 150 people were taking part in the rescue effort, said county jailer <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>. Two large cranes were set up on opposite sides of the river. Cranes were brought to lift the wreckage of the bridge and determine if anyone was underneath, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> dispatched a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> company based in <LOCATION> Heber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> that is equipped with a large crane, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauldin </PERSON>. A state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> bulldozer was brought there, and another was on the way. The bridge sits in a popular recreational area. It is common for people on the bridge to try to rock it, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> KAWW </ORGANIZATION> radio station in <LOCATION> Heber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The bridge was built in 1912, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said. It was closed to vehicles in 1972. `` It was kept as a walking bridge,'' said <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkeen </PERSON>, whose Swinging Bridge Boat Dock sits below the span. `` It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places four years ago.'' `` There's nothing left standing but the pylons on the bank,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators believe a flaw developed in the manufacture of an engine part of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 caused the plane's mid-air explosion over <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in July, according to a published report. The DC-10 jet, which lost its hydraulic flight controls July 19, in the breakup of its tail-mounted engine, crashed in flames in an attempted landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that killed 112 of the 296 people on board. A federal hearing on Tuesday will focus on whether the problem in the engine's fan disk should have been detected before the crash, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last month ordered metallurgical tests on the engine disks of other aircraft that were made in the same manufacturing process. Officials for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is investigating the crash, could not be reached for comment late Saturday. Investigators discovered a crack in the engine's fan disk, which they found in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cornfield earlier this month, which they have suspected led to the explosion and loss of the plane's hydraulic system. `` The origin of the crack appears to be the thing that started the whole sequence of events,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> also said detailed inspections of the disk from the flight indicate the crack began with an internal flaw caused by the `` double melting'' process used to make the titanium in the disk 19 years ago. Further tests have been ordered by the government are expected to be completed no sooner than February.

 Rescue workers Saturday recovered the bodies of six more victims of the explosion at the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plastics plant, raising the death toll to at least the 13, officials said. The search for nine other workers missing since Monday's explosions continued around the clock The search has been stymied by debris up to 40 feet high near the control and finishing room, where it's expected the missing workers will be found, said company spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. The blasts injured 124 people. Until Saturday, seven bodies had been recovered. Five bodies were found early Saturday, and the sixth was found during the afternoon, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. Only four of the dead have been positively identified, said <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman.

<HEAD>Dust Settles, Rubble Left</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that the dust has settled, the rubble remains. It ranges from 1 \ miles of collapsed Interstate 880 to the kindling-sized splinters of destroyed houses around the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area Disposing of the mess will be a major problem for months after the Oct. 17 earthquake, and already garbage bins are as ubiquitous as espresso machines. No formal accounting has been made, although it is unlikely to approach the 11 million cubic yards produced by 28,000 destroyed buildings in 1906. In a tragic irony, much of that rubble was pushed into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and covered with sand to form the foundation of the posh <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district. In the latest quake, the landfill turned to jelly, amplifying the shaking and destroying 60 buildings. The quake also uncovered a brick and a piece of concrete from the 1906 rubble. It is a cycle that may be repeated this time, although not with homes. Officials say the biggest piece of rubble, the Interstate 880 viaduct, may be ground up and used as landfill in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. That frustrates quake experts who for years have warned against such practices, with little result in the land-hungry Bay area. `` We know and have said for a long time that -LRB- landfill is -RRB- a more risky place to build and this earthquake confirms that,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, a scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Landfills ordinarily appear solid, `` but under earthquake shaking they essentially liquefy and offer the ground above no support and you have a major failure,'' <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said. Despite the lessons of history, building on landfill continues. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> voters go to the polls Nov. 7 to decide whether to build a new baseball stadium. The proposed site is on landfill. Land is so expensive and devastating earthquakes so far apart that people are encouraged to take their chances, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION>. After all, it was 83 years between devastating quakes in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Every generation figures it wo n't happen in my lifetime.'' If the ground is properly compacted and clay is added, and if expensive techniques are used, it can be safe to build on landfill, she said. But many of the buildings destroyed in the quake were not built with modern techniques. In a briefing last week, the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said many of the problems had been known about before the 7.1 magnitude quake: `` The greatest loss of life and damage to property during the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> earthquake occurred in areas where geologic hazards had been clearly identified and mapped as early as 15 years ago.'' The outer perimeter of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, including the highrise-studded Financial District, was built as landfill claimed the bay. It is a constant source of worry that the anticipated Big One will liquefy the ground and topple the buildings. The pattern of damage in the latest quake suggests that could happen. I-880, whose collapse killed dozens, was built on landfill. So was the heavily damaged Embarcadero Freeway, which will be closed three months. So was Candlestick Park, which suffered slight damage. The main runway of the Oakland airport is on landfill, and 3,000 feet of it sank. So did the busy Seventh Street terminal at the Port of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, which handles 7 percent of the freight at the nation's fourth-busiest port. It was resting on landfill. In other parts of the earthquake zone, the problem was n't landfill but ancient streams that have been built over but produce the same earthquake result as landfill In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, where 30 buildings collapsed, the town was built on old stream deposits that had gathered in a wet geologic bowl. When the land gave way so did the buildings. The story was the same in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, where 195 buildings and 106 mobile homes were destroyed and 235 suffered major damage. The heavily damaged <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> lies on stream deposits that also liquefied in the 1906 quake. Despite its landfill-related damage, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> has requested the rubble from I-880, to shore up quake-damaged areas, said port spokesman <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>. `` They'd have to crush it and remove the steel so all that was left was aggregate'' which can be mixed to form cement, he said. `` As long as you do n't have an earthquake it's quite good.'' The ground-up freeway would be stored on seven acres at the airport and used as needed, he said. The freeway rubble weighs about 40,000 tons, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Drago </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the mess. Department officials say the contractors chosen soon to remove the debris will decide who gets the rubble. Another alternative causing controversy is a proposal to place the rubble onto barges and dump it 42 miles out to sea at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> dump site, where it would serve as fish habitat. Environmentalists and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., oppose the proposal, saying the rubble could hurt fishing While government agencies will foot the bill to remove public structures, homeowners have to pay for their own demolition and removal. Most of the hundreds of destroyed homes will be buried in the <ORGANIZATION> Zanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> landfill near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, a bayside garbage and recycling facility that will never be overbuilt with homes, said site engineer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>. For the next two months, the company expects 1,500 cubic yards of quake-related debris a day, and has added 10 workers to handle the load. It costs $ 5.30 to $ 8.50 per cubic yard to bury debris at the landfill, he said. `` We currently recycle 33 percent of incoming material, and that should increase to 40 to 45 percent,'' he said. Most valuable items include old bricks, wood, metals, concrete and dirt. In <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, contractors are eager to recover construction materials, said City Clerk <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. `` We've had a number of contractors call and volunteer to bring dump trucks in. They are chomping at the bit to get more brick.'' Demolition of downtown businesses worth $ 200 million is to begin Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> said. The federal government will pay to remove buildings considered a public danger, but owners are responsible otherwise. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which has 250 buildings considered unsafe, two garbage operators have offered to go through the rubble of destroyed homes as they dispose of the structures at the Zanker landfill, said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Pla </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. `` They clearly are looking for irreplaceable items'' which will be returned to owners, she said.

<HEAD>Exxon Exit Reflects Deepening Problem For New York's Business Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three hundred departing jobs might not mean much in a metropolitan work force of 3 million, but when the company exiting with them is oil giant <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> it sends a profound message about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s eroding reputation as the national front-office capital. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest oil company and third-largest American industrial concern after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced the impending closure of its 107-year home base in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this past week. The company is moving the headquarters to the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, where it will save on rent, taxes, building costs and employee commuting time. How much it will save remains unclear. But the gleaming 54-story building the company has occupied in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> rents for about $ 50 a square foot, vs. about $ 10 for the temporary space <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will move into until a new headquarters is constructed on a former ranch in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb. Of course, the departure is n't like <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> shutting down a factory in a one-factory town. It is likely that new tenants will replace <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the outside world will barely notice. Much of the building's space was occupied by other tenants already. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials, surprised and annoyed by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, quickly emphasized what they called the city's strength in retaining businesses, despite the high-profile departures of other corporate giants in recent years ranging from retailer <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> `` Although <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is certainly a major company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in the country and the world, the practical matter is they employed 300 people here,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, deputy mayor for finance and economic development. But others said it was n't the 300 jobs that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> should worry about. Instead, they emphasized the symbolic meaning of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s departure in a city where symbolism is a crucial element of attracting business in the first place. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is very much dependent on its image,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>, regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> and an authority on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area's economy. `` If everybody else is here, this is the place to be,'' he said. `` If this is the place of action, then people will be here. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is based on the people that make it creative and exciting. That reflects its key role as a national and international financial and business service center.'' More than 100 leading American corporations make their home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, more than any other single <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city. In addition, thousands of other companies have important <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office operations. But <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> figures show that employment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s corporate administrative-office category has fallen from 54,000 jobs 10 years ago to about 29,000 now. The significance of these numbers goes beyond simple arithmetic. Thousands of other jobs, from advertising executives to janitors to restaurateurs, are directly dependent on the front-office segment of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s economy. In addition, the departure of big-name companies like <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is coming at a time when the Northeast's economy is softening. This makes it less likely, for example, that major trade organizations will book conventions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, opting instead for cheaper areas or meetings close to home. To a large extent, the departure of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> reflects the technological leaps made during the 1980s, enabling corporations to do business by telephone, computer networks and facsimile machines. That means they can be headquartered practically anywhere there's a phone and an electrical outlet. `` I think what we see here is a picture of increasing vulnerability as a result of stiffening competitive pressures and improvements that permits relocation of companies historically based in the city,'' <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said. `` It means the city must look to shore up its competitive strengths.'' In other business and economic news this past week: _ Wall Street spoke with two voices on a computerized form of stock trading that critics blame for roiling the market Several key brokerages said they would restrict use of one type of so-called program trading because an investor outcry. But the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> began trading in a new product called a `` stock basket'' that makes program trading much easier. _ Prospects of a debt-financed takeover for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> grew more distant, reflecting an increased resistance to the use of high-yield `` junk bonds'' to bankroll corporate acquisitions Directors of the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said they wanted to keep the company independent. _ The Big Three automakers reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings due the high cost of summertime incentives aimed at peddling more vehicles At the same time, a takeover battle appeared to be emerging between <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s luxury carmaker <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the central bank could erase inflation with painful short-term policies, but he evidently was n't including beer drinkers in his analysis They could benefit from lower inflation without pain due to aggressive price-cutting plans announced by <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, which were part of an industry-wide price war.

<HEAD>Stocks' New Problem: Lagging Profits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Corporate profits, often relegated to a subordinate role in recent years, have staged a strong comeback as a driving force in the stock market. But unhappily for investors who like their news upbeat, the earnings news that has been capturing most of the attention has been negative. And as Wall Street looks ahead to 1990, uneasy talk is starting to revive of a recession or at least a `` bumpy landing'' for the economy. `` A steady drumbeat of disappointing earnings reports lent a dolorous tone to financial markets last week,'' said economists at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in their weekend appraisal of the financial outlook. `` Unfortunately, more of the same is likely in the period ahead.'' Many optimists on Wall Street have long been counting on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to stave off any impending slump by relaxing its credit policy and setting up a `` soft landing'' for businesses, consumers and the markets. Indeed, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> seemed to carry out just such a mission adroitly during the summer, when a recession scare hit the Street. Many observers now think circumstances will soon prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease again. But some wonder whether the central bank can keep succeeding in its fine-tuning efforts to restrain inflation without putting businesses through a period of pain. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may have waited too long,'' say the economists <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> in the new edition of their newsletter Industry Forecast. `` The expansion is looking sicker almost every day. `` A recession in the coming nine months, while not a certainty, is now more probable than not. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy may already have passed the business cycle peak.'' Government data issued Thursday seemed to suggest growth still was slogging along at a slow-to-moderate clip. Preliminary figures for the third quarter showed the gross national product expanding at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, matching the pace set in the second quarter. But a lot of the third-quarter strength was concentrated in consumer spending, especially for cars, that many analysts consider unlikely to persist. On Wall Street, many traders' view of consumer stocks already has been soured by signs of intensified price competition in businesses ranging from fast-food restaurants to beer. The stock market fell steadily all through the past week, leaving the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials with a loss of 92.42 points at 2,596.72, wiping out most of the previous week's 119.88 gain The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index dropped 6.52 to 185.60; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 18.30 to 452.33, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 12.56 at 370.01. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 175.01 million shares a day, against 234.04 million the week before. Whatever weakness in corporate profits might mean to the stock market, many analysts believe it will soon be a plus for higher government bond prices and lower interest rates. The recent inflation news has been better than expected, they note, giving the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> more apparent maneuvering room to pursue a stimulative credit policy. `` Inflation has been beaten for the moment,'' contends <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We believe that fourth-quarter growth will be the slowest of the year. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will soon conclude that the major danger is economic weakness, not strength.''

<HEAD>Investors Warm to Thrift Bailout Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's savings and loan bailout plan has passed a crucial test with better marks than expected. The introductory sale last week of 30-year bonds used to raise money for rescuing the nation's sickly thrifts went without a hitch. Despite familiar rumblings in the credit markets that the supply would be tough to absorb and distribute profitably, demand was good at the auction of the dubiously nicknamed `` bailout bonds.'' The average yield on the $ 4.52 billion of tenders accepted was 8.15 percent. Nearly $ 13 billion in bids were received at what was the first 30-year bond auction by <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ known as <ORGANIZATION> Refcorp </ORGANIZATION> _ which was created to raise some of the cash needed to save troubled savings institutions. What is called the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.87 to 1. The ratio, which compares the number of bids received to the number accepted, is a measure of investor demand. Surprisingly, the ratio produced in the bailout bond auction was better than at recent sales of 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, historically considered the best-quality government debt securities. Part of the bailout-bond buying interest came from bond dealers planning to `` strip'' the issue for repackaging as a zero-coupon security. The dealers intend to sever the interest payment part of the bond from the principal payment portion and sell the two pieces separately at a deep discount to face value, or par. Zeros are bonds lacking the coupons that entitle a bondholder to periodic interest payments _ all the interest is paid at maturity. `` I am very pleased with how well the auction went,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basham </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Given that the bond market always gets edgy ahead of long-term debt auctions _ particularly when new types of securities are involved _ <PERSON> Basham </PERSON> said `` It went exceptionally well.'' As expected, the bailout bonds sold Wednesday went for a slight premium over the yield on recently auctioned <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues of the same maturity. The benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond closed trading in the credit markets Wednesday at an average yield of 7.88 percent, making the premium 0.27 point. The market does n't perceive Refcorp's bonds to be quite as unshakable as regular <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, which have the comforting support of the federal government's full faith and credit. But the government does guarantee that interest and principal will be paid on Refcorp's bonds, granting them almost the same strong backing. Market analysts say once investors become accustomed to dealing with the bailout bonds, the spread between Treasuries and Refcorp issues will shrink. `` I think this is a name that people eventually will become familiar with and a little bit more comfortable with,'' says <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Stone, a senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Subsequently, we can look for narrower spreads between the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bonds and Refcorp's.'' Refcorp has authority to issue up to $ 30 billion in 30-year bonds and it is expected that auctions will be held once a quarter. <PERSON> Basham </PERSON> said the next sale likely would occur in January.

<HEAD>Hog Market Apparently Peaks, Ending 6-Week Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork producers are bracing for a drop in hog prices after an unusual autumn rally appeared to reach its peak in the past week. But analysts say the descent probably will be less dramatic than the dizzying six-week rise because farmers marketed hogs aggressively as prices climbed and the animals now coming to market are smaller than in past years. On other commodity markets in the past week, copper prices nosedived amid fears that the stock market's gyrations signal economic troubles ahead; precious metals rallied; energy prices fell; wheat retreated; and corn and soybeans held steady. The hog futures market appeared to peak on Monday when the contract for December delivery reached 47.90 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The price fell to 46.17 cents by the end of trading Friday. Monday's high price represented a 16 percent increase in hog futures since Sept. 8, the starting point for the market's surge. Analysts cited two main reasons for the upswing, which defied the normal seasonal pattern: high beef prices and strong Japanese demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork. Beef prices reached record highs last spring, partly due to drought-related herd thinning during the previous summer, and have n't backed off much since. With beef so expensive, consumers gravitated toward lower-priced pork. Retailers seeking to fill that demand bid up wholesale pork prices, and the increase worked its way back to the meatpackers who buy hogs from producers. Meanwhile, tighter supplies of pork from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> forced the Japanese to increase their purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork by 30 percent over a year ago, according to a recent report from the futures brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, cash hog prices soared and are expected to average about $ 48 per hundredweight this month in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> compared with about $ 40 last October And for only the second time in the last 20 years, according to analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the October average hog price will be near or higher than the July average, which was $ 48.22 per hundredweight this year compared with $ 46.59 in 1988. The runup peaked at the wholesale level about two weeks ago as the Japanese completed their buying, hog slaughters approached their seasonal peak, consumer demand slackened due to the higher pork prices and retailers began shifting their sights to obtaining poultry for the upcoming holidays. On Monday, Oct. 16, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said, fresh pork loins were quoted at $ 1.21 a pound. One week later, the price had dropped to $ 1.10 to $ 1.12. And by this past Thursday, the price had fallen further, to $ 1.04 to $ 1.07. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said hog prices are likely to continue weakening through Thanksgiving. But because producers were active sellers during the rally, cash hog prices may not drop much below $ 44 per hundredweight, he said. `` Because the hogs are lighter in weight and producers are much more current on marketings, we are could get a much softer landing this time than we have in recent years and especially last year,'' he said, when cash hogs bottomed at less than $ 38.

 Copper prices weakened steadily through the week, reaching new 2 -LCB- - month lows on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> The selling was linked to an improved supply outlook and to recession fears fueled by the stock market's erratic moves, which included sharp drops on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Copper is heavily used in construction and industrial applications and a weaker economy would reduce demand for the metal. Copper for December delivery settled Friday at $ 1.1580 a pound compared with $ 1.2345 a week earlier and $ 1.3050 the week before that.
