 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, named Tuesday to investigate the ethical conduct of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, has raised money for Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and was elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. But some of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s associates took issue with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> claims that the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer is a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activist who could n't impartially investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, also a Democrat. Although he was a delegate to the Democratic convention last week, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> decided not to go. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, 51, was elected as a delegate pledged to the failed presidential bid of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., but resigned before the convention, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> did not indicate why <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, who had served as a <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser, had resigned. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s selection Tuesday drew criticism from Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which sent a Mailgram message to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics committee saying, `` The appointment of liberal Democrat activist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as outside counsel in the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case certainly calls into question the independence of the ethics committee inquiry.'' But <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s national finance director, took issue with characterizing <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as an `` activist.'' `` I assume he's been active locally, but I've been involved in Democratic politics at the statewide level for six years and this year was the first time I ever met Mr. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> is a 1958 graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>, and received his law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1961, the same year he was admitted to the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> bar. He is the author of numerous articles on litigation and was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1985-86. Last year, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> successfully defended <ORGANIZATION> Jewel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a lawsuit in which attorneys sought $ 100 million in punitive damages for hundreds of people sickened in the nation's largest outbreak of salmonella. The outbreak in 1985 had been traced to milk from a Jewel dairy in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The company ended up compensating those who fell ill for their actual losses but not paying extra punitive damages. Attorneys at <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s firm said the case was the largest personal injury product liability class action yet settled. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> also defended the city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in a case brought by a black patrolmen's association which contended the police force had discriminated against black officers. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, an architect, have three children. They live in a northern <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the evenly divided 12-member panel had agreed on <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s selection Members of both parties were satisified that he could do an impartial job, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. The contract with <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> firm, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, will be for no more than $ 300,000, he said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he could not estimate how long the investigation would take.

 Partial train service was restored Wednesday as striking locomotive drivers began returning to work after police arrested hundreds of strikers and supporters. Hundreds of locomotive drivers and assistants demanding higher pay and shorter hours walked off the job Tuesday after refusing to accept a compromise deal on allowances and working hours. The <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> said services were operating at about 30 percent of normal levels after being virtually crippled Tuesday. Railroad officials said they hoped to restore almost full service by Thursday as strikers returned to work. Surburban train service around <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, which was affected by the strike, was back to normal early Wednesday, railroad officials said. Police officials, who declined to be named, said 420 people were still being held Wednesday after about 1,460 striking drivers and members of their families were arrested the day before for blocking stations and other railroad facilities. The others had been released with reprimands, police said. Of the ramaining 420 still in custody, officials said about 20 were strike leaders facing charges of conducting an illegal strike. The others would probably be handed over to summary courts to face minor charges, they said. The government moved to crush the strike and thousands of riot police were sent to stations and railway yards to stop peaceful protests by the strikers and their families. The Cabinet held an emergency session Tuesday to oversee handling of the affair. Those arrested defied police orders to disperse, but there were no reports of violent clashes, police said. Railroad officials said strikers were returning to work, but they had no overall figures on how many of the some 4,400 drivers and assistants had joined the strike. They said they expect most strikers to resume work Wednesday. But reports in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers Wednesday said some strikers said they would not return to work until all strikers arrested by police had been freed. The officials said the strike cost the KNR an estimated $ 2.5 million Tuesday alone and that there was no estimate yet as to losses suffered by other industries. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-duk </PERSON>, head of the railroad authority, said the strike was illegal because it had not been approved by the railroad union. Strikers said a compromise deal worked out by the union failed to satisfy demands for shorter work hours and a 100 percent raise in allowances paid on top of normal salaries. Under the rejected deal, the railroad would raise allowances from about $ 100 to $ 138 a month and cut workloads from 245 hours to 224 hours a month. The strikers wanted work hours cut to 144 hours. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s train drivers with about 10 years's expereince earn about $ 1,200 a month in regular salary and various allowances, which include overtime, holiday allowance, locomotive drivers allowance, according to the railroad.

<HEAD>Democratic Convention a Turn-Off for Networks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Democratic National Convention would have been a big ratings hit last week if only one network had showed up. With three sharing the coverage, however, the convention drove millions of viewers to other channels. The three-network share of the viewing audience fell to 49 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings last week, meaning that fewer than half the sets in use during prime time were tuned to a network. That compares to a 68 percent share for the three networks this season. During convention week in 1984, the three-network share was 54 percent, according to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research, who said last week's share was the worst ever for the networks. During the four days of the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the networks' prime-time share this year was 40 percent <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> estimated that perhaps another 1 percent of the audience was watching the convention on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The best finish for campaign coverage was 26th for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night, with a rating of 8.7, while <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had the low on Monday night with a 5.7 for 52nd place. However, the three-network total for Tuesday night's coverage was a rating of 23.2, compared with 15.6 for `` Golden Girls,'' the week's top-rated show. Cumulative totals for the other nights were 20.1 for Monday, 20.1 for Wednesday and 21.1 on Thursday. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. Because of the lack of suspense at this year's Democratic Convention and the expectation that the Republican National Convention also will be largely a scripted media event, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> News President <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> has said his network might pare its coverage of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gathering. The two other networks have said they will give the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> as much time as the Democrats got. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had the biggest convention audience with a 7.4 average rating for the four nights. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was the only network to have better convention ratings than in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 6.9 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was third with 6.5. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week with an average rating of 9.4, more than a third less than its season average. CBS was second at 7.9 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 7.8. For the 44 weeks of the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads with an average prime-time rating of 15.0, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> at 12.6 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at 12.5. News ratings also were down last week. CBS was the winner with an 8.6 rating, half a point lower than its winning number a week earlier. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second at 8.6, down 0.6, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was in third at 7.8, down 0.9. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s reruns again dominated the week. Here is the top 10: `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Cosby Show'' and `` Hunter'' -LRB- tie -RRB-, both <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS; `` Deliberate Stranger'' part 1, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Sunday Night Movie; `` Murder She Wrote,'' CBS; `` Amen,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Sin of Innocence,'' the `` CBS Sunday Movie,'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' -LRB- tie -RRB-; `` <PERSON> Alf </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Ultralight Crashes After Encounter With West German Fighter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EGGENFELDEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pilot of an ultralight airplane was killed after his craft apparently struck a West German Tornado jet fighter in flight and crashed, police said. Police said a preliminary investigation indicated the light plane nicked the fighter before Tuesday's crash. But officials did not rule out the possibility that turbulence from the jet's engine sent the ultralight down. The dead pilot was not identified. The crash occurred near <LOCATION> Eggenfelden </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. The jet was not damaged and returned to its base near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, officials said. Police did not say whether the Tornado was on a low-level training flight. A series of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warplane crashes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in recent weeks has resulted in a growing demand that low-level military training flights be banned or sharply reduced.

<HEAD>Economic Reforms Lead To 1 Million Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to modernize industry and trim fat from management forced nearly 1 million Soviet factory workers out of work in the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported. But those laid off are sure to get other jobs `` since the government has undertaken to redistribute the labor force in a planned manner,'' the state-run radio said Tuesday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in March 1985, has waged a campaign to reform the country's economy, increase productivity and prune the size of the state bureaucracy. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda estimated that 16 million Soviets would be laid off in the next 12 years as efficiency increases. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said: `` The number of workers in Soviet industries has gone down by almost 1 million in the first half of the year, compared with the same period last year.'' `` The national statistical service attributes the fact to the current economic reform, which is introducing more automatic systems and streamlining management,'' the radio said. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did not provide the size of the labor force in the country's factories last year or today. In 1986, 82.1 million of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 276 million citizens were officially classified as `` workers,'' as distinguished from white-collar service or management personnel and collective farmers.

 The estranged wife of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> says she was stunned to learn that comments she made during an intimate conversation with biographer <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> were published in a magazine. August's issue of Washingtonian magazine offers a revealing account of the <ORGANIZATION> Cookes </ORGANIZATION>' tumultuous marriage based on two interviews between Miss <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>. The interviews were conducted two years apart. Among the revelations is Mrs. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>'s account of her two abortions after getting pregnant by <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, and how the billionaire football team owner only agreed to marry her on condition that she end a third pregnancy by him. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, 31, never got the third abortion and is the mother of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, born Jan. 25. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, 76, has never seen the baby. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said Tuesday she objects to the use of the intimate details she gave <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> in 1986. `` I was stunned by the quotations that were printed from the early interviews,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said. But Miss <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> knew during both interviews that she was being taped. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said her marriage to <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> is over and has sued him for $ 15 million for a trust fund for her daughter.

<TEXT>
 On an evening in 1856, Rep. <PERSON> Philemon </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, one of the more obscure members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was waiting for service in the dining room of the capital's preeminent hotel, The <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> Growing hungrier _ and angrier _ by the minute, he was resolutely ignored by a haughty waiter. According to a new history of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, `` Losing his patience, and perhaps feeling the snub more acutely than he had a right to do, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> pulled his pistol and shot and killed the man.'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s rather extreme reaction to this unacceptable affront to his congressional dignity is recounted by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, who adds: `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did not censure Rep. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> for his act, thereby giving a certain justification to it.'' This was, perhaps, not a high moment in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or of its members. But <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> waiters ever since have been closely observant of the needs of hungry <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members. The temper tantrum of the ignored congressman and its fatal result is but a minor low point in a new volume sketching the 199-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, most of which is devoted to far more consequential affairs of state. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>'s work, and a companion history of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by its official historian, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, have been issued to mark next year's celebration of the bicentennial of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They set out the milestones of the nation's legislative history, with an occasional side look at some of the more unusual, and eccentric, people and events along the way. For the most part, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s history of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ignores the existence of the House. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>'s history of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> mostly ignores the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But not entirely. At the very beginning, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> historian notes, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposed that the nation's president be addressed as `` His Highness, President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Protector of the Rights of the Same.'' <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> calls this `` an awful appellation'' and records that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would have none of it. The president has been `` Mr. President'' ever since. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recalls how <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeTocqueville </PERSON>, the French observer of American institutions, was struck in 1831 by the `` vulgar demeanor'' of the popularly elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, whose members were elected by state legislatures. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Tocqueville </PERSON>, `` is composed of eloquent advocates, distinguished generals, wise magistrates and statesmen of note, whose arguments would do honor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he sniffed, was composed of men of far lower qualifications and standing in society. `` In a country in which education is very general, it is said that the representatives of the people do not always know how to write correctly.'' In fairness, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> notes that Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> took exception to this, branding <PERSON> DeTocqueville </PERSON> and his opinions as `` elitist.'' `` The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> senator observed that most senators had originally been House members.'' <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> notes that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> is said to have asked <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> why the Constitutional Convention had created a two-house legislature. Why was n't one house enough? `` Why did you pour your tea into that saucer? asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` To cool it,'' replied <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. `` Just so,'' responded <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We pour <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.'' <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> notes that 200 years after that purported discussion, the situation is at times reversed. `` The House has begun to act as a check on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he concludes. `` It has now become in many instances the saucer into which <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation is poured to cool it.'' The two volumes lay out the benchmarks of congressional history, high and low, triumph and scandal: The burning of the Capitol by the British in 1814, the expansion of the nation, the march toward Civil War in the 1860s, the end of slavery, the era of reconstruction, the impeachment trial of President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, investigations, the rivalry with the presidency, the depression, world wars, the ethics of congressmen, Watergate. ... Says historian <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of his volume: `` It's a hop, skip and a jump over the mountain tops.''

<HEAD>Americans Eating Their Way to Early Graves, Surgeon General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans are eating their way to early graves, bite by bite and meal by meal, consuming too much fat, seasoning it with too much salt and washing it down with too much alcohol, according to a report issued today by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general. `` Overconsumption of certain dietary components is now a major concern for Americans,'' the report said, noting that `` diseases of dietary excess and imbalance'' are among the leading causes of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many Americans are overweight, do n't eat enough fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and often fail to get required nutrients such as calcium and iron. Of the 2.1 million Americans who died last year, the surgeon general's study said that nearly 1.5 million succumbed to diseases associated with diet. `` What we eat may affect our risk for several of the leading causes of death for Americans, notably, coronary heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and some types of cancer,'' the report said. `` These disorders together now account for more than two-thirds of all deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Though malnutrition is a problem in several parts of the world and for certain Americans, the report said, `` for most of us the more likely problem has become one of overeating _ too many calories for our activity levels and an imbalance in the nutrients consumed along with them.'' In a forward to the report, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said that although many foods are involved, the chief factor affecting health `` is the disproportionate consumption of foods high in fats, often at the expense of foods high in complex carbohydrates and fiber _ such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products.'' He said he is convinced that through `` a concerted effort'' by policy makers and the public, `` our daily diets can bring a substantial measure of better health to all Americans.'' The 712-page report cites more than 2,000 scientific studies from around the world and was compiled with the advice of more than 200 doctors, nutritionists and biochemists. The report makes recommendations ranging from the amount of fat that should be included in the diet, to the advisability of taking vitamin supplements. Among the major findings: _ Most people should reduce the consumption of fat, especially saturated fats, such as from eggs, butter or untrimmed red meat It suggests more vegetables and fruits, fish, poultry, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. _ More whole grain foods, cereal products, vegetables and fruits should be in the diet The report recommends that dried beans and peas be used as a source of protein to replace some animal products. _ Sodium consumption should be reduced by limiting the use of salt in food preparation and at the table _ Alcohol intake should be reduced to two drinks a day `` if at all. Pregnant women should avoid any alcohol, it said. The report estimates that about 9 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> population has two or more drinks a day. _ Fluoride should be added to community water systems to prevent tooth decay, and that the consumption of sugar be limited to avoid dental cavities _ Adolescent girls and women should increase consumption of foods high in calcium, such as low-fat dairy products _ Children, adolescents and women of childbearing age should consume more iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish, cereals, beans and whole-grain cereals `` This issue is of special concern for low-income families,'' the report said. Dietary fat, the report said, increases risks for obesity, some types of cancer, gallbladder and heart disease. `` Dietary fat accounts for about 37 percent of the total energy intake of Americans, well above the upper limit of 30 percent recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' the report said. It said excess cholesterol levels, strongly associated with heart attacks, should be reduced by limiting consumption of foods of animal origin, such as eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry and fish. The report warned against fad diets or `` magical'' foods that often are promoted with unsubstantiated claims. It said Americans spend about $ 2.7 billion a year for nutritional supplements that are `` of unproven benefit.'' Over-the-counter vitamins and minerals, alone, represent a huge business of questionable value, the report said. `` An estimated 40 percent of Americans consume supplemental vitamins, minerals, or other dietary components at an annual cost of more than $ 1.5 billion,'' even though such supplements are not needed by most customers, the report said. Americans also spend extra money for products labeled as `` natural'' or `` organic'', even though the study said special benefits of these products `` are not generally demonstrated.'' `` ` Natural' vitamins, for example, often sell at twice the price of synthetic products even though they are chemically identical,'' the report said. `` In some such products labeled as ` natural', only a minor fraction of the vitamin is actually derived from natural sources.''

<HEAD>Boon for Dairymen Tacked Onto Drought Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Critics of a $ 145 million milk price support increase tacked onto the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> drought-relief bill say it could invite a presidential veto, but the amendment's chief sponsor says it's needed because `` cows do n't drop from the sky.'' Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., says that without the 50-cent price support increase, dairy farmers in his state and elsewhere will reduce the size of their herds, eventually leading to milk shortages Critics produced two studies saying the chances of such shortages are slight, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the milk price-support increase anyway on a 15-12 vote and then sent the drought-relief bill to the full House. `` This amendment makes the whole bill more vulnerable,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan. He said the amendment makes the measure subject to criticism that it treats `` one segment of agriculture more favorably than other segments of agriculture.'' The committee action also came despite a warning from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> against special benefits for favored segments of agriculture. `` Creating windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a letter sent Monday to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, D-Texas. `` To put it very simply, we must not bust the budget,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. As the bill was written two weeks ago, it would have canceled an expected price-support cut of 50 cents for each hundred pounds of milk. The new plan adopted at <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>' urging would not only cancel the reduction but would increase the price-support level by 50 cents per hundredweight to $ 11.10. `` It is the duty of this committee to assure that there is an adequate supply of milk,'' said <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, whose home state is a major source of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>'s milk. He said that without additional help, dairy farmers will reduce their herds and the lost production capability could not be restored overnight. `` Cows do n't drop from the sky,'' <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said. He said that if milk shortages set in, `` you're going to hear screams from consumers that you wo n't believe.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON>, D-Va., presented one study by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and another by private agricultural economists that saw no milk shortage in the offing if the system remains as it is Proponents of the measure, however, shrugged off such studies. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said that because of the drought a 50-cent increase in the price-support level actually is in keeping philosophically with the 1985 farm program, even though it calls for successive 50-cent cuts in supports. <PERSON> Steinholm </PERSON> said higher feed prices, caused by a hay shortage, have been tantamount to a drastic cut in price supports, and that fairness would actually call for a $ 1 increase in supports. At the outset of the committee's session, Deputy Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told lawmakers the administration already disapproved of provisions of the bill that would expand feed programs for dairy and livestock producers. He also said the administration opposes a provision that would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the next two years as a condition of receiving disaster payments now. The measure would provide disaster payments for growers of all crops equal to 65 percent of losses in excess of 35 percent of expected yield. For farmers who lost their entire crops, there would be additional payments. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already has approved its own version of the bill but is struggling to come up with a similar plan to aid farmers whose crops have been all but entirely burned away by the blazing sun and shortage of rainfall that has plagued the midcontinent. Farm senators had planned to meet late Tuesday to work out a formula but canceled the session at the last minute. They still are aiming for floor action this week. Feed benefits for livestock producers would be capped at $ 50,000 for each individual. Payments for crop producers would be limited to $ 100,000 per person. As it was putting the finishing touches on the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated compassion for cotton growers in the district of Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Combest </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, whose crops were damaged last year by hail. The panel approved a $ 24 million amendment that would provide disaster payments to those farmers. Proponents acknowledged that the damage had nothing to do with the drought but noted that there was a similar disaster relief bill in 1986 but none in 1987. They said <PERSON> Combest </PERSON>'s plan would `` fill in the gaps.''

<HEAD>Drought To Have Long-Term Effect On Livestock Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This summer's heat and drought have hurt livestock producers now and for some time in the future, an Agriculture Department analysis says. Meat production in the second half of 1988 will be greater than it otherwise would have been without the drought. And prices received by livestock producers will be down, reflecting the thinning out of herds. `` As producers sell off some breeding stock, the long-term capacity of the industry will be lowered,'' the report said. `` The increased slaughter in 1988 will lower production in 1989 and prices will rise again.'' The report was prepared by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginzel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It was included in a forthcoming issue of Agriculture Outlook magazine. Beef production will be affected by this year's drought in two ways, the report said. First, cattle feedlot operators, who depend on corn and other feed grains, are seeing higher production costs. Second, cow-calf operators, who provide calves to feeders, will be hit the hardest. `` Calves are the major cost in the cattle feeding industry,'' the report said. `` As the price of feed rises, cattle feedlot operators will decrease the price they are willing to pay for feeder cattle.'' Meanwhile, the cow-calf producer's major feed is forage such as pasture and hay. Drought has reduced the forage supply, just as it has the grain inventory. As production of forage is reduced, cow-calf operators are forced to reduce their herds or supplement grazing with hay. `` The first cattle to move off drought-stressed pasture usually are the yearling cattle that normally go into feedlots,'' the report said. `` The next to move are replacement heifers, which were intended to go into the breeding herd, and older, less-productive cows.'' Finally, the last to go are the mature, most productive cows, the basic breeding stock for future beef production. Drought affects hog producers mostly through higher feed costs, the report said. Many hog farmers produce some or all of their feed grains. But as corn yields are reduced, producers will have to buy additional grain or send their hogs to slaughter early. `` Increased culling of the -LRB- hog -RRB- breeding herd boost short-term production and reduces prices received,'' the report said. `` It will also reduce production in 1989. Feeder pig producers are squeezed more than farrow-to-finish hog farmers, much like the cow-calf producers in the beef industry.'' Drought has hit the poultry industry in similar ways, with higher grain and soybean meal prices raising production costs. Broiler production may drop in the second half of 1988 and in 1989, relative to normal output. `` Because broilers have a short production cycle, the broiler industry can respond more quickly to the higher feed costs and can decrease production more quickly than either the cattle or hog industries,'' the report said. It added: `` As with previous droughts, if next year's grain and forage crops are near normal and if grain prices drop and livestock prices soar because production is down, meat production will then become further depressed as profitability improves and as producers hold animals from slaughter to rebuild their breeding herds.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a referendum among hog producers and importers to determine whether a national pork promotion and research program will continue. The vote will be held Sept. 7-8 at county extension offices, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, announced Tuesday. `` All pork producers or persons importing hogs, pork or pork products between Nov. 1, 1986, and Sept. 6, 1988, will be entitled to vote in the referendum,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. `` A simple majority -LRB- one vote more than half the number cast -RRB- will determine if the ... program will continue.'' The 1985 farm law authorized the pork program, which is paid for by an assessment of one quarter of 1 percent of the market value of all hogs sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and an equivalent amount on imported hogs, pork and pork products. A final regulation setting up the program was issued by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 5, 1986, and the assessments began that fall on Nov. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stipulated that for the program to continue in effect a referendum must be held between 24 months and 30 months after the department issued the final regulation.

 Rains have `` relieved drought stress'' in parts of the Corn Belt, but crops have shown little improvement, reports the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility. `` The precipitation gave most crops a boost in the central and southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and Southeast,'' the report said Tuesday. `` Soil moisture improved but was still mostly short in the eastern half of the nation.'' In the central and eastern Corn Belt, rain during the week of July 18-24 may have come too late to improve corn harvest prospects, the report said. Soybeans were reported in `` mostly fair'' condition but showed little improvement as a result of rain in the central and eastern Corn Belt areas, the report said. However, soybeans continued to improve in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, where the crop was reported in `` good to fair'' shape. Livestock was reported in `` mostly fair'' condition and recent rains have helped pastures, although forage was still in short supply.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee says a new outside counsel named to probe allegations against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will be `` free to investigate in any manner he deems appropriate.'' But the counsel, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, will be restricted to looking into the six counts in a complaint adopted by the panel on June 9 and public release of any findings will be controlled by the ethics panel, said chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` If any other evidence comes to his attention, he is directed to report that to us,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday The committee would then decide whether to broaden the investigation, he added. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> and his staff will do independent investigative work, including the taking of large numbers of depositions. The ethics panel, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, will pay <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s law firm up to $ 300,000 plus expenses, he said. `` He is free to investigate in any manner he deems appropriate, whatever he feels is necessary,'' said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` I'm like any other professional lawyer,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> told reporters in a brief introduction outside the closed door of the committee room. `` I'm going to exercise my own judgment within the parameters of the inquiry. ... I've been told to investigate the allegations fully, fairly, completely and thoroughly, and that's what I intend to do. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief accuser, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., complained about the selection of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, noting that he has been an active Democratic fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and had been a delegate to last week's Democratic National Convention, although he sat out the convention and let an alternate take his place <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said he also would have preferred selection of someone with a prosecutorial background. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s 60-lawyer firm handles mostly corporate law and civil litigation. `` It seems to me for this investigation to have any legitimacy it has to be able to follow the leads wherever they lead,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> told reporters. `` The independent counsel has to be truly independent. He can not be on a short leash held by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman of the committee.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the 12-member ethics panel, made up of six Democrats and six Republicans, agreed to seek an outside counsel at the same time it opened its <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> inquiry on June 9, but chose not to make that decision public until someone was found to take the job. `` We believed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public would feel more comfortable, when the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is being investigated, with someone that is not an employee of the Capitol,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> repeated to reporters his contention that he would be exonerated by the probe and said he hoped it would be conducted quickly. `` I think they will conclude I have not violated any commonly accepted ethics rules, and the sooner that happens, the better,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the matter is being used as a political weapon by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who is laying the groundwork to cry foul if the probe turns up nothing critical of the speaker. `` Failing to have any substance on which to rely, they are trying to lay the impression that the inevitable result of a clear bill of health is somehow a whitewash,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. At the same time, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has used <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ethics problems as grist on the campaign trail, was speaking across the street from the Capitol at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and advocating conflict-of-interest laws for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that are as tough as those that now apply to the executive branch, including provisions for a fully independent counsel to investigate ethics cases. The six counts now pending against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> include charges of using his office to lobby federal officials and others on matters in which he had a financial interest, and alleged improprieties in the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high royalties, among other charges.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fire-spitting helicopters were dispatched to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to help protect the Old Faithful geyser area from a 6,000-acre blaze, part of the worst series of fires in the park in nearly a century. Almost 1,000 firefighters were summoned to the scene, but officials had not decided as of early Tuesday evening whether to actively fight the fire, one of a dozen burning in the oldest national park. The fires have charred more than 70,000 acres in the 2.2 million-acre park, the nation's oldest national park. One fire, the 47,000-acre blaze dubbed `` Clover Mist'' on the eastern edge of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, made two jumps into <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> made plans to tour <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> by helicopter Wednesday to get a first-hand view of the devastation. Winds were pushing the Old Faithful fire away from the geyser complex, which includes an historic inn and several other buildings. But fire managers decided as a safeguard to call in `` heli-torches'' that can spew a napalm-like substance. If officials decide to use them, the copters will be used to start `` backfires'' to burn away brush in the main fire's path. The fire, which started Friday in the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, burned roughly 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION>, and about 10-15 miles south of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, said Fire Information Officer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. Later estimated differed on how far the fire was from Old Faithful, ranging from about 6 miles to 10 miles, but officials agreed that it was still burning toward the northeast, a direction would bypass the geyser. Spokesmen stressed that their figures on total acreage burned also were estimates. Officials said they did n't believe firefighters could ever douse the flames. `` These fires are going to burn until the weather puts them out,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. A fire camp was established 13 miles north of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION> in an open field, where resting firefighters relaxed in tents or simply stretched out on the ground. Other firefighters were at Old Faithful picking the area clean of downed trees, piles of firewood, twigs and pine needles that could feed embers carried by winds to the area. They also cleared the ground around a microwave tower that provides Old Faithful's communications with the rest of the park Plans were made to burn a five-mile-long meadow, possibly on Wednesday, to clear out the dry vegetation and thus slow the fire if it turned toward Old Faithful, said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` With the worst-case weather scenario -LRB- strong winds out of the west -RRB-, that probably would n't hold it. But it would definitely slow it down,'' he said. `` If all else fails, we'll backfire Old Faithful.'' Eighty firefighters were sent to an area near <LOCATION> Frost </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, located 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Entrance </LOCATION>, where flames had blackened about 200 acres since the fire moved into the national forest during the weekend, said forest spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>. Another 60 were 10 miles farther to the north where the `` Canoe Lake'' fire had burned about 50 acres, he said. Unusually hot and dry conditions this summer have left <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> tinder-box dry. `` The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the late 1800s,'' said Incident Commander <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplinger </PERSON>. `` The fuel conditions, and the weather conditions, lend themselves to extreme fire potential. `` The outlook is we probably got at least three long months of fire season ahead of us in this part of the country,'' he added. `` We could be in for the beginning of the siege of'88.'' Although no closures of services or accommodations at Old Faithful had been ordered, park visitors were advised such closures may eventually be necessary. Fires have forced the closure of <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and the road from there south to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Entrance </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, about 500 firefighters were continuing to fight flames from the the Shoshone and Red fires that had spread to 20,200 acres. The village includes a small hotel and some trailers and apartments for park service personnel. Hot embers shooting ahead of the fires Monday night burned through power lines at the area of the village and set one building on fire. Officials said the structure was n't seriously damaged. Flames also had burned around the <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> campground, torching trees along the perimeter of the area, according to fire officials. In the Teton Wilderness that borders <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> on the south, some 690 firefighters worked Tuesday along the northern edge of the 24,400-acre Mink Creek fire. While good progress was made during the day on the southern end of the fire, thunderstorms packing some erratic winds were creating a problem on the northern end, which had burned about 1,200 acres into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s remote backcountry.

 Americans looking for a pristine wilderness experience on remote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lands increasingly are finding trashy campsites, unsafe trails, unhealthy water and pollution. And forest service officials recounting these problems also are warning that because of tight money and growing land use, conditions are likely to worsen among the 32 million acres of official wilderness under their control. `` We're falling behind,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, associate <ORGANIZATION> USFS </ORGANIZATION> chief, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> public lands subcommittee on Tuesday in what chairman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., said was the first-ever congressional review of the condition of wilderness areas protected from development under a landmark 1964 law `` Wilderness areas are now literally being loved to death'' by burgeoning numbes of backpackers, some of them ignorant of backcountry etiquette and hygiene, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a ranger from the Superstition Wilderness in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tonto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON>, supervisor for two areas in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Inyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said that overuse there has been countered by setting trailhead quotas and requiring campers to obtain permits. But he said the areas' two rangers are able to contact only 7 percent of the visitors to brief them on backcountry manners and that trail reconstruction is eight years behind schedule, causing safety and erosion problems. <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON> said all visitors are told to purify water before drinking it. And to combat improper sanitation practices by campers, there are now two solar toilets on the popular Mt. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> trail, he said. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fege </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> explains that such toilets are portable enclosures that have solar collectors to generate heat to dry out and compost human waste. <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON> said grazing by pack animals owned by commercial outfitters is nearing the land's grazing capacity and that concentrated use of some campsites `` has left many barren scars on the landscape.'' `` Our efforts to regain some sort of natural condition to these areas have been weak,'' testified <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON>, adding that he's `` had very little success'' in getting forest service support for revegetation efforts. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and the six rangers at the hearing said more money is needed to manage the wilderness areas. <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> agreed, saying that only 32 cents a year is being spent on each wilderness acre, compared to $ 6.39 per acre for general forest service lands. Since 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has doubled the number of wilderness areas to 352. It also has doubled the wilderness budget to about $ 15 million. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said, however, that this `` does n't give us the resources to get ahead.'' The rangers from the field continually emphasized one point: beyond one headquarters job in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, there are no full-time jobs as wilderness rangers and no forest service career track in wilderness management. As a result, there is little overall management planning, considerable turnover among skilled field people and little time for rangers to do much more than keep a cursory watch on the remote acreage under their domain. `` The reality of a person only working five months is that there is little planning time available,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Merigliano </PERSON>, the ranger responsible for the 116,500-acre <ORGANIZATION> Jedediah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. She said that because of tight money, 63 percent of her trail system is substandard and deteriorating. She estimated it would cost $ 162,295 for labor and materials to repair the trails. `` Most of the impacts occurring in the <ORGANIZATION> Jedediah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> result from visitor ignorance of appropriate camping and traveling behavior,'' said <PERSON> Merigliano </PERSON>, adding that she could n't get $ 50 to put together a slide show about proper camping techniques. She said that despite the requirements of the Targhee National Forest Plan, her area lacks an assessment of its campsites. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON>, the ranger for three areas in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said such assessments in her areas found 85 percent of the campsites violating wilderness regulations.

<HEAD>Congress, Pentagon Spar Over Weapons Testing</HEAD>

 The Pentagon has ignored congressional orders to do a better job of testing weapons before it invests in multimillion-dollar programs, says the watchdog arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s 5-year-old weapons testing program still can not adequately assess whether weapons would work in combat, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> review deals with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, which was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 in an attempt to do a more realistic job of testing weapons. The legislation was triggered by the discovery of serious flaws in several major weapons systems after they were well into development. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 140 legislators who banded together in 1981 to seek management changes in the federal government's largest single agency. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., a caucus member, told <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had ignored <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' orders to test weapons `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not depend on the realism of the weapons tests, or the independence of the testing reports we receive,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, appearing at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, said he had n't seen the report and could n't comment on its specifics. But he then went on to criticize what he said is `` an increasing tendency on the part of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to seek <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reviews without giving the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> a chance to review the reports before they are released. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s spokesman, was even more critical. `` The difficulty is that those -LRB- members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- who do not wish to inform themselves, who very carefully guard their ignorance, obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testing programs,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., a co-sponsor of the 1983 legislation, said: `` I am disappointed, but hardly surprised I have never seen evidence of any desire by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> or this administration to make this office work as we in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended it to work.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s test of six major weapons, including the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Aegis air defense. That is the sophisticated tracking system involved in the July 3 shootdown by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> of an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The Pentagon says the ship thought it was firing at an Iranian F-14 and is investigating the incident. The other weapons in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study were the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aquila </ORGANIZATION> drone plane; the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s helicopter improvement program; <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Tomahawk conventional cruise missile; the newest targeting system for the Air Force Maverick missile; and the Air Force LANTIRN system for night-time targeting. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> concluded that there were `` significant problems and limitations in the planning, execution, realism, analysis, and service test agency reporting of the six'' programs. Some of these problems and limitations `` were unavoidable due to time, resource or safety constraints, although numerous others were not.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had n't followed congressional orders to make the tests as realistic and combat-like as possible. For example, `` the prevailing problem for operational users was that they were selected from an operator pool that was atypically high in skill or experience level _ that is, so-called ` golden crews,''' the review said. Another example: In some instances contractors were permitted to help military crews maintain the weapons `` although that contractor support would not be available in the field.'' The problem was compounded by the fact that test data was often misread, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In five of six cases, we found problems with the various assumptions underlying the analyses of the test data. In at least two cases, such assumptions led to overly optimistic estimates of the system's capability, one of which was contracted by available data.'' There were other `` questionable practices'' in interpreting data and their impact `` was significant,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They frequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performance requirements.'' Flaws cited by the report included the fact that crews used for both the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter tests and Maverick tests were specifically trained for the tests, rather than being normal crews; and tests of the Tomahawk occurred only over pre-tested flight routes.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected a demand by Gov. Rose Mofford that he turn over to the state a `` protocol fund'' that figured in his impeachment trial. Instead, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he planned to return the roughly $ 80,000 to those who contributed to it in the first place. The money was raised through ticket sales to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s January 1987 inaugural ball and was originally intended to help pay off some of his campaign debts. But corporations had bought some of the tickets, and state law bars corporate campaign contributions. So <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aides later agreed to treat the money as a kind of `` protocol fund'' to pay for gifts to visitors and similar expenses that state budgets normally do n't cover Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> contend that the agreement turned the fund into state property, and they told <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> last week that he had until the close of business Tuesday to turn over the money or face a civil suit. But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday that he believed his solution was a better one, and spokesmen for Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said the officials were willing to negotiate further before suing. `` We are not champing at the bit to file this suit,'' said <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. `` We want to discuss it with people in the governor's office and Mr. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON>, said the governor `` still is following the advice of the attorney general.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted April 4 by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on impeachment charges, including one that he had misused the state funds when he loaned much of the protocol fund to his car dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> maintained that the money was a private account even though it was being used for state purposes. And he said lending the money to his dealership allowed the fund to garner higher interest than a regular bank account would have earned. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he would fight any suit but would hold off on making refunds for `` a couple of weeks'' to let <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> file suit. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> declined to say why <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> did n't accept the idea of returning the money to the contributors or what compromise his office might approve.

<TEXT>
 Sharp increases in trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> helped push <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign trade up nearly 20 percent in the first half of 1988, officials said today. Spokesman <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiangdong </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference that trade for the period totaled $ 35.85 billion, 19.5 percent above last year's figure He said exports were up 16.1 percent to $ 20.22 billion and imports climbed 24.3 percent to $ 15.63 billion. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign trade is `` stable and healthy'' and `` demonstrated good prospects of a smooth transition from the old system to the new,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is decentralizing controls over its foreign trade and trying to develop export industries while confining imports to machinery and high technology items that will help in the nation's modernization drive `` The unchecked importation of production lines and high durable consumer goods was basically controlled,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. He said that through May, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was $ 2.89 billion, up 26.3 percent from the first five months of 1987. Trade with the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> region totaled $ 7.54 billion, up 35.5 percent. Trade with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was $ 5.49 billion, up 8 percent; with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> $ 3.775 billion, up 3.5 percent; and with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> $ 1 billion, up 32.1 percent, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. The ministry's figures differed from those released this month by the Customs Office, which showed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a trade deficit of slightly more than $ 1 billion on total trade of $ 43.2 billion. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said the two offices have different ways of calculating goods imported and then processed for export. He said his ministry does not include imports of equipment by foreign-funded enterprises that will be used to produce goods for export. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> also said 2,109 foreign-funded enterprises were approved in the first half of the year, an increase of 186 percent over January-June 1987. He said the value of those contracts was $ 2 billion, up 130 percent. Projects funded by investors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> jumped from 34 last year to 85 this year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from 39 to 85, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> from 20 to 36, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from three to 13 and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from three to 10. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> continued to lead foreign investors with 79 percent of projects and 67 percent of money invested.

 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>'s new production of `` Rigoletto'' made a favorable first impression Tuesday night at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, helped by a high caliber of singing. Tenor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leech </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Binghamtom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who played the Duke, has a golden voice and thrilled the audience as he held the last note of his biggest aria. His Duke was more like a heedless college man than a hardened womanizer. It was easy to understand how <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> could stay in love with him even after two betrayals. <PERSON> Leech </PERSON> made his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> debut in 1984 and this year won the <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> and will make his Metropolitan Opera debut. <PERSON> Faith </PERSON> <PERSON> Esham </PERSON>, whose voice is clear and whose presentation is much more lyric than coloratura, was an exceedingly pure but human and agreeable <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchinal </PERSON>, whose baritone is clear and interesting, played a middle-range Rigoletto. His characterization was not passionate, and one did not feel enormously sorry for this Rigoletto when his troubles began, then compounded. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Capobianco </PERSON> devised and directed the production. Some staging innovations work well: Rigoletto's patio in Scene 2 is upstairs on the bedroom level of his house; Act 3 has <PERSON> Sparafucile </PERSON>'s Inn near the front of the stage, which places singers forward, where they can project A bridge indicates the river into which Rigoletto intends to dump the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s body after <PERSON> Sparafucile </PERSON> murders him. The bridge connects to upstairs rooms in the inn. The Duke not only sings from his inn bedroom, making Rigoletto realize he's alive, but casually walks away across the bridge, right in front of Rigoletto, a nice touch. <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Boncompagni </PERSON> conducted the Verdi melodies that dance even while the plot turns tragic.

 The arts are a $ 17 billion-a-year sector of the British economy and one-fourth of the country's tourist income is spent on cultural activity, a non-profit institute reported today. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says the arts account for 2.5 percent of all spending on goods and services in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and directly employ 496,000 people, or 2.1 percent of the work force. `` The Economic Importance of the Arts in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'' says 27 percent of the $ 9.2 billion spent annually by overseas visitors in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is connected to arts attractions. The three-year, four-volume study is being sent to the government, local councils, private business, tourism authorities, arts organizations and private foundations that helped to fund it.

<TEXT>
 Most restaurants in this desert resort serve water on request only, towering hotel-casinos have reduced the flow from thousands of showerheads and a showroom elephant waits longer for her bath to be changed. The drought has come home to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, but its slot machine bells still jangle and chips still fly across its felt gambling tables. In fact, the drought that has stunned the nation's midsection with its severity has n't surprised hotel owners here. After two consecutive years in which the area has received half its scant 7.5-inch annual precipitation, <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> is in a Stage One drought alert, calling for voluntary cutbacks in water use. Stage Two, which mandates some unenforced reductions, is expected by mid-August. Unlike <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> provides more than enough water to the casinos and their shimmering fountains, <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> depends almost solely on runoff from winter snow in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> for its summer water. And the snow is gone. Restaurants, hotel-casinos and other businesses here typically have been watchful of their water use, partly because they pay for every drop. `` Our per-person use is half that of residential consumption,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, chief engineer at the Peppermill Hotel Casino. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> estimates that water-saving conversions at the year-old hotel tower have produced a minimum savings of 3 million to 4 million gallons of water annually for little more than the cost of the time it took to make them. While some hotels here and at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> have installed restricted-flow shower heads and water-saving toilets, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> opted to modify the existing fixtures. `` You do n't have to spend a lot of money,'' he said. `` People go out and buy a lot of gadgets they do n't need.'' He cut back the Peppermill's water use by putting smaller washers in shower heads and reducing pressure in the taps. Lower water levels in hotel toilets cut consumption from 6 gallons per flush to 4, he said. Outdoor watering was decreased by replacing thirsty plants with decorative rocks or vegetation better suited to the desert. At <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ascuaga </PERSON>'s Nugget in nearby <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, all outside plants are watered by drip irrigation installed during the past year, according to spokesman Art Long. The Nugget, like other local hotels, recycles water in air conditioning cooling towers and loads dishwashers completely before starting them. Conservation even has affected <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON>, the Nugget's trained elephant who warms up showroom crowds for entertainers like <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>. `` We used to clean and drain her pool twice a week. Now it's down to once a week And the water that's pumped out is used to water the lawn and foilage around <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON>'s Elephant Palace,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Homeowners, however, successfully fought efforts to require water meters. They pay a flat monthly fee regardless of how much water they use. New homes are required to have water meters, but there still are nearly 50,000 with virtually unlimited water use. `` Hotel-casinos are not the biggest users. I think they take a bad rap,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Firth </PERSON>, water resources manager for <ORGANIZATION> Westpac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>. Businesses use only 22 percent of the 90 million gallons or so his company pumps out daily, <PERSON> Firth </PERSON> said. By comparison, he said, 47 percent of the daily summertime use goes for watering lawns and hedges. The Reno area's last prolonged dry spell was in 1976-77, and even though those years were a little wetter than the past two, `` we got through kind of by the skin of our teeth,'' <PERSON> Firth </PERSON> said. `` The difference between now and 1976-77 is that we've had a 33 percent growth rate,'' <PERSON> Firth </PERSON> said. `` Measures may have to be a lot more drastic than they were at that time.''

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was focusing on state crime and prison issues today before heading out on a three-day campaign swing that will take him to seven states. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was touring a prison construction site, meeting with his anti-crime council and signing legislation imposing stiff penalties on producers and sellers of child pornography before heading home to pack for the campaign trip that begins Thursday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent most of Tuesday tending to state business as well, but took time at an afternoon news conference to blast President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> III even after two <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials quit because of the attorney general's conduct. `` When that happens, I do n't think there are any further questions,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters. `` He's got to go and he's got to go immediately. ... Instead, they continued to defend him and with their support he continued to serve as attorney general.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ pointing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaction in the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> case _ appeared unimpressed with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call Tuesday for new government ethics standards. `` You've got to act,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You do n't need codes. You do n't have to have a book.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to the resignations earlier this year of Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and former Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems had crippled the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had committed felonies. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said they told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of their concerns in April. `` I hope I never have a briefing like the one Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> gave the vice president three months ago,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But if I do, I wo n't sit there and do nothing.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` are embarrassed and ashamed by some of the things that they see'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not trying to block the arms-for-hostages deal at the center of the Iran-Contra affair. `` How can anyone possibly just sit there when someone came up with a proposal so crazy?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's the issue, It's a question of judgment ... You ca n't make deals for hostages. If you do, you better forget about breaking the back of international terrorism.'' He also questioned the viability of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new day-care proposal and scoffed at talk that he was planning to resign to concentrate on his presidential campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week proposed a $ 2.2 billion program that would give tax credits to working mothers, especially those with relatively low family incomes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he supported spending that much for day care, but said that he wanted local governments and private business to pick up some of the tab and that initial funding probably would not be that high. He also criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program as too complicated, saying, `` A policy that would require every welfare mother in the country to hire an accountant just does n't make sense.'' There were renewed rumors in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> this week that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was preparing to resign, but he said he planned to stay on as governor and, if elected, would resign only after being inaugurated as president. He laughed when told that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said Democrats got his `` Irish up'' by criticizing the administration during the Democratic National Convention. `` It's a political season,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We've got 110 days to go and I assume the president will be as political as anyone else.''

<TEXT>
 New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> already has carved out a role for himself in the 1988 presidential campaign _ as a strong, sometimes vindictive attacker of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the Democratic presidential nominee. But <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is under consideration for another supporting role _ that of running mate to Republican nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> himself said Tuesday that he had been asked to fill out the questionnaire being circulated by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign to potential vice presidential picks. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, speaking to reporters here, played down his prospects of being chosen. Asked what the odds were, he said, `` I do n't gamble.'' Even if his chances of being chosen to fill out the ticket are slim, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is likely to be a visible player in the coming general election campaign. He has been described by Democrats as a hit man with a venonmous tongue. Supporters say he just presents the facts. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, calls <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> a `` rattlesnake ... out of the rocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> says, `` If you do n't have a strong swing with a 2-by-4, you do n't get attention.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and one of five co-chairmen of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, is in demand as an interviewee, according to aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>. He describes his boss as an entertaining speaker with a good sense of humor who gets his message across. `` When the governor gets done speaking, you're going to understand what he's saying. You many not agree, but you will understand,'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said. `` No one falls asleep listening to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was credited with helping boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary _ a crucial race, especially after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s third-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor has had a ringside seat for the six years of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' economic transformation. But he derides <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' description of a `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle,'' instead calling it the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Mirage.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> maintains that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> appears prosperous when viewed from outside the region, but that business indicators do not compare favorably with the rest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, especially <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is an expert at the theater of politics,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says. `` He has a superb veneer. That's the whole point. Once you cut through that veneer there's not much there.'' He also has attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on issues including education, mental health care and pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> harbor. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, 49, who lives in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> border and taught at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before becoming governor, plays up the state rivalry that heated up in the 1970s. `` The best way to kill something in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is to say this is the way <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> does it,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s aide <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has not been surprised by the fervor of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s attacks, spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself has seldom responded to the attacks. `` Normally, we ignore it, but we point out the facts,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. The biggest clash between <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is over the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant, located on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> seacoast about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> worked with the nuclear industry before his three terms as governor and is a strong proponent of nuclear power and <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' refusal to cooperate on an evacuation plan for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities within <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s emergency zone has been a major obstacle to licensing the plant. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> prevented <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> from doing what <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> did n't want done _ that's ramming <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> through, which is his mission in life as governor,'' said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. Some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> partisans suggest <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is a bit envious of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his growing stature in national politics. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' popularity in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> might rankle. An offbeat poll of 400 voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> during the 1986 gubernatoral race gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 47 percent, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> 37 percent, in a hypothetical race for governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> news media sponsored the survey, conducted by a <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, polling firm. Former <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` could not in any way be characterized as a personal vendetta. `` It's a competition basically between two strong managers,'' she said. The two remain cordial in public and have found common ground on issues such as raising the drinking age to 21 and fighting acid rain. <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant, acknowledged that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s practice of `` firing with both barrels'' could backfire, but said it is not yet a concern of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, deputy press secretary for the vice president's campaign, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp will continue to pay for <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s appearances around the `` He's been an enormously effective surrogate,'' she said, `` not only advocating <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy and ideas, but also a very effective spokesman on the record of Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.''

 More than 500 people were evacuated Tuesday night when a forest fire swept through rural subdivisions west of the city, burning four outbuilding and threatening homes. The fire, reported about 3 p.m. Tuesday, had grown to about 600 acres by 10 p.m. MDT and was expanding rapidly, said <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, fire information officer for the state Division of Forestry. Fifteen volunteer fire departments brought 25 engines to the scene where 175 firefighters struggled to protect the homes. Some 260 more firefighters were expected to arrive during the night, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` As the fire passes one area the engines are moving ahead and trying to get ahead of the fire,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. The fire forced the evacuation of four subdivisions and homes along a three-mile stretch of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Highway 4. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> described the area as mostly forest with some meadows. Homes were scattered among the timber and the clearings, he said. Four helicopters were dropping water and a slurry bomber was delivering fire retardant to protect the homes, he said. Four bulldozers were working to dig a fire line around other buildings. He said there was no chance the fire would be contained Tuesday night, although the wind was light. `` The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it creates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind by sucking in oxygen,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. Most of those evacuated found lodging with friends and relatives, said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> Chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. About 60 families responded to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appeal for people to open their homes to those who were evacuated, he said. `` We're spending more time now coordinating between family members to let people know where they're staying,'' he said. Some families were separated in the confusion of the evacuation, he said. In some cases people returned to get pets and free horses from their pens in advance of the fire and became separated when authorities would n't let them take the same route back out, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the cause of the fire was under investigation.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of a $ 388 million bill to combat hunger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could spark similar action in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says. `` When they see the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can do this with such a heavy, heavy vote, it just could push them to action,'' Agriculture Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said Tuesday after the bill won 89-7 approval He said the bill would `` make a dent'' in the problem of hunger if it became law and that it would `` help a lot of people who are not going to be helped otherwise.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> called for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval, citing estimates that in 1986 there were 32 million Americans living in poverty, 85 percent of them women, children, the handicapped and the elderly. The bill was opposed by the administration on budget grounds. It would cost $ 388 million next year and spending would expand to $ 667 million in 1991, by administration calculations. Nonetheless, only token opposition materialized. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, was prepared to offer three amendments designed to reduce the costs. But the first one failed 81-14, and he decided to drop the other two. The bill would reauthorize the <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- TEFAP -RRB- for two years at a level of $ 50 million each year for administrative costs. It also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to buy $ 145 million worth of high-protein food each year for distribution to the needy. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s amendment would have subtracted from the $ 145 million the value of any surplus crops distributed to the poor. Government economists are expecting a substantial surplus of corn in government stocks at year's end despite the drought plaguing the Corn Belt. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said he lobbied hard against <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s proposals in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, describing them as `` killer amendments'' that would scuttle the bill. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the top Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was a co-sponsor of the legislation and pushed hard for it. Provisions of the bill would increase food-stamp benefits and substantially broaden eligibility. It would require the department to buy $ 40 million in additional commodities each year for distribution through soup kitchens, food pantries and emergency feeding centers. These outlets for the most part provide meals to the homeless. Seven million pounds of cheese would be allocated to a commodity supplemental food program. The federal reimbursement rate for school breakfasts would be increased by 3 cents, and federal reimbursement for a number of food-aid programs for children would be expanded. For example, an additional meal or snack would be served to children who stay in day care centers for more than eight hours while parents are working. The measure would provide a child-care deduction of up to $ 160 a month to enable parents to work or receive education and job training.

<HEAD>Judge Facing Impeachment Calls Self `Real Warrior'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> says he's in a `` fighting mood'' despite a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's recommendation for his impeachment, and predicts the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not remove a `` real warrior'' from office. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> swiftly proclaimed his innocence and his optimism Tuesday after three separate votes of 32-1 sent 17 articles of impeachment to the full House. That action by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sets the stage for an unprecedented impeachment proceeding. House concurrence by a simple majority, as early as next week, would lead to the first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial of a federal judge who was acquitted of the same charges in a criminal case. Also, never before has <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> held an impeachment trial for a black official. Several committee members said before voting that racism may have played a part in the initial charges, but all eventually agreed the evidence nonetheless supported the allegations. According to the impeachment articles _ similar to an indictment _ <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> `` engaged in a corrupt conspiracy to obtain $ 150,000'' from two brothers who were defendants before <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, in return, was supposed to impose sentences which would not require prison time. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 51, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge, also was accused of lying at his trial on specific aspects of the conspiracy, of leaking wiretap information in an apparently unrelated case, and of `` bringing disrepute'' on the federal judiciary. `` I'm in a fighting mood,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after the vote. `` There's no way to remove a real warrior. I still do n't think I'll be removed from office. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` acted in blind ignorance'' because the findings of its investigative subcommittee have not been printed. If the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> follows the committee lead, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said, members will vote `` in even blinder ignorance.'' The House only need vote by simple majority to send the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for trial, but senators must vote by a two-thirds margin to convict. Eleven cases have reached an impeachment trial in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and five officials have been removed _ all federal judges. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> was ousted in October 1986 in the last impeachment case. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote in the <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> case was preceded by trial testimony before a special impeachment committee. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., suggested that the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hear testimony in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' case because of the unprecedented prior While <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted of the bribery charges, Borders was convicted in verdicts that lawmakers called inconsistent. In Tuesday's committee votes, Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., opposed all but one of the impeachment articles, while <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., opposed one of the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who is white, and <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, who is black, were among those describing their inner turmoil because of fears that racism was involved in the case. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has known the outspoken <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> for years, said, he `` can not shake the feeling'' that `` there was a bit of racism involved.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, however, that racism could not be the `` sole motivation'' for the allegations, because there were `` too many unique circumstances that ca n't be explained away by coincidence.'' <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, a former city judge in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said anyone denying racism in the case `` closes his eyes to conditions that still exist.'' But the lawmaker said the issue is whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is `` competent to sit in judgment of his fellow man and brings credit to the judiciary.'' He said any judge who allowed himself to become involved in such a case `` is too dumb to sit in judgment of anyone.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee that investigated <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, gave an extensive account of the evidence and admitted he initially wondered if `` racism could be the source'' of the charges. But <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who said he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to remedy racism in the judiciary, said he looked `` for a scintilla of evidence of racism'' and `` could n't find any.'' `` Black public officials must be held to the same standard as all other public officials,'' he said.

Neighbors call <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanka </PERSON>'s overgrown front yard an eyesore; he calls it a `` natural meadow and wildflower preserve.'' `` To a golf course owner, they're weeds,'' said <PERSON> Hanka </PERSON>, whose art specializes in nature scenes. `` I see it as beautiful and I see it as something becoming increasingly beautiful.'' But many of the neighbors who have complained to city officials since <PERSON> Hanka </PERSON> moved in in March 1987 say the half-acre, weed-infested lot is becoming increasingly ugly. At a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> meeting Monday night, <PERSON> Hanka </PERSON>'s next-door neighbor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> said the yard was `` totally unkempt'' and hurting property values. City Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> told the commissioners the lawn's weeds and vegetation constitute a violation of the city's weed ordinance and are a potential fire hazard <PERSON> Hanka </PERSON>, however, said he has spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours planting and weeding. Nonetheless, he was notified by the city this month that if he did n't mow his lawn the city would perform the task and bill him for it. The commission has since backed down from that stand, and directed the city attorney to come up with an amendment to the weed ordinance that would permit such wildflower meadows in the city. The commission will then vote on the amendment. `` It's all comes back to that beauty is in the eye of the beholder,'' said <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, chairman of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>

 For most lottery winners, the pressure's off once they pick their numbers But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> had to race to claim a $ 15.3 million prize he won and failed to collect a year ago. <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, were at the state Capitol Tuesday to claim a $ 15.3 million lottery prize they won with a ticket purchased with $ 20 he found at a shopping mall last July. The couple said they came within a few hours of forfeiting the prize because <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> tossed the ticket into a drawer at home and did n't check the numbers from the July 15, 1987, drawing. Under lottery regulations, the prize money was scheduled to return to the state treasury if the winning ticket was not turned in by the close of business on July 15, 1988. Just a few hours before the deadline, <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> read a <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> story about the missing ticket and recognized the numbers as those he always played _ his birthday, his wife's birthday and one other number he likes Mrs. <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, 65, a retired portrait artist, remembered her husband yelled, `` That's my number! That's my number!'' and raced into the bedroom in search of the ticket. Then the pair drove the three hours to <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> at high speed. `` Sometimes I check them, sometimes I do n't,'' added <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, 70, a retired food company manager. `` But I never throw them away.'' Later, as he held up the check representing the state's first payment, <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> joked, `` This wo n't go in a drawer.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> begins today his first solo campaign trip since receiving the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination, ranging from his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> stronghold to stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and deep South. Drawing on his record as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> plans to speak today before a businesswomen's group in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, three days after Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revealed his plan for a child-care tax cut before the same group <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in an interview on Tuesday, said he was skeptical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach. `` I do n't know what the cost would be,'' he said. The senator said he would highlight his accomplishments in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> including prenatal and child care legislation. From that appearance, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to fly to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for a speech before a labor group, and to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to address state legislators. After another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> stop, in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, he planned to go to <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for a home-state rally in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponent <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>'s hometown. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman, is running for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is running for both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the vice presidency, as he is allowed to do under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law. After the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> stop, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will continue on to either <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday. The 67-year-old senator ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, and he says this national campaign wo n't be that different from what he's accustomed to. `` It'll be just as if I was running for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` You know, it's a pretty good-size state, 254 counties. `` I'm sure I'll be spending more time in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but not exclusively so,'' he said, citing energy states outside of that area as places he also plans to visit. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has long been an advocate for oil and gas interests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaigned last weekend with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, introducing him in most cases. The two men differ on many issues, with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> usually taking a more conservative position. For example, he favors school prayer, new Pentagon weapons, and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. As <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> headed off to stump alone, he was not expected to point up those disagreements. `` I'm not going to go through this campaign worrying about that,'' he said. He and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agree on expanding education and health care, and on many economic issues. `` I'm delighted with his reaction to my discussions on trade. I'll be hitting that issue often,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is currently nursing a trade bill through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed an earlier version, which also included a provision requiring 60 days' notice for plant closings. `` I think we'll get it through before the Republican convention,'' he said. He and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have discussed how <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s experience on trade matters could be put to use if they win in November, but the senator said he did n't want to find his role as vice president restricted that way. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he does n't expect to see much more of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the campaign trail, since the two can cover much more territory traveling separately. But he insists they got along well during their three-day cross-country tour after last week's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> `` He's an easy fellow to get to know. I'd heard all these stories about him being distant, but I did n't find that the case at all,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the plastics industry are opposing attempts to outlaw plastic six-pack holders in favor of yokes made of biodegradable materials, a change that environmentalists say would protect wildlife. Administration and industry officials told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittee Tuesday that more research is necessary to determine what impact the by-products of a degradable holder would have on marine life. But the environmentalists say legislation is needed quickly to save seabirds and marine mammals that are killed by the discarded plastic rings. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manville </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a biologist for Defenders of Wildlife and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Entanglement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said plastic six-pack containers can remain in the environment for `` hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,'' killing wildlife that become entangled and choke to death, or mistake the yokes for food and strangle or die from starvation. `` The six-pack ring epitomizes the plastic pollution problem _ a highly successful product that is functional and durable, and yet ugly and deadly when improperly discarded,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation But <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowrance </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s solid waste division, warned that the proposed law has `` the potential for replacing one problem with another.'' And she noted that even degradable yokes can stay in the environment for several months before breaking down. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, deputy assistant director at the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency opposes the legislation because `` we do not have information that indicates six-pack yokes are a major threat to fish and wildlife resources.'' `` They probably are not a major threat to wildlife population,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Environmentalists disagreed with that assertion and urged immediate action. `` Enough is enough,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>. `` When is there sufficient information? `` The majority of what is seen and reported involves animals on shore. These reports probably represent only a fraction of what is entangling fish and wildlife on the open oceans.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produced 10 million tons of plastic waste in 1986, about 7 percent of the 158 million ton total, according to <PERSON> Lowrance </PERSON>. Projections show the plastic trash total rising to 16 million tons by the turn of the century. The bill by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in May and is pending before <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>' subcommittee and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and tourism. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the commerce subcommittee, said `` there may be reason to question the need for congressional action'' in light of states' responses. Sixteen states have enacted similar laws, beginning with <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> in 1976.

<HEAD>86 Percent of US Treatment Plants Meet Standards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Eighty-six percent of the nation's sewage treatment plants met the July 1 deadline for complying with federal standards, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today. The agency said 309 plants or 2 percent of the 15,486 public treatment works in the nation have been referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or state counterparts for court action to force compliance. Another 9.5 percent are either under court or agency orders to comply according to an agreed schedule. This means 95 percent of the nation's sewage flowing through treatment plants is treated to remove 90 percent of the contaminants, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The July 1 deadline originally was set in 1972 for 1977, but was extended twice. The last extension by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> empowered <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to grant extensions beyond July 1, 1983, only if changed construction conditions beyond control of the municipality or reductions in federal aid made compliance impossible. Of the 423 plants serving more than 10,000 people that did not meet the deadline, 203 have started construction, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. After July 1, no more extensions can be granted unless a community can prove it was physically or financially impossible to meet the deadline. Several court decisions have held that unavailability of federal aid is no excuse for not meeting the standards. Since 1984, the federal goverment has filed 125 lawsuits against municipalities to force compliance. The Clean Water Act requires all public treatment plants to achieve so-called `` secondary'' treatment, that is, bacterial treatment that removes more than 90 percent of the pollutants. Non-complying plants often use only `` primary'' treatment, or filtration and temporary retention in tanks for solids to settle to the bottom. Six hundred fifty plants also are required to use advanced treatment to remove nutrients such as phosphorous or toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, and of these, 525 are in compliance. Since 1972, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has distributed $ 45 billion in federal aid for sewage plant construction, with state and local governments putting up $ 15 billion. Grants in recent years have been running more than $ 2 billion for the federal government's share of construction costs, now 55 percent. But by the early 1990s the program will have been converted to a system of revolving loan funds run by the states.

<TEXT>
 Farmers, equipment suppliers and bankers eagerly await $ 6 billion in prospective drought relief for a depressed farm economy that was just beginning to recover when Nature pulled out the rug. Without the aid, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s financial future could be grim. The farmer estimates that the drought has cut his corn production by at least 40 percent, and he is n't certain yet how much damage it has done to his soybeans. `` Some bills are due in the fall, and next spring we'll have another whole round of them,'' said <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, who farms 1,300 acres with his father and brother in northeastern Illinois' <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> In parched central Illinois, banker <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON> thinks the aid would ease loan repayment problems. Farm equipment dealer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Duitsman </PERSON> hopes it would slow a sales slump. And grain elevator manager <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> believes it could help his fertilizer business. `` Many farmers will have significantly less income from grain sales because of the drought, and that can have a domino effect,'' said <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Champaign-Urbana </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he gets benefits from a federal program, he will have that much more money to pay for other things.'' On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a drought relief bill totaling $ 6 billion, including $ 145 million pushed by dairy-state lawmakers for milk producers. The bill is expected this week on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitze </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> farm policy specialist, said the public realizes agriculture has `` been through a wringer and is just beginning to work its way out.'' `` Now, an act of God pulls out the rug,'' said <PERSON> Spitze </PERSON>. `` I think if we'd just been through six years of prosperity, there would be less willingness to help.'' <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON> said federal drought aid could help farmers pay their bank loans on time, where drought losses otherwise would have left many unable to repay the banks at the usual rate. <PERSON> Duitsman </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Shaff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Implement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>, hopes the federal disaster money also might encourage some farmers to replace aging equipment. `` Since this drought, our sales have dropped off to nothing,'' said <PERSON> Duitsman </PERSON>, who sells tractors, combines and tillage equipment. `` Farmers were just getting back on the road to financial recovery and this hit. They'll be set back unless they get some help from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>, manager of Grain Prairie Coop, said the aid to farmers will not help the grain elevator business in 1988 because `` volume is the name of the game.'' But he said any extra money farmers receive could help the company's fertilizer sales. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Reifsteck </PERSON>, who farms 1,300 acres in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said drought had severely damaged his corn. His problems worsened this week with a thunderstorm that dumped hail on his fields, damaging the soybeans. Hail insurance will cover only his cost of production, he said. `` Any help we get will be greatly appreciated,'' said <PERSON> Reifsteck </PERSON>. `` But, we've tightened our belt in the past and now it will be a notch or two tighter.'' But <PERSON> Reifsteck </PERSON> said no matter how <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> decide to distribute drought aid, some farmers will feel slighted. And <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said he worries that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might go overboard. `` It's easy in a campaign year to overspend,'' he said. `` There is nothing that would hurt the country more than doing that and increasing the national debt.''

 Doctors had told <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> to expect a big baby, but their 10-pound estimate was n't even close. Her newborn son, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, tipped the scales at 13 pounds, 6 ounces. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, born Sunday, is off the chart at the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, which only goes up to 11 pounds, 1 ounce. He's already wearing medium-size diapers and scrunching to fit into a cradle. `` We were pretty surprised,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The nurses were saying to my husband ` Did you do this?''' Mrs. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said she feels fine and is looking forward to taking her son home today. The newborn, 24 \ inches long and about the size of a 3-month-old, was a star attraction at the hospital `` We had quite a few extra visitors wanting to see the baby,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwell </PERSON>, a nurse on duty the night <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> was born. `` Other nurses on break, other moms who had just had babies ... everyone wanted to see him.'' The boy is the fifth child for <PERSON> Apolonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, 30, and his wife, 27, of <LOCATION> Altamonte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The baby was four days overdue and delivered naturally, unusual for a baby his size. `` He has to be pretty close to the world record for a vaginal delivery,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, who delivered <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>. The 1988 Guinness Book of World Records has no such category. It says the two heaviest viable babies weighed 22 -LCB- pounds at birth. Mrs. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> and her husband, a construction worker, have two other sons and two daughters, ages 3 to 11. Their 3-year-old son was nearly 11 pounds at birth.

 Workers in the private sector who should be honored for reporting activities that endanger public health or safety are instead being intimidated into silence, says the sponsor of a bill designed to increase protection for whistleblowers. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> labor subcommittee, said Tuesday that workers who help avert disaster by reporting dangerous practices should be honored as heroes. `` Instead, in too many cases, they are treated like pariahs,'' said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Democrat. `` Their reward is to be fired, harassed, demoted or blacklisted for telling the truth.'' Several workers who lost their jobs after bringing alleged safety problems to light told the subcommittee that more protection is needed for whistleblowers. Former poultry worker <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> charged that practices by <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> during her six years of employment at the company's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, plant constituted a serious public health threat. She said chicken parts were left for months on trailers used to haul live chickens to the plant. `` I observed live haul trailers arriving at the plant loaded with live chickens covered with maggots,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also charged that the birds were rinsed with water at such high pressure that chicken manure was forced into the meat. She said the process was changed to a chlorine solution rinse that peeled the skin from the workers' hands. Ms. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said that after plant officials saw her talking with federal inspectors, she was placed in more stressful jobs, developed severe tendinitis in her hands and arms, and was discharged for accumulating excessive disciplinary points. In April 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued an order requiring <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> to comply with an intensified federal inspection program at the plant. Service spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the company was taken off the intensified program last February. Simmons President <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the company does not deserve the accusations. `` We are very proud of our plant,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` We have a lot of internal controls to see that good sanitary conditions are maintained.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> told the subcommittee that in 1982 he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a quality control inspector at the <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Nuclear Generating Station in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Masters contended that in late 1983 and early 1984 he discovered that pieces of structural steel may not have been installed or might have been below specifications in a building designed for the handling of nuclear fuel. In February 1984, he said, he started to write the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> about the problem. `` My superiors saw what I was doing, took the steel erection prints from me and went into the back room with the prints,'' he told the subcommittee. `` They then falsely marked up the prints to make it appear the inspections had been done when in fact they had not.'' Masters said he was laid off in August 1984 after a campaign of intimidation and harassment by his superiors. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Koerper </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> extensively explored any allegations of construction problems at the plant prior to issuing a license in June 1985. <PERSON> Koerper </PERSON> said further comment would be inappropriate because Masters has filed a lawsuit against the utility. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill would create a uniform definition of protected whistleblower activity for private-sector employees and give them 180 days to file a complaint. It would also extend federal protection to whistleblowers in the aviation, maritime, pharmaceutical, food processing or consumer goods industries. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, assistant secretary of labor for employment standards, said the department has some serious questions about the bill, including its `` extremely broad reach,'' but the agency is still reviewing the measure.

 Playboy empire founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, whose magazine described him as living by the motto `` Marriage is the death of hope,'' has proposed to the most recent of his companions at the Playboy mansion. The object of <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s affections is <PERSON> Kimberley </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 24, the magazine's Miss January 1988 who moved into the mansion in January, along with her two dogs, <PERSON> Leilynd </PERSON> and Dior, and a cat named Spooky. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> has indeed popped the question Saturday night at a romantic moment over the wishing well at the Playboy mansion,'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Binkow </PERSON> said Tuesday evening. No wedding date has been set, he said. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, 62, is quoted in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s August issue as saying: `` I've always felt that my life was rather like a movie. But my relationship with <PERSON> Kimberley </PERSON> is better than any script ... `` She's open, sincere and straight _ just what I need at this point in my life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, whose picture appears on the cover of the issue, said the fact that <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> is 38 years older than her does n't concern her `` I adore him,'' she said. The article, `` The Great Palimony Caper,'' said <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> `` has lived by <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s law: `` Marriage is the death of hope.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> married <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in 1949; the couple had two children including daughter <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, now president of the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> business empire. Since his divorce more than 30 years ago, <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> has advocated the free-swinging lifestyle that came to be known as the `` Playboy philosophy.'' Ms. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> but grew up in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, began her relationship with <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> shortly after his split from his longtime companion <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, another Canadian model. Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s 1983 cover girl, earlier this year attempted to bring a $ 35 million palimony action against <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> after their affair soured, saying he had promised to marry her and father her child. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, who said the lawsuit was a publicity stunt, countered with a $ 1 million cross complaint. She later dropped her lawsuit as did <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> moved into the mansion in 1983 when she was 19, succeeding <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON>, who had also dreamed of being Mrs. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, according to the Playboy article. `` Marriage?'' Ms. <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON> recalled in the article. `` We joked about it. If he wanted something from my side of the bed, I'd tell him, ` Sure, I'll hand it over if you marry me.' <PERSON> Hef </PERSON> getting married was such an absurd idea _ we thought it was funny.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told fellow Cubans to get ready to welcome troops home from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> because a settlement is near in the 13-year Angolan civil war. `` We really are on the threshhold of a political solution,'' he said Tuesday in a three-hour speech marking the 35th anniversary of the start of the revolution that overthrew right-wing dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also said Soviet-style economic and political reforms are not in store for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which he said is improving its economic performance through greater worker discipline. The revolutionary leader said Cuban troops can now leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> because they have been victorious on the battlefield but will remain `` until the last minute'' _ when a peace agreement is signed. `` It ca n't be abrupt,'' he said. `` If the agreement is achieved, if the agreement is signed, we will proceed to the total withdrawal of the internationalist force from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' The governments of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reached an agreement this month for the removal of foreign troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for bordering <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the South Africa-administered territory also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Cuban troops are helping <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government battle rebels of the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which is backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The agreement provides no timetable, and another round of talks is scheduled for August. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said he could n't discuss details of the agreement, but he said it provides for the security of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has sent up to 15,000 more soldiers to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since last fall to bolster the 40,000 Cuban troops already there. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said reinforcements were needed because of events beyond Cuban control. He did not say how many reinforcements were sent, but that they were `` all the troops necessary to solve that situation.'' `` Our objective was not a military victory but a political, just solution to the conflict,'' he said. The Cuban leader's speech on the anniversary of his failed attempt to take the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> garrison in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, generally is considered his most important of the year <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, in his full beard, green uniform and cap, gesticulated often and frequently touched the array of microphones in front of him. His voice occasionally went hoarse, but he held the audience's attention throughout Officials said more than 200,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s Plaza <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceo </PERSON> for the speech Comparing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said: `` Each must have the right to do that which is convenient for it to do. It would be totally incorrect for us to copy mechanically the solutions of other countries.'' He said that despite <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s unwillingness to embrace Soviet-style reforms, there is no tension between <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which supplies <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with military and other aid. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> rejected suggestions from the West that socialist countries must adopt free-market policies to move their societies forward. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will never adopt methods, styles, nor philosophies, nor idiosyncracies of capitalism,'' he said, calling such methods `` complete trash.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s `` rectification'' campaign, designed to eliminate absenteeism and other labor inefficiencies, is starting to produce results. Two years ago, he said lax work habits threatened to make <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> a nation of freeloaders. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has since abandoned economic incentives aimed at boosting production and instead emphasized greater worker discipline at a time when other socialist governments are introducing free-market reforms, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s one-party political system would not change. He said the country has no room for `` pocket parties'' or opposition groups. `` The -LRB- Communist -RRB- party is the one responsible for our country. Here there is only one party,'' he said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said a tragedy of the Third World is that so many dream of easy life in capitalist countries. `` It's a dream, it's an illusion,'' he said. `` It's necessary to work and to work hard. Although the attack on the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> in 1953 failed, the brutality with which it was suppressed helped muster support for the revolution that eventually led to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s triumphant march into <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Jan. 1, 1959. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> frequently referred in his speech the upcoming 30th anniversary celebration of the revolutionary victory.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said it will make `` no deals'' with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> offered to use its influence to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> releases Iranian assets frozen in this country. `` I am not willing to make anything that sounds like a deal,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday, the same day the proposal was aired by <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of the Iranian parliament, in a television interview. `` We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far as we are concerned you just ca n't link the two,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` No deals.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it is `` interesting that there should be this series of statements,'' but `` the clearest signal they could send is to release the hostages.''

 It may not be <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'68, but since the <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auxiliary </ORGANIZATION> was disbanded by six `` whippersnappers,'' generation gap tensions have been flaring up at bingo. `` We're not going to leave. We're going to fight for what's ours,'' auxiliary President <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said Tuesday, a day after leading an eight-woman picket line outside the firehouse as 50 people played bingo inside `` If my husband ever did this to me, he'd be dead meat,'' she said. Six members of the suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> fire department voted July 6 to disband the ladies auxiliary on grounds that the women were difficult to get along with, did not provide coffee and soda to firefighters at fires and did not include firefighters' wives or girlfriends in their membership. `` I've been down here every Monday night. I've been in the kitchen. I've baked. Why, after 40 years, do we have to be thrown out like that?'' asked Mrs. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, 75. `` It makes me sick to think that all these years there's only six whippersnappers, I'd call them, that can vote us out,'' said <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 74, an auxiliary member for 22 years. The all-woman auxiliary had 13 members _ many elderly, 10 of them widows, and none the wives of active firefighters. Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, at 38, said she is the youngest member. `` What woman at 70 years old wants to go out in the middle of the winter and the middle of the night to give men coffee and soda?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> asserted. `` But they did it. They did serve the men coffee and food, but not in the last three, four or five years.'' `` We're going to have a fire auxiliary ... not a ladies auxiliary, so anybody can join. If anybody wants to come down, we'll give them an application,'' said department President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, who said he did not vote on the matter. During the last eight years alone, the women said, they raised $ 25,000 for the department through bingo games and craft bazaars. <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said the money helped pay for a storage room, a plot of land to be used as a parking lot, tables and chairs, a water fountain and other items. `` We do n't even have a room of our own,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` They let us use the kitchen if we're lucky. They figure that's where we should be We're not even allowed through the front door.'' On Monday night, the women carried signs reading, `` Six Members Unfair to Women'' and `` Old Ladies Raised $ 25,000 1980-1988.'' `` We've been very nice,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` We did n't want to stop anyone from going in.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the auxiliary has sought help for a possible lawsuit against the firefighters from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, a legal services organization for the elderly and a local lawyer. But, she said, the women probably will not sue if it will cost them money. The group wants an apology because, she said, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> called them `` older ladies.'' `` We do not want to go back,'' she said. `` But we do want to know when this new organization is formed that these women and members do have rights and -LRB- are -RRB- not to be governed by the men.''

<HEAD>Cuba Trying To Triple Tourism Income By 1991</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, whose colorful casinos and risque nightclubs drew an annual 250,000 tourists to the country before the 1959 revolution, has launched a crash program designed to triple tourism income by 1991. `` Our country really needs foreign exchange,'' <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sed </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Tuesday. `` There is reality _ the economic situation that our country faces is very difficult.'' He said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> hopes to increase the annual number of tourists from 220,000 _ 193,000 of them from non-communist countries _ to 600,000 by 1991. Sed Perez said tourism could bring in more than $ 500 million a year, second only to sugar as a source of foreign exchange, from its current level of fourth place and $ 117 million. Before the revolution brought <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to power, most of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s annual 250,000 tourists were Americans. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s Communist government later took pride in announcing the elimination of such social vices as prostitution. <PERSON> Sed </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is not worried that increased tourism could encourage a return of vice or bring in bad influences from foreign capitalist nations. `` There is no worry,'' he said. `` We do n't see tourism development as something negative.'' He said there are no restrictions on movement of foreign visitors in the island. <PERSON> Sed </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said 39,000 people now work in the tourist industry and training programs will be established to meet the demand for new personnel. The program calls for 12,000 hotel rooms available for foreign tourists by 1991, up from 7,500 now. The most ambitious expansion plans are in <LOCATION> Varadero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s northern coast, where 8,000 rooms will be added to 2,800 now available. <PERSON> Sed </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> now has 50 percent fewer rooms than before the revolution. He said one phase of the plan calls for reopening 16 hotels shuttered or used for other purposses since the revolution, many of them in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, to recover 1,600 rooms. A second phase is to refurbish such existing hotels as the <ORGANIZATION> Habana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libre </ORGANIZATION>, once the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, where the elevators are notoriously slow and the air conditioning extremely weak. A third phase will be building new hotels, including a second tower at the <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, the only hotel built in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> since the revolution, <PERSON> Sed </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. He said three or four hotels might be built in a joint enterprise with a Spanish company, but he provided no details. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> will be among the areas to be included in the tourism expansion. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> visited the brand-new Hotel Bucanero outside the city during activities leading up to Tuesday's celebration of the 35th anniversary of the start of the revolution. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> pronounced it `` magnificent'' and said it was an example of what could be done in the industry. But some staffers, most notably in the restaurant, are clearly new and ill at ease in handling large tables. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said Tuesday in his anniversary speech that tourism could help make up for low market prices for its leading export products, notably sugar and petroleum from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is resold by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He said the marvels of nature on the island and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s sunshine can be sold. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also criticized what he called `` petite bourgeoisie'' in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> who complain because the new hotel rooms are destined first for foreign visitors bringing badly-needed foreign exchange. He noted that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s lobster catch is exported for revenues used to purchase imports of powdered milk. `` There are no children starving to death in this country,'' he said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s No. 1 source of tourists currently is <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with 50,000 visitors a year, followed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens are restricted by their own government.

The kingdom, a longtime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customer, has been prevented from buying some American sophisticated weapons because of the pro-Israeli lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which has claimed the sales would threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. Sales agreements this year reportedly could make <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the No. 1 arms supplier for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, replacing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Fahd's statement was the most direct indication <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> will consider buying arms from the Soviet bloc and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the absence of diplomatic ties between the Islamic kingdom and what it considers atheistic countries. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, in the first step of its kind with a communist nation, has acquired medium-range missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in a deal negotiated over two years, according to reports earlier this year by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. Fahd made the declaration in an address Monday night to army officers in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> for the annual pilgrimage known as the hajj and the four-day Moslem feast of Eid al-Adha.

 A woman who tried to stage a killing to divert suspicion from Hillside <PERSON> Strangler </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON> escaped from prison Tuesday night, along with another inmate, authorities said. <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, 31, convicted of attempted first-degree murder in 1981 in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, was serving a life sentence at the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Veltry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Also missing at the 9 p.m. head count was <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>, 28, due for release next Tuesday after serving time for <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> charges of possession of stolen property and forgery, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He said the state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> also had filed a detainer for Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> for a previous escape, but he had no details of that case. Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, who has been dubbed the `` Copycat Strangler,'' and Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>, considered medium-security prisoners, apparently escaped from the north side of the prison, but further details were sketchy, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> have been notified, he said.

 Striking police in the western state of <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> burned buses and a police station, and paramilitary troops fired tear gas at policemen's wives and children marching in support, news reports said today. The state police declared an indefinite strike Monday to protest the <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> government's move to disband unions and dismiss union leaders calling for higher wages. Police and family members torched two state-owned buses in <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION> early today, and a mob of police burned down a police station Tuesday in <LOCATION> Gandhinagar </LOCATION>, the state capital, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported.

The protesters were shouting slogans, the paper said. There were no reports of casualties. The state government Sunday ordered the arrest of police union leaders demanding higher wages and benefits. Officials said the leaders were inciting a police rebellion. The government also banned four of the strongest police unions. Army and paramilitary troops were ordered to move in and disarm the state's 59,000-member police force on Sunday. At least 55 police have been dismissed for insubordination.

 The dollar rose slightly and share prices soared in active trading Wednesday as traders awaited the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures for the second quarter. The dollar opened at 132.50 yen and ranged between 132.37 yen and 132.65 yen before closing at 132.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's close. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 120.23 points Tuesday, surged 434.81 points, or 1.59 percent, to close at 27,738.57. Heavy electrical, light electrical, construction and automobile issues led the surge, analysts said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report on second quarter GNP, the broadest measure of economic growth, is being watched partly for indications it could give in inflationary trends. Greater-than-expected GNP growth could signal higher inflation, analysts said. The report was scheduled for release later Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Stock prices also were supported by a burst of activity prompted by the first day of trading for the August account. Wednesday's transactions will be settled four trading days later on Monday The first day of trading for a new month's account usually attracts buyers. The dollar, reflecting its overnight strength overseas, opened at 132.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's close, and was trading at 132.43 yen by late morning. `` The dollar was supported by market expectations that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP data would show a solid performance of its economy,'' said one dealer.

 Operators of a preschool program say they were stunned to learn the woman they hired as an aide five years ago was wanted for allegedly hijacking a jetliner to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> in 1969. `` If we had any indication that this woman was a hostage-taker, we would n't be sitting here today,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, head of the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> program, said Tuesday. `` There's nothing in her five-year history that would indicate any abuse or violence toward children.'' But authorities said the quiet mother her neighbors knew as <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> was 39-year-old <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who was arrested Monday on a 19-year-old indictment for air piracy. Rifle-toting <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents surrounded the home of <LOCATION> Grinage </LOCATION> and her husband, lawyer <PERSON> Mylo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, then took her into custody on charges of hijacking a Miami-bound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight with 146 people aboard in 1969 and directing its pilot at gunpoint to fly to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and her then-husband, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, allegedly took a 2-year-old boy hostage on the flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, authorities said. The woman, who had her own an infant strapped to her back, ran screaming up the aisle of the plane, followed by <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> who was shouting `` Black power, <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'' to terrified passengers and crew members, according to news accounts of the hijacking. The passengers and hostage returned to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> unharmed, and <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> apparently spent some time in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with her husband, officials said. Authorities said they do not know how <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, but they lost track of her during the 1970s. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank robbery attempt in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Patrons of the Calumet Restaurant next door to the Eytinas' apartment in a working-class section of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> said they had little contact with the family in the three months they'd lived in the neighborhood <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roby </PERSON>, who lives in an apartment house next to the Eytinas', said they `` just seemed like ordinary people,'' but he only knew them well enough to say hello on the street. `` I was very surprised,'' <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> said. `` Not only that they were living next door but that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> kept the case open for so many years. ... It's kind of like the <ORGANIZATION> Mounties </ORGANIZATION>. They always get their man.'' An anonymous caller tipped authorities a year ago that <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> was living in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. Authorities said <PERSON> Grinaged </PERSON> used 14 aliases. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators spent the last year painstakingly putting together pieces of information about the case, including old photographs and handwriting samples. `` We were just as shocked as everybody when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was outside with guns pointed at everybody,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON>, director of the Masterson Day Care Center a few doors from the Eytinas' apartment A glum-looking <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> would n't talk to reporters as she was led away in handcuffs from brief court appearances Monday and Tuesday, but her husband labeled the charges `` absolute poppycock.'' He said he and his wife had lived and worked in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> for 10 years, although police had only traced her <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> residence to 1983. `` I think people should speak highly of me and my wife because we've worked diligently to be spoken highly of,'' <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said Tuesday, after a federal court hearing to establish his wife's identity was put off for one day The couple had six children, but one was killed last year in an auto accident, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alford </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> office.

 Associates of attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> say he's not a Democratic activist, despite Republican criticism of his appointment to investigate the ethical conduct of his fellow Democrat, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> On Tuesday, the 51-year-old <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> was named to investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said members of both parties were satisified <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> could do an impartial job But some Republicans were upset with the choice, noting that <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> had raised money for Democratic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s failed presidential bid and was elected as a <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to the Democratic National Convention `` The appointment of liberal Democrat activist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as outside counsel in the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case certainly calls into question the independence of the ethics committee inquiry,'' said a statement from a group called Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Some of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s associates, however, took issue with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> criticism. Although he was elected as a delegate to the Democratic convention last week, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> decided not to go. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> resigned his position as a delegate before the convention, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> did not indicate why <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> had resigned. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s national finance director, said she would not characterize <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as an `` activist.'' `` I assume he's been active locally, but I've been involved in Democratic politics at the statewide level for six years and this year was the first time I ever met Mr. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> said. A law partner of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s firm, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> may have contributed money to candidates in the past, but had never run for office himself. `` He may have political interests, but his main interests seem to be his firm and his family,'' said the partner, speaking on condition of anonymity. Last year, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> successfully defended <ORGANIZATION> Jewel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a lawsuit in which attorneys sought $ 100 million in punitive damages for hundreds of people sickened in the nation's largest outbreak of salmonella. The 1985 outbreak had been traced to milk from a Jewel dairy in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The copany ended up compensating those who fell ill for their actual losses but not paying extra punitive damages. The contract with <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s firm will be for no more than $ 300,000, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said, adding that he could not estimate how long the investigation would take. Charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> include using his office to lobby federal officials and others on matters in which he had a financial interest, and improprieties in the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high royalties. `` As I see our job, it's to conduct an independent, full review of all the facts that have been presented in the inquiry and report back to the committee,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> told reporters outside the closed committee room. `` The fact that I'm a Democrat does n't stand in my way of being fair and full.'' A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> graduated in 1958 from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>, and received his law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1961.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Proposes `Collegial' Government Of Four Cambodian Parties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> today proposed setting up a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government and army that represent equally the four warring parties in the 9-year-old civil war. The proposal by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> upstaged peace negotiations in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> between the Vietnamese-installed government and the three-party guerrilla coalition that has been trying to topple it. He told representatives of all four factions, who traveled to <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> to hear him, that the proposed four-party government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> capital, would be `` a collegial system perfectly equal.'' He suggested that `` we keep intact our four armies but they fraternally form the national army of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with a quadripartite general staff.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> also wants an international conference under the auspices of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> convened as soon as possible to guarantee the neutrality of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops and organize free elections. Vietnamese troops invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and overthrew the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, which killed at least a million Cambodians in its attempt to impose agrarian communism after gaining power in 1975. The four warring Cambodian factions and representatives from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have been holding informal talks in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> since Monday. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, 65, quit as leader of the anti-Vietnamese coalition this month and left leadership of his faction to his son, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. But he agreed to visit <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> as a guest of President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>. Leaders of the four factions made a pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> today to hear <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1941 to 1970. He presented his proposals in English in a speech to Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the Vietnam-installed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>; Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. There was no immediate comment from the other factions, and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said the proposal had no better than a 50-50 chance of being accepted. The plan was broad and lacked specific details. Representatives of the four factions met privately with him before returning to <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said the three-member coalition manages to stick together because they hate <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> slightly more than each other. `` It is certainly handy to make <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> assume alone the responsibility for our miseries and humiliations,'' he said. `` But it is not less true that some Khmer factions are equally heavily responsible for these miseries and humiliations.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has rejected the latest peace plan from the Vietnam-backed government. Many Cambodians remain deeply suspicious of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s motives despite <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s promise to withdraw all occupation troops by the first quarter of 1990. Many also fear a return to power by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest member of the coalition. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said a consensus was developing at <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> that the troop withdrawal should be linked with steps to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> do not regain power.

<HEAD>Missing Woman Believed Victim of Voodoo Obsession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The disappearance of a married woman has led police on a search through the subculture of voodoo practiced by her lover who may have killed her, then tried to ward off her spirit with bizarre talismans, authorities said. The body of <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> has never been found, but an occultist contacted by police theorizes the 52-year-old woman was buried in a grave beneath a crude cross, the victim of her jealous lover's suicidal obsession with the primitive religion. <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>, a telephone company administrator who disappeared June 2, was likely killed by her lover of 20 years, a 47-year-old roofing contractor who changed his name in 1979 from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to <PERSON> Che </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> was found dead in his bed of cyanide poisoning June 7 when investigators broke into his barricaded home in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> suburb expecting to find <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>'s body. Investigators found a crude altar in his closet along with items including three snapshots of <LOCATION> Rubia </LOCATION> covered with salt and three one-quart jars turned upside down with a strip of tape labeled `` Me'' on one, a second labeled `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>'' with `` Stop it!'' written underneath and a third reading `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> and I.'' These, other items and desperate letters mailed by <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> before his suicide blaming <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> and her `` witchcraft'' for his bad health and business failures sent investigators to a voodoo expert in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, whom investigators did not identify. The expert, a self-described `` good witch,'' said the items are those used in voodoo, an African-born religion based on a belief in sorcery. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> probably buried <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> in a way that would prevent her spirit from escaping the grave, which would likely be covered with salt and pins, the expert told police. `` Salt and pins were to keep her spirit confined, even in death, and that's why the expert was sure she was tied, too,'' said Detective <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> police department's missing persons unit. The jars, molasses and spices in the closet were supposed to seal in bad spirits and prevent them from attacking <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, the expert told police. `` He wanted a barrier between him and her in both worlds,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Other clues indicated <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> had been killed, police said. Her bloody prescription glasses were found in <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>'s pickup truck after he committed suicide. He had told friends that he would kill <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> if she tried to end their affair, and in her diary she described how he had beat her, once nearly to death. <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> attended a Catholic retreat shortly before her disappearance at which she decided to leave her lover and devote herself to her husband and family, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The evidence indicated <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> had a stormy relationship during which <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> had other lovers. `` They were very much in love,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` You should see their love letters. They both were very jealous of each other. They fought all the time because he wanted to be the boss. But she was a strong and feisty woman.''

<HEAD>Police Link Terrorists' Weapons To Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Terrorists who attacked a Greek cruise ship and killed nine people used two automatic weapons that had been sold to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, police said. One gun was found aboard the liner City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> after the July 11 attack, and the other was found in the wreckage of a car that blew up a few hours before the attack, killing its two occupants, said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source said Tuesday that the guns were Italian-made Berettas that had been sold to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which has been linked to international terrorism. Government officials, also speaking privately, said the weapons were Berettas but that they were initially sold to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Police have linked the car explosion to the cruise ship massacre and speculate that the vehicle contained explosives and weapons to be used in a hijack attempt. They theorize that the attack was a bungled attempt to force the release of Palestinian <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, sentenced July 13 to seven months for entering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on a forged passport. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is considering a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for his extradition on charges of planting a bomb aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in 1982. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> appeared in court Tuesday for an identity check that was immediately postponed. A new hearing was set for Aug. 2 after <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 39, said he was n't briefed on details of his case, a judicial spokesman said. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> says his real name is <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> and told reporters at the court that `` the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> police arrested the wrong man.'' The hearing before an appeal court prosecutor was a routine procedure in cases where mistaken identity is claimed, said the judicial spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Palestinian was arrested May 29 at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by police acting on a tip from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. He was carrying a forged Syrian passport in the name of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>. But a fingerprint check showed him to be <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, who was jailed in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> from 1973-76 on narcotics smuggling charges, police said. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> also is accused of bombing a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in April 1986. Four people, including a baby girl, died when the explosion blasted them out of the plane.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker offered to try to have American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> freed in exchange for Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said, `` No deals.'' `` If -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were sincere he ... would release the Iranian assets,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today quoted speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying. `` I have said that once he does so then we will use our leverage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and help solve the issue of hostages,'' he was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also is commander-in-chief of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces, spoke in a battlefront interview Tuesday. Nine Americans are believed held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. `` So long as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> keeps its hostile attitude toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, there will be no sign of any changes and there will be no negotiations,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Tuesday in a television interview monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. He said that one indication of good will would be releasing Iranian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters: `` No deals. The clearest signal they could send is to release the hostages. `` We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far as we are concerned you just ca n't link the two,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, considered the second most powerful figure in the Iranian government after the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, did not refer to any specific Iranian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he said the Iranian government paid the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for goods not delivered before the Islamic revolution toppled the government of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> in 1979. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> probably was referring to military equipment, but they had no dollar figure. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and put a hold on its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets after Iranians stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and took 52 Americans hostage. They were released in January 1981 after 444 days in captivity. As part of the release agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> was set up in the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, and charged with arbitrating billions of dollars of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian financial claims arising from the Iranian revolution. By 1987, the tribunal had awarded about $ 1 billion to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> claimants and about $ 60 million to Iranians, plus an undetermined amount of interest to claimants on both sides. In May, three French hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems were released after the French government reportedly agreed to repay a $ 1 billion loan to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Nine Americans are among the 18 foreigners missing and believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Shiite Moslem extremists. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was abducted in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said: `` The problem of hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a question relating to the Lebanese. It is not our question -LRB- problem -RRB-. `` But on the basis of humanitarian aspects, we will do our best, as we have done until now. And we do hope that all innocent people as hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or any place in the world could be released very soon.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. He met twice Tuesday with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. In an interview on the state-owned French television network Antenne-2 on Tuesday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said recent efforts toward peace `` create a favorable atmosphere'' for the hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said he planned `` to ask <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to offer its good offices to prompt the freeing of the hostages. It is not the first time I have made an appeal for them to help.'' But he said, `` No one can affirm that it is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who is responsible'' for the fate of the 18 men still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, contacted at her home in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said: `` I think everything that's coming out of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is encouraging.'' `` There seems to be a reaching out for communication. If <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s captivity and the captivity of the other Americans is to mean anything it would hopefully be a movement toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Twenty Bodies Found On Raised Fishing Boat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A salvage team today raised the wreckage of the fishing boat that collided with a navy submarine and found the bodies of all but one of the missing passengers and crew, coast guard officials said. Discovery of the 20 bodies in the ship's lounge and cabins raised to 29 the confirmed death toll from Saturday's collision, the officials said. Forty-eight people, most members of a company fishing club, had been on the chartered boat. Workers used a 230-foot crane to raise the hull to the surface in pre-dawn darkness today near the mouth of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. A hole was visible in its bow just below the waterline. Coast guard ships brought victims' relatives to within a few yards of where the boat, the No. 1 <PERSON> Fujimaru </PERSON>, was raised from a depth of about 160 feet. Survivors, relatives of victims and newspapers charged that crew members aboard the submarine stood by watching on the submarine's deck while victims drowned The submarine sustained little damage and no injuries were reported among the 75 men on board. One survivor from the fishing boat told reporters the sub's crewmen stared back as she waved and yelled, `` Why wo n't you help? Of the 19 people rescued from the 154-ton fishing boat, which sank in less than two minutes, 16 were picked up by other passing vessels and only three by the submarine. One man died later in a hospital. News reports said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> offered his resignation over the accident but will stay on until an investigation is complete. Defense officials said they could not comment on the reports. The status of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military, officially called the Self-Defense Forces, is still a sensitive issue after the military excesses of World War II. The nation's constitution officially bars the maintenance of all `` war potential,'' and sharp public criticism usually follows any accident for which the Self-Defense Forces is responsible. News reports suggested the captain of the submarine, the 2,200-ton Nadashio, may have erred just before the collision. The accident occurred as the submarine, traveling on the surface, was cutting across a busy shipping lane to enter <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> naval base, shared by the Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> navies. Japanese maritime rules say the vessel approaching from the left must take evasive action when on a collision course with another ship, while the second ship must maintain its direction. But <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> television reports quoted the fishing boat's surviving crew as saying the <PERSON> Nadashio </PERSON>, on the left, honked at the fishing boat to warn it out of its path Just before the crash, both ships turned in the same direction, and collided almost head-on. `` As captain of the ship, I did my best until the last minute to avoid a collision according to maritime collision prevention laws,'' <PERSON> Manji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, the 30-year-old captain of the fishing boat, told a televised news conference late Tuesday. Admiral <PERSON> Shuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON>, navy chief of staff, told reporters today he believes the submarine's crew took proper measures to avoid the accident. But he said `` appropriate actions would be taken'' against any officials found responsible for the accident in the final judgment by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It was the worst collision between Japanese navy and civilian vessels since World War II, defense officials said.

<TEXT>
 A woman who won the nation's admiration for her bravery as rescuers worked to pull her from under a collapsed 35-ton crane has settled a lawsuit for nearly $ 10 million for the accident that crushed her legs. Under terms disclosed Tuesday, 52-year-old <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> will receive $ 1 million immediately, then $ 27,625 a month for a year, then the same monthly payment for the rest of her life with a compounded 3 percent increase each year. Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. Her attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Conason </PERSON>, would not disclose her whereabouts. `` She's relieved it's over and wishes it never happened,'' he said. `` She wants to be a productive, private person.'' A former police officer who pleaded with her to hang on for her life the day of the accident said the money can not make up for the tragedy. `` You ca n't put a price on the pain and agony she went through and must go through. She's had a tragic life but has the spirit to bounce back,'' said retired Detective <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragonese </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> was injured while returning from a dental appointment shortly around noon on May 30, 1985. The crane, operated by an unlicensed worker, fell on her legs as she passed the site where a 42-story apartment building was being built. `` I heard all the bones cracking,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> testified at the trial of <PERSON> Lino </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON>, the site foreman, and his employer, <ORGANIZATION> Crimmins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I screamed for help. ` Help me! Help me! Get me out!''' Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> testified that she lay beneath the crane for six hours, in agony and with her legs crushed, and that at one point, she asked for a priest because she thought she was dying. She underwent at least seven operations on her legs. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called her during her recovery and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> threw a party for her when she left the hospital. In 1986, she was walking on crutches at the criminal trial. Today, she can walk without crutches. The settlement of the lawsuit against <PERSON> Crimmins </PERSON>, the city and others, was reached after a session Monday in the courtroom of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trial judge, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxe </PERSON>. The money is to be paid to Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON>, a widow, through an annuity the defendants are setting up with an insurance company. If she dies, her estate will receive the money for at least 20 years. The total would be $ 9,906,738, said <PERSON> Conason </PERSON>. The lawsuit was filed shortly after the criminal case ended in spring 1986. <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON>, 54, was fined $ 5,000, put on five years' probation and ordered to perform community service for allowing an unqualified person, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricciardi </PERSON>, to operate the crane. Crimmins Construction was fined $ 10,000. <PERSON> Ricciardi </PERSON>, 31, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, was sentenced to a few months in jail and placed on probation.

<TEXT>
 South Korean legislators today accepted a North Korean plan for talks on a non-aggression pact and on clearing the way for the north to take part in the 1988 Olympics, officials said. South Korean <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> officials said representatives of the top four political parties and Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON> agreed to accept the North Korean offer and planned initial contacts in the second week of August. `` The south is ready to take up the Olympic issue and does not want to limit the agenda,'' one aide said on condition of anonymity. Party leaders must approve the plan, but officials said this would be automatic and that a positive response would be sent to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Monday. South Korean officials said they want preliminary talks at the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to work out terms for the talks. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last week asked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for talks between their legislatures on drawing up a pact to end the long rivalry between the two nations. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called for the first round to be held in its capital, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. The north said in a second letter Tuesday that it also was ready to discuss entering the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September on condition that its demand to co-host the Olympics be discussed. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have refused to let the north co-host the Olympics because the Games are awarded to a single city. The north has said it will boycott the Games if it can not co-host. South Korean Olympic officials, also speaking privately, said the refusal to allow a co-host had not changed. They said the north appeared to be setting co-hosting as a condition so that any new talks probably would be inconclusive. Three previous rounds of talks between the south and north on easing tension and establishing relations ended in failure. The north broke off the most recent talks in 1986. A North Korean decision to take part in the Olympics without co-hosting would be a drastic turnabout. The north sees the south's hosting of the Olympics as a major political defeat in the struggle between the two nations for supremacy The two governments refuse to recognize each other and claim to be the sole legitimate government on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The peninsula was divided in 1945 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces at the end of World War II and remained divided after the 1950-53 Korean War. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other nations fear the north may resort to terrorism to disrupt the Olympics if it can not co-host the Games. The north, which has attacked the south repeatedly, was blamed for the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean airliner near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> with all 115 people aboard killed. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denied any involvement in the attack. North Korean hopes for a boycott of the Olympics by communist nations collapsed when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> agreed to send teams to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. A record 161 nations are taking part in the Games. Only <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have backed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to co-host the Olympics.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it launched an attack on Iraqi forces in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today, and commander-in-chief <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> predicted victory. `` The able combatants of Islam, in order to chase and destroy the aggressive Iraqi forces on a greater scale, early this morning attacked the core of the enemy forces in the operational axis north of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>,'' said an announcer who broke into regular programs on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio.

Eighteen men, including nine Americans, are believed held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. Iraqi-backed Iranian guerrillas opposed to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said Tuesday they pushed deep into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> acknowledged its forces were fighting `` counter-revolutionary mercenaries.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> this week announced its forces were withdrawing from the area just north of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>, an Iranian port city, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued to claim the Iraqis were invading the area. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said today that at least 300 Iraqis were killed or wounded in the latest fighting in the area and dozens of tanks or armored personnel carriers were destroyed. `` A complete brigade of the Iraqi army has been encircled by the forces of Islam,'' said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` In the course of the victorious battle this morning ... numerous units of the enemy in this region were caught by surprise and they are in a state of evident confusion'' in a strip of land close to the border, the radio said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision last week to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire call was `` a major political and cultural victory, which fortunately will be followed by a military victory.'' `` We are witnessing the complete defeat of the Iraqi forces on the southern front as well as the western fronts,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s comments were made Tuesday in a battlefront headquarters interview, and portions were carried on Iranian television and radio Tuesday night. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> provided additional quotations from the interview today. `` Thus far we were defending ourselves while branded as the warmonger party and the one which does not want peace,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution shortly after it was passed, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> waited a year. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is also speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and one of the most powerful men in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as saying recent incursions into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> proved that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not want peace. `` The Iraqi regime by nature is aggressive and will launch aggression any time it finds an appropriate place and feels powerful,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> renewed his earlier calls for able-bodied Iranians to rush to the war front to confront the Iraqi `` invasion.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes bombed residental areas in the western city of <LOCATION> Ilam </LOCATION>, but it said no reports were available on casualties or damage. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air defenses shot down an Iranian F-5 warplane over the southern front. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not comment on the claim. Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they marched deep into western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, taking the towns of <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION> and Eslamabad. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio acknowledged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` made use of counter-revolutionary mercenaries to infiltrate the population and to martyr the heroic men and women there.'' The rebels said they were advancing on the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>. They said they overran <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, 43 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 18 miles farther; destroyed the 27th Revolutionary Guards corps division and captured its garrison 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s border. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it recaptured <PERSON> Eslamabad </PERSON> and killed 1,100 rebels. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is the military wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> organization, an anti-Khomeini force that moved to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after its leaders were expelled from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986. Its troop strength is believed to range up to 15,000 men and women.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wildfires or not, <PERSON> Roehr </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> said he could n't change his plans to see Yellowstone National Park. The West German and his family were among the thousands of tourists who continued flocking to the world-famous park this week despite fires burning thousands of acres of forest and meadow. Even as smoke from the 6,000-acre North Fork fire billowed behind the Guenters while they waited for Old Faithful to erupt, they expressed enthusiasm about the 2.2 million-acre park and the elk and bison they have seen. The fires appeared to have little effect on the number of people entering the park. Last weekend, 41,346 cars entered the park, comparable to 42,327 cars the previous weekend. Like many tourists, the Guenters changed their plans slightly when they found the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Entrance </LOCATION> to the park closed Sunday because of fires burning in the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> area. They drove their rental car back to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, then into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and through the park's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Entrance </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, Mont. The closing of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Entrance </LOCATION> has been a boon to the tourism business in eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, resort manager at <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, has been `` turning people away at the door. It's unfortunate that the fire is burning, but we've been full up. `` We've been renting rooms we usually would not rent, but people say, ` We'll take anything,''' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. All accommodations in the park, campsites and hotel rooms, are full, and space is scarce in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iobst </PERSON>, a park spokesman. The fires have closed campgrounds in the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> areas. Motels and campgrounds in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> have been having a record year, and the closure of <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in the park when fire threatened it filled any vacancies there might have been. `` We've been solid booked for a week,'' said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillory </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said the fires seemed to add `` a little confusion'' to the traffic, but found the blazes `` kind of dramatic, really.'' He said he would not change his plans to spend the last three days of his 30-day vacation in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> accused his right-wing adversaries of fanning the flames of the seven-month Palestinian uprising by sabotaging a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. Shouting broke out Tuesday in a closed-door meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> over differences on the peace proposals of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` If it were n't for the sabotage of the peace process, of the Shultz initiative, by half the government, then maybe we would n't be in the middle of the intefadeh,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said, using the Arabic word for `` uprising. But <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc legislator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>, a close associate of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, signaled flexibility about negotiations on the future of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted him as saying in a speech that even those who supported <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' proposals for territorial compromise should vote for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> in the November election because it would drive a harder bargain. `` We must send to the negotiations those who will get the best results,'' said <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>. `` Who do those who are concerned for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security prefer to send to negotiations _ those who want to get rid of the territories or those who will insist on every square inch and get the best compromise?'' <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> also was quoted as suggesting it may have been a mistake to hold on to the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which was captured from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. Seven opposition parties filed motions of no confidence today in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s coalition government, some citing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s failure to put down the Palestinian rebellion. The motions were defeated. The two-hour foreign policy meeting degenerated into a shouting match between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Eliahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Elissar </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. According to other lawmakers, <PERSON> Ben-Elissar </PERSON> called <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> a `` Bolshevik,'' referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s socialist-leaning ideology. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> retaliated by shouting at <PERSON> Ben-Elissar </PERSON>: `` You're always slandering! You act like a fascist!'' Visiting Conservative rabbis stepped into the fray by urging Israelis not to vote for religious parties, which have held the balance of power between the two major blocs in recent years. `` The time has come for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to adopt the separation of synagogue and state as practiced in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Kassel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, president of the 1,200-member <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. More then 230 Palestinians have been killed since the anti-occupation uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been killed. Labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in return for peace, while <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes any concessions to the Arabs. The two parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984 coalition agreement was forged to break an election stalemate. Pollsters predict a tight race between Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, with the latter holding a slight edge largely due to support for Israeli hawkishness in response to the Palestinian uprising.

<HEAD>Scientists Test Whether Shroud Dates From Time Of Crucifixion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scientists today tested a fragment from the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> to determine if it dates from the period of the crucifixion of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. The tests, using carbon-14 dating, were directed by Professor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>'s research laboratory for archaeology and the history of art. The 15-foot length of linen, bearing the image of a bearded, crucified man, is venerated by believers who accept that it covered <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' body in his tomb. Skeptics consider it a brilliant forgery from medieval times. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> of the British Museum said he hoped to get a date with a margin of error of 200 years. `` If 12th, 13th or 14th century, the result is perfectly clear cut,'' <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> said. `` If we get a date of 100 to 300 A.D. or 200 to 400 A.D., one would start being a bit edgy. Whatever result we come up with, one still has the question of how the image got there,'' he said. Similar carbon tests have been done at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The American and Swiss findings are being kept secret until the results of all three tests can be announced together, expected in September from Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>. The Oxford scientists were sent three thumbnail-size fragments of cloth and were not told which of the three was cut from the shroud, which is kept in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> Cathedral. Cosmic rays entering the earth's atmosphere create radioactive carbon-14 atoms that are absorbed by all vegetation and thus become part of any material with an organic base, like linen and cotton. The atoms decay at a known rate, making it possible to estimate how long ago a material absorbed them.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> says Irish-Americans who `` beat up the British'' for their role in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> are taking the easy way out. The mayor, back at City Hall Tuesday, defended remarks he made in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> earlier in the day at the end of his five-day pilgrimage for peace in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> with Cadinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had praised the `` good attitude'' of the British, saying, `` I do not believe that they deserve the castigation that any of us, myself included, have heaped upon them. `` I do not believe that the British are occupying forces,'' he told reporters. `` My impression in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is that the British are trying to play a constructive role. `` I think they're -LRB- in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> -RRB- more from the point of view of safeguarding the peace by preventing what, if these people were Jewish, would be called a pogrom.'' The comments brought an immediate negative reaction from prominent local Irish-Americans, including <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> comptroller who has visited <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> 11 times and was the 1985 St. Patrick's Day Parade grand marshal. He called the mayor's remarks `` senseless and ridiculous'' and said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was `` demonstrating an appalling ignorance and disregard for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he changed his mind about the British after learning more about the recent accords between the governments of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for settling problems between the Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> factions in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` The easiest thing to do is to beat up the British,'' he said. `` They are responsible for the historical reasons for the division of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' he conceded. `` But, if you put that aside and talk about what they are doing today ... I came to the conclusion that the British today are playing a positive role.''

 Leaders of two of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s most violent gangs met with clergy in a hotel surrounded by police, seeking to end bloody feuding that has contributed to more than 165 killings this year. `` The talks are going well,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> said after the first closed-door meeting Tuesday between four leaders each of the Crips and Bloods, gangs depicted in the sensational crime film `` Colors.'' Gang violence also was the target of a protest Tuesday night in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where hundreds of people conducted a candlelight march. `` We wo n't live in fear,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who organized the rally. Crips and Bloods leaders met with the ministers at a motel in suburban <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> 15 miles south of here for about 90 minutes, then agreed to meet again today and Thursday. As they met, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies from the Operation Safe Streets gang detail cruised nearby streets and watched from rooftops with binoculars. A news blackout on details of the meeting will continue until a news conference scheduled for Thursday, said <PERSON> Mims </PERSON>, one of the ministers in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Watts neighborhood who organized the talks. The ministers arranged the negotiations in hopes the gang leaders would find enough common ground to at least slow the pace of killing. More than 165 people in the county have died in violence attributed to street gangs this year. Last year, 387 people, many innocent bystanders, fell victim to gang violence. Tuesday's rare face-to-face encounter among young people who usually confront each other at gunpoint was triggered by concern the killings had gotten out of control. `` They're tired of the violence and they're tired of being used'' by drug dealers and other underworld figures, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Last weekend, four people died and 16 were wounded in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area gang attacks. Members of the Bloods and the Crips are mostly black, inner-city youths and young adults. Police blame the two gangs for much of the gang-related violence plaguing the nation's second largest city. Police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said before the meeting that he hoped the talks would have a `` settling influence'' on gang members who control an arsenal of military assault weapons such as Uzi submachine guns. Some civic leaders, however, expressed skepticism that a handful of people could work out an agreement that would be the key to peace for the nearly 300 black gangs citywide. `` This is a farce,'' said <PERSON> Chilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which works with gang members. Gang members should not expect `` to be treated like ambassadors from warring nations, complete with television interviews and surrounded by public officials,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said through a spokesman. The talks came as collective rage and frustration over the violence mounted. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where Hispanic gangs dominate, hundreds of parishoners from the <ORGANIZATION> Dolores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> marched, holding candles and singing in Spanish, `` We will walk these streets in peace.'' The crowd, many of them children, held banners saying, `` Education and Jobs, Not Drugs.'' The march was intended to serve notice not only to unwelcome gang members but to outsiders seeking drugs, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. `` The BMWs come Friday -LRB- during -RRB- rush hour. Men with white coats with stethoscopes around their necks buy cocaine that is the cheapest in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' he complained. `` We've had a solid week of shootings,'' he said, adding some residents believe they are safer sleeping in their kitchens than in their bedrooms. Often, gang members launch their attacks from passing automobiles. Many times the victims are children and bystanders caught in a crossfire. In recent months, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs have been trying to develop a lucrative drug trade in cities as far away as <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>.; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, according to police in those cities. Police here estimate gang membership in the county at 100,000. Law enforcement leaders were cautious in predicting the results of the Carson talks. `` The task that these so-called gang leaders have set before them will be difficult, but I do n't know that it's impossible,'' said Assistant Sheriff <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>.

 Soviets can donate money to a special bank account to build a memorial to the victims of late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said account number 700454 was opened at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> at the request of the weekly Literary Gazette newspaper. The fund drive aims `` to build a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the victims of Stalinist repressions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief dispatch. The newspaper has published many articles over the past year detailing repressions under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, the Soviet leader from 1924 until his death in 1953. Western historians have estimated that as many as 20 million Soviets died as a result of his political purges, mass deportations and forced collectivization of agriculture. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> reported that citizens writing in support of a memorial to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims had suggested `` without exception'' that the fund-raising project be a public rather than a governmental effort. `` A public committee, elected by a democratic method, will be set up to manage the fund and to oversee the construction of the memorial,'' the agency said. It gave no details of the account or the memorial likely to be built from donations. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions have been exposed and criticized in many articles in the Soviet media that have been published since <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power three years ago and began his campaign for `` glasnost,'' or more openness about Soviet history and social problems. Some of the late dictator's political victims, like revolutionary <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, have been officially rehabilitated and reinstated into the party as a result of the historical review.

 Love Canal, a symbol of environmental disaster, will eventually be restored as a residential area, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s top environmental officer says. `` We have a vision that we can restore Love Canal to a vibrant landscape again,'' state Environmental Conservation Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> said Tuesday. More than 800 families left the 10-block area in 1978 when toxic wastes from a former chemical dump were discovered seeping into their homes. Although many homes closest to the dump were torn down, some 175 families are awaiting the results of a state study of whether their homes are habitable. Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> is expected to decide the issue this fall. However, in one of the first indications from state officials on the contents of the study, <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> said the neighborhood would not be left vacant. `` Our policy of remediation means restoring it to use,'' <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> said. `` How could we sustain the policy if we're going to keep it off limits?'' State and federal agencies have spent some $ 200 million containing and monitoring the contamination, he said. The site has been fenced off, a leachate collection and treatment facility built and the landfill capped with a synthetic liner and clay. `` We have the problem abated,'' he said. <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> did not discuss how the neighborhood could be restored. He said that would depend on <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>'s ruling. But Mayor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> on a tour of the site, pointed to boarded homes and said, `` I see these places being lived in.'' <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON> said many homes could be reopened because there was no evidence of contamination. State and federal governments should provide money to renovate the homes, he said. The landfill itself would probably remain off limits forever, he said. Formers residents and some people who have remained in their homes near the site were skeptical of the idea. `` I not sure they'll ever know what's safe and what is n't,'' said former resident <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremist group has claimed responsibility for killing a member of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement Tuesday to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> media, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it shot <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 33, on Monday as he answered a knock at his door by three men dressed as policemen. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, accused police of collusion with the killers. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said a patrol of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, passed outside <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s home shortly before he was killed. `` This prompts us to believe there was collusion, not of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> as a whole but between individual members of the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> and loyalist paramilitaries,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to oust <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the island, also said in a statement Tuesday night that it paid its `` final tribute'' to <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> by firing a volley of shots on a street in the <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned its tradition of firing a gun volley over coffins of its members, a practice which had led to confrontations with security forces. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s killing was believed to be in retaliation for an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing Saturday near the Irish border that killed a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> couple and their 6-year-old son. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> apologized for the attack, saying the bomb had been targeted at security forces.

<TEXT>
 Consumer groups have argued that a proposed settlement for owners of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 sedans who contend the cars are prone to unintended acceleration was not properly reviewed and should be thrown out. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> and the plaintiffs countered Tuesday that they had mailed out 345,000 notices of the settlement and only 1,500 people said they would not agree to it. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowsky </PERSON> set a new hearing on the proposed settlement for Aug. 11. In June, attorneys announced the proposed settlement, under which <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> would offer rebates of $ 300 to $ 2,000 to 390,000 current or former owners who buy another <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged no liability. The settlement would affect owners of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 sedans built between 1978 and 1986. The Center for Auto Safety contends that at least 1,650 accidents, causing 402 injuries and five deaths, have been linked to acceleration surges when the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 was shifted from park into gear. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> contends there was nothing wrong with the cars.

 Federal prosecutors for the first time have brought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insider trading. The lawyer, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was one of 12 people indicted Tuesday for alleged financial crimes. He is accused of making $ 680,000 in illegal profits using information he obtained while a partner of the law firm <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` This is the first time in history we've used the racketeering statute in an insider trading case,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. The racketeering statute provides greater penalties and gives the government more power to seize illicit gains than other laws prohibiting insider trading, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, racketeering and filing a false income tax return. If convicted on all counts, he could receive up to 363 years in prison and $ 13.5 million in fines and be forced to make restitution of any illegal profits. `` In the future, we expect to use the racketeering laws as a powerful weapon in these cases,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. Nine times in 1984 through 1986, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> learned of large pending stock acquisitions by clients, then invested heavily in the company whose stock was being bought, the government said. The deals involved stock in <ORGANIZATION> Portec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, prosecutors said. Directory assistance for <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> had no listing for <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. His former law firm said it had no knowledge of his whereabouts. Eight of the 12 people indicted Tuesday are accused in a separate $ 1.2 million scheme of churning accounts, in which brokers trade on customers' accounts merely to generate commissions. `` None of the 120 customers, most of whom were solicited by telephone, ever made a profit,'' said <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. The government said the alleged scheme was carried out by officers and employees of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with branches in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Those indicted include <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Josten </PERSON>, an owner and president of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted Three independent traders also were indicted in an investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. They are accused of participating in fraudulent trading involving <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, a former broker with <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> pleaded guilty to fraud in February and was sentenced to three years in prison The government said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> took successful trades he executed for his company and make it appear they had been made for one of the three traders. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said more than $ 700,000 was illegally diverted to the defendants, while <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> got a 35 percent cut.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former army general who ruthlessly suppressed dissidents over the past quarter century, today was named president of this troubled Southeast Asian nation. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who replaces 70-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yu </LOCATION>, on Tuesday assumed the country's most powerful position _ chairman of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. An emergency session of Parliament today also elected the former deputy prime minister and planning minister, <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, as prime minister. Vice President <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> remained in his post. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also promoted Defense Minister <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> to the No. 3 government position as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, which the 64-year-old <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> had vacated. It also endorsed a package of economic reforms proposed at a recent party congress. The former party chairman, Ne Win, retired after leading <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for 26 years. The presidency is the No. 1 government post. The elevation of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and other leadership changes appeared to dash any hopes that Ne Win's retirement would lead to reform of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s one-party, military-backed regime. But <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> and Tun Tin both are regarded as relatively liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in the country. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> also moved up to a top party post. Only one civilian was included in the new lineup, Attorney General Dr. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. The rest are retired or active duty military officers. Western diplomats contacted in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, without exception expressed dismay over <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s selection and several predicted a continuation of student demonstrations. Shortly after the announcement of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s selection as chairman, state radio said Prime Minister <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Myint </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had been dismissed from their posts by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> after being found reponsible in connection with bloody riots in March. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a close associate of Ne Win, commanded forces that brutally put down the March student riots, according to reliable Western diplomatic and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> sources. He has since been the target of criticism by students and other anti-government elements. More than 100 people were believed killed in a brief flare-up in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on March 18. Several other officials have been fired or reprimanded, but <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> escaped officially unscathed by the incident. The government has admitted that 43 people died, 41 of them suffocating in a packed police van while being transported to prison. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who had ranked No. 4 in the party hierarchy, also commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifles </ORGANIZATION>, which opened fire on some 2,000 anti-government demonstrations at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> July 7, 1962. Unofficial casualties were put at more than 100 and the following day authorities blew up the university's student union building. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who had served as the party's joint general secretary since 1985, was also involved in putting down demonstrations in 1974. Students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, angry at a shoddy government funeral for former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> U </PERSON> <PERSON> Thant </PERSON>, snatched his coffin and brought it to the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus, which was later stormed by rifle-firing troops. Ne Win asked to step down on Saturday. The congress accepted his resignation and that of party Vice Chairman <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> on Monday. In his resignation speech Ne Win raised hopes that major changes were in store for <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. In an unprecedented move, he called for a referendum to decide whether the country wished to perpetuate one-party rule or opt for a multi-party system. The congress turned down the referendum proposal and criticized recent unrest. Although Ne Win assumed indirect responsibility for the troubles in March and another outburst of anti-government violence in June, he warned that when army is called out it `` shoots to hit: it does not fire in the air to scare.'' Ne Win's resignation and the ensuing leadership changes follows three periods of student-led rioting since last October in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other Burmese cities. There is also mounting discontent over deteriorating economic conditions. The congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms but there has been an initial skepticism among diplomats about how far these will go and whether the current leaders can implement them even if they try. `` This does n't look like a strong enough team to carry out economic reforms,'' one Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said after <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s election to the party chairmanship. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s economy suffered greatly under Ne Win's isolationist policies. Inflation is soaring and the country has a foreign debt of $ 4 billion. Burmese consumers rely almost solely on black market goods smuggled in from neighboring countries. The government's tight control over agriculture and virtually all economic sectors has turned resource-rich <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into one of the world's 10 poorest countries that last year suffered food shortages.

<HEAD>Rain Forces Early Closure Of Festival Of London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s rainy summer has forced organizers to close the elaborate Festival of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after only four days. It was scheduled to run 16 days. Director and spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said Tuesday that heavy rain kept crowds away from the festival at <ORGANIZATION> Alexandra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, an exhibition and concert center in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said the rain left <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palace </PERSON> park muddy and made it difficult to stage many events. The night before the festival opened, wind almost wrecked a specially built arena. Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> opened the $ 3 million festival Saturday. It was hailed as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s most ambitious event of this sort since the Festival of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1951, which was held to demonstrate British economic and technical progress. `` The Festival of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> company has gone into voluntary liquidation,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` The decision was made at a directors' meeting this evening because attendance figures were so disappointing and because of the weather. He said it was too soon to assess the extent of losses but that they would be substantial. He said most people who had formal contracts with the company had been paid, including many performers, and the company would do its best for the others. The festival was financed privately by a consortium of about 15 shareholders involved in the entertainment or allied industries. Its 200 planned events included a marathon race, reconstruction of an Elizabethan village and Victorian streets and performances by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> State Circus. All festival events scheduled after Tuesday were called off, except for the circus, which will continue in its own tent in <LOCATION> Alexandra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> park. `` It is a tragedy for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. This was the first year, and we wanted to create a unique event for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> which could have been held annually,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces drove Iraqi troops out of southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today and fought <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for control of a town in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claimed 1,200 Iraqis were killed or wounded. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Iraqi forces shot down an Iranian F-5 warplane over the southern front. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not comment on the claim, but said its military shot down two <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes. The fighting occurred as officials from both countries were to meet separately in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to discuss a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, meanwhile, said it has captured 12,207 Iranians in six days of fighting. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has sought to improve its bargaining position in the talks by capturing an equal number of prisoners as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims to be holding. If today's claim by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is confirmed, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> now holds 25,000 Iranian prisoners of war compared to 50,000 Iraqi POWs held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> estimates. The Iranian commander-in-chief, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, offered Tuesday to try to have American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> freed in exchange for Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said, `` No deals.'' Eighteen men, including nine Americans, are believed held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces attacked <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops occupying part of southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today, drove them across the border and killed or wounded 1,200 Iraqis. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also said Iraqi troops again entered <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and a battle of `` utmost intensity'' was under way for control of the area. Earlier, Iraqi-backed Iranian guerrillas opposed to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said they pushed deep into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> acknowledged its forces were fighting `` counterrevolutionary mercenaries.'' A <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio announcer broke into regular programs to say: `` The able combatants of Islam, in order to chase and destroy the aggressive Iraqi forces on a greater scale, early this morning attacked the core of the enemy forces in the operational axis north of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>.'' The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, gave the casualty figure of 1,200 and said a brigade of the Iraqi 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> was encircled and `` destroyed'' in the fighting for control of an area just inside the Iranian border. The report said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops were `` driven back to the other side of the international border'' and 12 square miles of Iranian territory was `` liberated.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air force heavily bombed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troop concentrations during the fighting, the radio said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> earlier this week announced its forces were withdrawing from the area just north of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>, an Iranian port city, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued to claim the Iraqis were invading the area. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision last week to accept a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire call was `` a major political and cultural victory, which fortunately will be followed by a military victory.'' `` We are witnessing the complete defeat of the Iraqi forces on the southern front as well as the western fronts, and these have prepared very favorable conditions for the armed forces of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to show their power and capabilities,'' he said. His comments were made Tuesday in a battlefront headquarters interview, and portions were carried that night on Iranian television and radio. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> provided additional quotations today. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> renewed his earlier calls for able-bodied Iranians to rush to the war front to confront the Iraqi `` invasion.'' On Tuesday, the Iraqi-backed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed it marched deep into western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, taking the towns of <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION> and Eslamabad. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio acknowledged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` made use of counter-revolutionary mercenaries to infiltrate the population and to martyr the heroic men and women there.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said its guerrillas overran <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, 45 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 20 miles farther, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it recaptured <PERSON> Eslamabad </PERSON>, killing 1,100 rebels. Today, however, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said `` Iraqi troops'' entered Eslamabad in the morning. `` The battle in the region is continuing with utmost intensity, and the initiative lies with the combatants of Islam,'' said the radio. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is the military wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> organization, an anti-Khomeini force that moved to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after its leaders were expelled from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986.

 Masked gunmen broke into a home during a power blackout and forced the owner to hand over gold and currency worth about $ 360,000, a newspaper reported today. The newspaper said it was the most money and gold ever taken in the robbery of a private citizen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The robbery occurred Sunday night during a thunderstorm in <LOCATION> Bogucin </LOCATION>, near the western city of <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION>, according to an account in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Zycie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warszawy </ORGANIZATION>. The 71-year-old victim, described as a `` well-established market gardener'' who owns greenhouses, was awakened shortly before midnight Sunday by at least three masked robbers, who beat him and fired at least one shot, the report said. They then forced the man to open his strongbox and turn over gold, Western and Polish currency. The victim, who was not identified, has offered a reward of $ 11,000 for any information leading to the robbers, according to the account. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s greenhouse operators, who grow flowers, fruits and vegetables, are among the country's most affluent businessmen.

 Riot police today arrested about 30 students yelling `` Yankee go home!'' and demonstrating in front of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to demand expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. Hundreds of riot police in green fatigues and black visored helmets detained the students as they marched toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 8th Army headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The students, who tried to stage a peaceful sit-down protest, were forced into police buses. The dissidents also demonstrated to mark the 35th anniversary today of the end of the Korean War, begun in 1950 by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s invasion of the south. About 1,000 students and dissidents later marched toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> after a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of riot police followed the march through the city and blocked the students' way less than a mile from the embassy. There were no clashes and police persuaded the protesters to move into a nearby park. Forces from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other nations intervened on the side of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the war and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fought alongside the north. The war ended July, 27, 1953 in stalemate with the two sides signing an armistice. The students called for removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops still based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense treaty, and they carried banners denouncing the American military presence. `` Down with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which forced partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' protesters shouted. Radical students claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is responsible for the continued division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and rules the south as a virtual colony. Radicals have called for immediate reunification with the communist north. Most South Koreans fear the north remains determined to conquer the south and are vehemently opposed to the totalitarian regime in the north. The radicals have virtually no public support. The peninsula was divided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.

 A fire that appeared to have been set swept through a house early today, killing five people, including three children, authorities said. `` I ca n't say it's an arson,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of the police bomb and arson squad. `` But at this point we're aimed that way because with the mulitiple points of -LRB- the fire's -RRB- origin it's suspicious.'' A 28-year-old woman, her 3-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter were found in the front bedroom of the one-story brick bungalow on the city's southwest side, investigators said. The children's bodies were found in a bed, and the woman's body was on the floor, authorities said. An 18-year-old woman and her 5-year-old son were found in a rear bedroom, authorities said. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the victims suffered burns and apparently were overcome by smoke. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the fire was contained within the house, which sustained little structural damage. The front and rear doors were locked when firefighters arrived shortly after 3 a.m., authorities said. `` It was n't an accident with two separate fires,'' said Battalion Fire Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military court today sentenced three prominent Slovenian journalists to prison terms ranging from five to 18 months for disclosing military secrets, a supporter of the accused said. An army sergeant-major who allegedly leaked a classified document to the journalists was given four years in jail by the military court in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most liberal republic, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Donci </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzmanic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kuzmanic </PERSON> is a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the Defense of the Accused, an unofficial group supporting the defendants. The journalists, <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franci </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borstner </PERSON>, the non-commissioned army officer, were sentenced for revealing a document dealing with the deployment and combat readiness of army units in the republic. <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, a columnist for the outspoken youth newspaper <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, chief editor of the same magazine, received 18 months each, <PERSON> Kuzmanic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON>, a journalist working for <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, was sentenced to five months. The closed-door trial, which started July 11, sparked an uproar in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which has emerged as the vanguard of political reforms in this communist country. More than 10,000 people gathered in front of the courthouse to hear the verdict and protest the trial, witnesses said. They carried banners and Slovenian national flags in support of the defendants. Military trials of civilians are highly unusual in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where the armed forces, unlike the police and civilian courts, are under federal control. All three journalists have in past written articles sharply criticizing the Yugoslav army and its leaders and alleging they were plotting a coup in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. Thousands of people attended protest meetings and signed petitions against the trial, widely seen in the republic an army move to intimidate the Slovenian public. <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, the only defendant not held in custody, regularly commented on the trial publicly, saying it was `` a shameful, humiliating court proceeding.'' The liberal Slovenian leadership demanded that the trial be conducted openly, that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers and that they all be released from custody. The Slovenian leadership, along with numerous unofficial groups and prominent intellectuals, also demanded that the court proceedings be conducted in the Slovenian language, instead of <LOCATION> Serbo-Croatian </LOCATION>, which is used by the majority of Yugoslavs. The army rejected all of the requests, citing what they said was the sensitive nature of the classified documents and arguing that <LOCATION> Serbo-Croatian </LOCATION> is the official language of the armed forces.

Investigators Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scientific detective team repudiated research results that seemed to defy natural laws, saying it was `` dismayed'' that the salaries of two of the researchers were paid by a supplier of controversial medicines. The investigators, who included magician <PERSON> James </PERSON> -LRB- The Amazing -RRB- <PERSON> Randi </PERSON>, concluded that `` shoddy science'' but no deliberate fraud was responsible for the inexplicable biochemical results, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, editor of the British journal Nature. The prestigious science journal published the results last month along with an unusual `` editorial reservation'' that noted the `` incredulity'' of experts and said that the lead researcher, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON>, had agreed to the investigation. The investigating team's report, released Tuesday, was based on a week-long visit this month to <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON>'s suburban <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> laboratory, part of a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> medical research institute called <ORGANIZATION> INSERM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> said this week the investigators made `` an enormous amount of mistakes,'' and in a written statement he called the investigation `` a mockery of scientific inquiry.'' The Nature report and <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON>'s statement will appear in Thursday's issue of journal. At issue are results reported by <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> and a dozen other scientists in the June 30 issue of Nature. The researchers studied the reaction of white blood cells, called basophils, when exposed to natural proteins called antibodies mixed into a solution. They said that when the solution was diluted so much that samples of it no longer contained any antibodies, those samples still triggered the reaction in the white blood cells. `` There is no physical basis for such an activity,'' Nature said in its note accompanying the report. The investigators were <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>; <PERSON> Randi </PERSON>, a recipient of a <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> `` genius'' grant who is known for investigating unusual scientific claims; and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, who investigates scientific errors and fraud. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said <PERSON> Randi </PERSON> was picked to look for trickery, and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> because of his tenacity in investigating scientific inconsistencies. During the week with <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> and co-workers, they studied laboratory notebooks and observed repetitions of the experiment. The notebooks and observed experiments showed that results were inconsistent, the report says. The investigators, noting that the June 30 results have been interpreted as supporting homeopathic medicine, said they were `` dismayed'' to discover that a French supplier of homeopathic medicines paid the salaries of two of <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON>'s co-authors under a contract with <ORGANIZATION> INSERM </ORGANIZATION>. Homeopathic medicine holds that a disease-causing agent, if used in extremely dilute solutions, can be used to fight the disease. Its principles are not accepted by many doctors. In a series of trials in which researchers followed special procedures to ensure they could not influence the outcome, the experiment failed to give positive results, investigators said. In one such procedure, investigators secretly devised a code that identified the samples in each of a series of test tubes. The identifications were enclosed in a specially sealed envelope, which was then taped to the ceiling of the laboratory during the experiment. The day after that was done, <PERSON> Randi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, the envelope showed evidence that someone had tried to look at its contents. The attempt apparently failed, he said. Overall, the investigators concluded that the researchers paid too little attention to preventing contamination and errors in recording the response of the white blood cells. Researchers also failed to explore why the experiment gave negative results on many occasions, and excluded data from such failures in their published analyses, investigators said. In addition, some past results appeared to be questionable, investigators said. <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> blamed negative results on the procedures he said were improperly imposed by the investigators and on overwork by laboratory workers in the `` ordeal -LRB- that included -RRB- awful technical and psychological conditions.'' <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> replied that the added procedures were `` perfectly sensible'' and that the performance of lab workers showed no evidence of decline. The June 30 paper also reported positive results from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The investigators said they knew too little about the conditions of those experiments to evaluate them.

 A week's worth of payment receipts from nearly 12,000 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> customers disappeared in transit somewhere between the telephone company and its bank, according to baffled officials. The customers paid their phone bills at 90 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branches in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> area during the first week of July, but <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> does n't know which customers to credit because the stubs are lost, officials said Tuesday.

Asked what will happen if customers ca n't find their copies of the payment stubs, <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> said, `` We are confident every customer who deserves a credit will receive it.'' During the first two hours of business Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s residence service center received 1,371 calls _ about 200 more than normal, <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> vice president for public relations, said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> picks up the stubs daily at a designated point at the bank's downtown headquarters. `` Those stubs came back downtown -LRB- from the branches -RRB-, where they were to be picked up by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` They were not picked up by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Panel Says 16-Year-Olds Should Marry Without Consent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government advisory commision says 16-year-olds in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> should be allowed to marry without their parents' consent. The <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the law requiring parental consent for those under 18 who wish to marry can easily be avoided by determined teen-agers. It said the current law is illogical and should be repealed. `` It appears that the present consent requirement is ... of doubtful benefit to the very children it is trying to help,'' the commission report said. `` If the marriage takes place without consent, it is quite valid. If consent is refused, the child can apply to the court for consent, which is likely to be granted,'' the commission said. `` In technical terms, therefore, it is difficult to justify the present law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> comprises five legal experts headed by High Court Judge Sir <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beldam </PERSON>. It was established by Act of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 to monitor the law and recommend changes. Its reports carry considerable weight but are not binding on the government. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> is unaffected by the recommendation because it has its own separate legal system. The commission report also said the present consent law does little good, because teen-agers are increasingly living together without being married. Cohabitation resulting from refusal of consent could be `` severely disadvantageous'' to the girl, it said, because courts had less power to protect her than if she were married. `` Parental refusal to consent may simply serve to alienate the child and, since parental opposition is often withdrawn if the girl becomes pregnant, unwanted pregnancies may be encouraged,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 A 7-year-old was electrocuted when she tried to knock a wire from an electrified fence off her mother's leg, police said A detective said a device that reduces normal household current to a harmless level had been plugged in backwards, giving the fence a lethal charge. <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyhowski </PERSON> died Monday night in a field near her mobile home in <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, where she and her mother, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyhowski </PERSON>, were collecting grass clippings to feed to horses, said township Police Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuck </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Zyhowski </PERSON> had tried pull a wagon containing the clippings underneath a 2 -LCB- - foot electric fence surrounding the pasture, <PERSON> Schmuck </PERSON> said A live wire snapped, coiled around her ankle and knocked her down, he said. When <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> took off her thongs to use them to knock the wire off, her right arm touched the wire, knocking her to the ground. Her head then came into contact with the wire, said County Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brajdich </PERSON>. With her head and arm both touching the wire, a circuit was completed and she was electrocuted by the 100-volt current, he said. `` The little girl was obviously trying to help her mother, and she told her to stay away,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmetko </PERSON>, a friend of the family. <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a family friend who arrived just after the accident, went to the house and pulled the main plug to the fence. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattern </PERSON>, an electrical engineer who examined the fence after the accident in the western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> community, said such a fence normally would carry 40 to 45 volts, which causes no more than a slight shock to a human. `` It's the kind of thing that should n't have done what it did,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. County Detective <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Paden </PERSON> said a device known as a fencer normally reduces the 110-volt, continuous household current to a 40-volt current pulsating in one-second intervals. But the plug was in backward, giving the line a lethal 105-volt continuous current, he said. Dr. <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wecht </PERSON>, the pathologist who performed the autopsy, said most fatalities require more than 240 volts, but there can be deaths at lower levels. `` There is a great variation when it comes to children,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Zyhowski </PERSON> suffered burns on her hands and legs. She was listed in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monroeville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> was `` quite a hero as far as I'm concerned.'' `` She was smart, too,'' he said. `` She tried to use the rubber-soled sandals. The other witnesses told us she also warned her 3-year-old sister and another child to stay away. That was quite a feat for a 7-year-old.''

 A growing number of countries are enacting discriminatory laws and travel restrictions to fight the spread of AIDS, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> study. `` We're seeing an increase in the use of coercion, quarantine and criminal prosecution against AIDS victims,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON>, an associate professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's becoming a syndrome of blaming the victims. <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> presented highlights of the study Tuesday at the 10th National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum. Many of the laws are based on irrational fears that AIDS is a `` foreigners' disease'' and not a worldwide problem, according to the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. One of the countries with the greatest use of criminal statutes and coercive measures to penalize AIDS victims is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON>, also director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and Medicine. `` We found at least 50 criminal prosecutions of people with the HIV virus and uncovered at least a dozen more statutes for quarantine, isolation or criminal prosecution of people -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have among the toughest laws to combat AIDS, according to the study. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> tests all returning citizens for AIDS, including soldiers, and keeps 150 people in perpetual quarantine. Soviet officials recently passed a law calling for compulsory screening of all AIDS high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users, homosexuals and prostitutes and may test foreign diplomats. The survey, which was sent to health officials in every country, found that 45 percent of the 77 countries that responded have AIDS legislation, the first time health officials around the world have developed laws for just one disease, <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> said. The study also found that 21 countries have established national AIDS commissions or task forces, <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> said. Most disturbing were the study's findings that 24 countries, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, developed immigration and travel restrictions for people with the HIV virus, <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> said. When countries were last surveyed in 1985, none had such restrictions, he said. `` Our fear is that we're seeing an AIDS war where countries are blaming other countries and putting up border restrictions,'' <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> said. `` This could all be part of passport and immigration control in many countries.'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials recommended that countries `` view AIDS as a global problem and not something to retaliate against.'' They also urge countries to enact anti-discrimination and confidentiality laws to protect AIDS victims.

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> zeroed in on law and order today after attacking the ethics record of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intensified his search for a vice presidential running mate as the Republican National Convention drew closer. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, began his first solo campaign trip today with stops scheduled over the next several days in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and the deep South. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> planned to address a businesswomen's group in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, three days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went before the group and unveiled a plan for a child care tax cut. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he would highlight his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accomplishments, including prenatal and child care legislation. Kept close to his home base by official duties, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to tour a prison construction site but called off the visit after heavy rains turned the site into a muddy quagmire. Later, he was to meet with with his anti-crime council and sign legislation imposing stiff penalties on producers and sellers of child pornography. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is highlighting law-and-order themes after coming under attack for his prison furlough program. After some participants committed violent crimes during their release, the program was revised. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday stepped up his search for a running mate, and expanded the list of possible candidates with the addition of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, one of five co-chairmen of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, and a harsh critic of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON> to begin background checks on several prospective nominees, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The winnowing process will include selective polling, said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign spokeswoman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to keep his running mate a secret until the convention, which opens Aug. 15 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during an afternoon news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` are embarrassed and ashamed by some of the things that they see'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He blasted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> III even after two <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials quit because of the attorney general's conduct. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not trying to block the arms-for-hostages deal at the center of the Iran-Contra affair, and he questioned the viability of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s day-care proposal. `` A policy that would require every welfare mother in the country to hire an accountant just does n't make sense,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also criticized the proposal in an interview Tuesday, saying, `` I do n't know what the cost would be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week proposed what he said would be a $ 2.2 billion program that would give tax credits to working mothers, initially targeting those with low family incomes. In a speech Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate wrongdoing by federal officials. He also said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should come under the same law. He said civil penalties as well as criminal sanctions should be used to punish violators. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that under the current system, an official is charged either with a felony or nothing at all. `` This is plainly unacceptable,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenger until last week, met with aides in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to plan for a new phase in this year's political activity. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the transition of some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was discussed, but said no specifics about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role had yet been decided.

<TEXT>
 Gunmen hiding behind a wall outside the estate of convicted Mafia boss <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> killed a reputed mobster today as he approached one of the villa's gates, police reported. Italian news agencies quoted police as saying <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestifilippo </PERSON>, 26, died immediately after being shot in the face and chest with fire from sawed-off shotguns. The assassins fled. <PERSON> Prestifilippo </PERSON> was the sixth defendant involved in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest Mafia trial to be assassinated since the trial ended last December He was one of 456 defendants in the nearly 2-year-long trial in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>. Accused of criminal association, he was acquitted for lack of evidence, a formula which under the Italian justice system is less than full acquittal. Police theorize that various Mafia gangs are jockeying for power after some of the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION>'s top men ended up in prison at end of trial. <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>, nicknamed `` the pope'' for allegedly heading the Sicilian organized crime group's executive `` commission,'' was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by the <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> jury. The court held <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> responsible for the murder of Gen. <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiesa </PERSON>, gunned down a few months after being assigned in 1982 by the Italian government as its special Mafia fighter in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>. The first defendant to be killed after the trial ended was gunned down only a few hours after the verdict. Earlier this month the fifth defendant was assassinated shortly after being let out of prison when his sentence was annulled because of technical irregularities. The trial was billed as a key instrument in the state's stepped up war against organized crime. President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> this week ordered an inquiry into allegations by a Sicilian-based investigating magistrate that the state has lowered its guard against the Mafia and that police are no longer delivering the kind of evidence magistrates need to seek trial indictments against reputed mobsters.

 Twenty-six people have been charged with selling sexually explicit T-shirts, and some questioned whether anti-Semitism was involved in their arrest. Other questions were raised about why bail was set at between $ 10,000 and $ 30,000 for each person and why reporters were barred from the bail hearings. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, executive director of the state's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the bail amounts were an `` outrage.'' `` Jaywalking is more dangerous than these shirts,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Afghan guerrillas killed 18 Soviet soldiers in a clash that left more Soviets dead than any battle fought since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Western diplomats said today. The diplomats also said guerrillas fired more than 150 rockets into the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week, damaging the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and killing or wounding at least 50 people in the heaviest shelling on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in four years. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said one rocket smashed into the right wing of the embassy complex Saturday night, damaging the ambassador's residence and adjoining chancery but causing no injuries. A ministry spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the windows of the buildings were blown out and the roof, kitchen and laundry rooms suffered `` important damages.'' The 18 Soviet soldiers were killed in the battle last week in the province of <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION>, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity. No other details on the fighting were available. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which had no comment on the report, has said that area of eastern <LOCATION> Aghanistan </LOCATION> is no longer occupied by Soviet soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. The diplomats also said a Soviet convoy was ambushed last week by Afghan guerrillas in the northern province of <LOCATION> Jozjan </LOCATION> bordering the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Although Soviet soldiers were reported killed, there were no casualty figures. The insurgents also have been attacking the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the only road linking <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the diplomats said. The guerrillas are ambushing Soviet convoys on the highway in <LOCATION> Parwan </LOCATION> province and taking supplies intended for <LOCATION> Hairatan </LOCATION> on the border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the sources said. The diplomats said the rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have been launched from positions around the city, suggesting the various guerrilla factions are working together and moving closer to the city. Although military installations have been targeted most often, the diplomats said, civilian areas have also been heavily hit by rockets. The April 14 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> accord providing for the withdrawal of 100,000 Soviet soldiers, specifies that half be out by Aug. 15 and the rest by Feb. 15. The guerrillas, who did not sign the accord, say they will continue fighting until the last Soviet soldier is out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the Soviet-backed Marxist government is overthrown. The Moslem insurgency began in 1978. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 at the request of the Moscow-backed Afghan regime.

 An Armenian activist expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> trying to arrange refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for himself and his family, a relative and a friend said today. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said in a statement today that it had started paper work to grant asylum to <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>. An embassy source said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>'s case was being given priority. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a leader in the unsuccessful Armenian campaign to annex an predominantly Armenian region of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, was flown to the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital, <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ababa </PERSON>, a week ago, the sources said. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> was banished to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> last week and brought to the Armenian community for help in resettling, another Armenian exile told The Associated press by telephone from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` Everyone is helping him, there's no need to worry,'' said <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Masras </PERSON>, an Armenian who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 28 years ago and is married to an Ethiopian businessman. She said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> was not available at the time because he was at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> trying to arrange a visa to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> called family members in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> late Tuesday night and said he was in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said his mother-in-law, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> began a hunger strike to protest his `` total isolation'' at the Ghion hotel in the capital of Soviet-allied <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Masras </PERSON>, who said she makes her permanent home in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> was free and being well cared for by fellow Armenians. Mrs. <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> told her that on Tuesday he went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. She quoted <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> as saying a Soviet diplomat in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolgin </PERSON>, assured him his wife, their three children and other relatives wishing to accompany him in exile would be allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> told her he was taken from the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on July 20 and kept overnight at Lefortovo Prison. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said Soviet agents accompanied him the next day on a direct flight to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, who served 17 years in Soviet prisons and labor camps before his release last year following a government review of political sentencings, was in frequent contact with Western journalists earlier this year when Armenians began a drive to annex the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. He was arrested March 25 and charged with defaming the Soviet state in his reports to Moscow-based correspondents. Soviet authorities have not allowed foreign journalists to travel to the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region since the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> issue surfaced. American and other Western officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week declined to give the expelled nationalist refuge on the grounds that he had not personally requested it. Mrs. <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON> said her daughter, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, was planning to contact <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about joining her husband in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said that as of this morning the American Consulate had not received application for asylum from <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> or other members of <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON>'s family `` But if they should approach us, clearly we're going to move expeditiously to reunite them,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. He said he could not immediately confirm whether <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> approached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Armenians who form a majority of the 162,000 population in the contested region in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> allege mistreatment by the Azerbaijani government. They began a vocal campaign in February to join the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership last week rejected the annexation bid.

<HEAD>Mayor Disbands Police Department In Overtime Suit</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> FLEMING-NEON </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The mayor has temporarily disbanded the police department because of a lawsuit over overtime, even though he's afraid the move would `` attract every little thief within 100 miles.'' Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Seals </PERSON> laid off the department's four officers and one dispatcher at midnight Sunday. He said the layoffs might last almost a year so the town could save enough money to pay off about $ 50,000 in overtime. The mayor said Tuesday that some of <PERSON> Fleming-Neon </PERSON>'s 1,500 residents have started neighborhood foot patrols, and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the Sheriff's Department were providing extra surveillance. He said there had been no crime so far. Police Chief <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and four former officers sued on June 27, seeking about $ 31,000 owed them for overtime. Seals said six other people who had worked for the department could file similar lawsuits, and the city's total liability was between $ 50,000 and $ 55,000. `` It has completely wiped us out,'' <PERSON> Seals </PERSON> said. `` At the present time we just do n't have the money.'' The department's annual operating budget was about $ 61,000, so the layoffs could continue for nearly one year, he said. `` I'm afraid this is going to attract every little thief within 100 miles around here when they realize we do n't have a police department,'' Seals said. A state audit early this year that showed the city owed 11 present and former officers for overtime worked during the past five years. The city proposed a $ 39,500 settlement in February but <ORGANIZATION> Seals </ORGANIZATION> said negotiations broke down. No trial date has been set. The mayor said the city received about $ 11,000 per year from the state to help pay for police operations, and the remainder must come from local taxes. Seals said the state should provide more money for police departments. <PERSON> Fleming-Neon </PERSON>, composed of two former coal camps, is in mountainous southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> training sergeant poked a recruit with a flag pole and banged his nose into a mirror until it bled, and stuck a pen up another recruit's nose, according to testimony at a court martial. Staff Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, 27, is charged with mistreating recruits at <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Air Force regulations strictly prohibit verbal or physical abuse of recruits, and the case is being watched closely by other base instructors who fear it could affect how basic training is conducted. One instructor at the hearing said most of his colleagues support <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. Another training instructor faces court-martial Aug. 18 on similar charges, and a third instructor is under investigation. One recruit testified Tuesday that <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> took him to the latrine, put his face in front of the toilet, flushed it and told him to `` look at his future.'' Witnesses also accused <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> of butting two recruits with his stiff-brimmed hat so hard that the bridges of their noses bled; of making a recruit eat a piece of paper, and of pulling two other recruits by their dog tag chains. The seven-year <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> veteran faces six months' confinement and a bad-conduct discharge if convicted by a panel of four officers. Defense attorney Capt. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>'s practices, especially putting a hat up to recruits' faces, is common and that <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> was merely being a tough instructor trying to command the respect of his recruits <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> banged one recruit's nose against a bathroom mirror and poked him in the chest with a wooden flag pole because he lacked `` military bearing,'' witnesses said Tuesday. Another of the 11 airmen testifying said <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> had stuck a pen an inch up his nose. <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> complained in a pre-trial interview that training at <LOCATION> Lackland </LOCATION> had become more like a Boy Scout camp because of the many restrictions on instructors.

<TEXT>
 Eleven postal workers arrested on charges they tossed nearly 60,000 pieces of mail into the trash were trying to shave a couple of hours off their work day, a prosecutor says. The carriers were arrested Tuesday and released on their own recognizance. Destroying mail carries up to six months in prison and a $ 500 fine. Postal Inspector <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said about 75 percent of the mail _ 44,800 pieces _ could have been delivered as addressed. Sixty of the 59,700 letters were first-class mail. About 5 percent was second-class _ magazines and newspapers _ and the remainder bulk mail. The motive for the dumping was `` to save a couple of hours a day of work,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFeis </PERSON> said Tuesday. Officials said they will deliver the recovered mail after it is photographed. The investigation began after postal inspectors received a tip that a carrier had emptied a mailbag into a trash bin behind a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> post office April 6. Postal officials put a video camera near the bin and between May 18 and June 21 caught carriers in the act, investigators said.

<HEAD>Expansion Healthy, But Inflation Up Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent annual rate from April through June, but inflation shot up at the fastest pace in almost six years, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said growth in the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was down only slightly from a 3.4 percent increase in the first three months of the year. Inflation, however, picked up substantially during the spring, with a price index tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, the biggest advance since a 5.5 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982. This inflation index, which measures a fixed selection of goods, had risen 3.5 percent in the first quarter. Today's report blamed the pickup in inflation on higher costs for a wide range of consumer goods. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The report shows the economy continuing to grow at a moderately healthy pace in the first half of the year, with some slowing more recently. Investment is strong; the real trade deficit is narrowing, and slower growth of domestic demand bodes well for future improvements.'' As to concerns about inflation, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Inflation remains low and under control; there are moderating influences in the last several months that indicate steady growth, but without a return to inflation.'' While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is performing substantially better than had been expected at the start of the year, the more robust growth has triggered inflation fears. Recently, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> warned that if economic activity did not slow in coming months, the central bank was prepared to dampen demand by pushing interest rates up further. Economists worry, however, that if credit is tightened too severely it could trigger a recession next year. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he was not overly concerned by the rise in inflation. He said most of the price pressure came in increases for clothing and energy early in the spring. He said those gains have since been reversed. `` I do n't think this is a sign that we will have higher inflation ahead,'' he said. Today's GNP report was accompanied by benchmark revisions in GNP data over the last three years, part of an annual review to update the data to reflect new information. The revisions substantially boosted growth last year to an annual rate of 3.4 percent, largely because of higher consumer spending. The earlier estimate had put GNP growth last year at 2.9 percent. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration recently revised its estimate of growth for all of 1988 to 3 percent, when measured from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this. Because the economy grew at a 3.25 percent annual rate in the first half of this year, growth could dip as low as 2.7 percent in the second half of the year and still meet the administration's target, which is in line with the expectations of many private analysts Many economists are expecting growth to slow in the second half of the year, in part because of the adverse effects of the severe drought in the farm belt. The drought's impact was already being felt in the spring quarter, reducing total GNP growth by $ 5.5 billion, today's report said. Overall, GNP grew at an annual rate of $ 30.2 billion in the spring quarter, pushing total inflation-adjusted GNP to $ 3.986 trillion in the second quarter. Much of the strength came from a $ 18.9 billion improvement in the country's trade deficit, the biggest narrowing of the deficit since a $ 24.8 billion shrinkage in the first quarter of 1980. Also contributing to growth in the April-June quarter was a $ 14.4 billion rise in consumer spending, which climbed at an annual rate of 2.3 percent. Business investment shot up at a 14 percent annual rate during the spring as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers continued to spend heavily to expand production facilities because of export demands. Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter while imports fell by 6.2 percent. Even housing construction showed some strength in the second quarter, rising by 2.8 percent, partially reversing a 6.5 percent drop in the first quarter. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed GNP growth would slow to a rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent from July through December. `` The rise in interest rates that has already occurred will slow growth in the second half and I am looking for unemployment to rise a little bit as well,'' he said. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Caton </PERSON>, director of forecasting for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, economic forecasting firm, said he was looking for the economy to slow, either on its own or because of inflation-fighting moves on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does n't see some signs that the economy is slowing, then it will move to push interest rates up farther out of fear that inflation could get out of hand,'' <PERSON> Caton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, another private forecasting service, said he believed growth would be reduced by about one-half percentage point in the second half of the year because of the adverse impact of the drought. He said the higher prices consumers will have to pay for food will reduce the amount of income they have to spend on other items.

 Vandals may have tormented an African antelope found dead in its pen at the Pueblo Zoo with a broken back, zookeepers said. The body of the male beisa oryx was discovered Monday by workers reporting for duty. `` There's a strong possibility that the animal was teased and irritated, and -LRB- it -RRB- ran into the fence and broke its back,'' <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` There were some people in the zoo during the night.'' Senior zookeeper <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said vandals apparently climbed over the zoo fence Sunday night and `` threw benches into the moat, broke a window and strung some pipe into the moat.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said a new mate for the zoo's female beisa oryx will cost about $ 500. The <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> appealed Tuesday to the City Council for more money for the zoo. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said the zoo needs better fences, among other items. `` We're concerned about the animals' safety. It could help if they put up some barbed wire'' atop the fence, she said.

 An Irish teen-ager who stowed away on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer with the help of sailors was hospitalized today after she apparently went into convulsions while being taken to a return flight to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, officials said. Five sailors accused of helping the girl cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> aboard the USS Conyngham remained in custody, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The girl, who <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said is 16 years old and who <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> officials said is 15, was found Saturday evening aboard the guided missile destroyer when it arrived after a 10-day cruise from <LOCATION> Cobh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. She was being flown Tuesday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> when she became ill, and the plane made an emergency stop at an airport near <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said today. <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> said the girl complained of nausea and went into convulsions but was expected to be released from a hospital in the <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> area today. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said she would continue her journey to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> today. The girl had been treated at a hospital for dehydration and seasickness after she was found aboard the <LOCATION> Conyngham </LOCATION>. She reportedly told officials she was orphaned at the age of 13 and wanted to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to get a job, but officials said they have located her mother in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> identified the girl as <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, 15, from the port city of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>. She is the eldest of four children. Her parents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, who had reported her missing, declined comment Wednesday. A police spokesman who spoke on condition on anonymity said Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> has run away several times previously and once had to be brought home from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The destroyer had made a courtesy visit to <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> harbor and was opened to the public, police said. The girl spent 10 days inside a small passage aboard the ship. The passage, 2 -LCB- feet wide and 15 feet long, houses electrical cables and passes over the ship's refrigeration units near the galley. Some sailors apparently brought the girl food and water during the trip, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said today he did n't know what caused the girl's illness Tuesday night. `` When the medical evaluation is complete, she will continue her return to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and will be escorted by an <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION> agent,'' he said. <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said she was given a complete physical by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> doctors before the flight to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and no health problems were found. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents had escorted the girl to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where she met Irish embassy officials. From there, <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION> agents planned to take her to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Five sailors from the ship have been jailed for allegedly helping the stowaway. No charges have been filed yet, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The maximum penalty for aiding an illegal entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is five years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine, officials said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` is not good for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' or for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the Central American country, but declined to comment on a report that he had authorized covert activity to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. However, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` I am told it was the subject of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefings.'' He declined to elaborate. `` I am not going to coment on anything in the nature of covert operations,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters who questioned him as he opened a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> that was unrelated to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Asked whether there was any way he saw that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be removed from power, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I should n't be commenting on that. Certainly, he is not good for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, good for our relations.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny the published report that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this month authorized covert activity aimed at forcing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal from power. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did say that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently reassured deposed Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to restore democracy in his country. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration would have been required by law to notify congressional intelligence committees within 48 hours of a new covert action finding or decision. But he refused to say whether those panels had, in fact, been told of an undercover plan against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as reported in a story published in today's editions of The Washington Post The story said that while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had given the go-ahead for the covert activity, no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action was imminent and paramilitary action, such as a kidnaping, was unlikely. The Post reported that, according to administration and congressional sources, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> informed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> of his action. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted a well-placed source who said no military action was imminent but declined to discuss any details of the covert plan. Another source said it appears the authorization involves activities that fall short of a paramilitary operation to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, such as kidnaping him. According to the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees have been briefed on the action. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did confirm during today's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on July 15 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the Panamanian was receiving a medical examination. But he would not confirm that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had informed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> of a new covert action effort, as the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The president called him in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> simply to reiterate his support for President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and his continued commitment to freedom in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. When asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also had discussed covert operations with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the spokesman replied, `` We never discuss covert activities. ... I would just say the discussion was limited to the points I mentioned. ... There's been no changes in policy and no new actions taken.'' Pressed further on this point, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't fine-tune it any more for you without violating my rule about not commenting on intelligence matters. The administration since June 1987 has been making efforts _ including a series of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whom it previously had considered a Central American ally. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> maintained today that the sanctions `` are having an impact, and we anticipate no change.'' Among the actions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are the freezing of its assets and the invocation of the emergency legislation authorizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to bar the payment of taxes to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by businesses with operations there. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The administration this spring sought to negotiate a deal under which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would agree to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in return for dropping the indictment, but the deal fell through.

<HEAD>Miss Teen California Official Questions Contestant's
Disqualification</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s contestant in the Miss Teen USA pageant was disqualified after four competitors accused her of sneaking out of her room to visit her boyfriend after curfew, a local organizer says. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>, director of the Miss Teen <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pageant, said Tuesday Miss Teen USA officials told him that four contestants had written a letter accusing <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> of violating the 11 p.m. curfew. Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was allowed to participate in the televised pageant Monday night but was disqualified for rule-breaking, said pageant spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, who declined to specify the infraction. However, pageant publicist <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON> said after the Monday night telecast that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> had violated curfew. The 51 girls in the contest were chaperoned and required to abide by a number of rules during their three-week stay prior to the pageant. Guy questioned whether the word of four of Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s competitors was sufficient to disqualify her `` They're just girls competing for a title. What do they know?'' he said. Miss Teen USA officials refused to comment whether other contestants had reported Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> for breaking curfew, Ms. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` This is between the pageant and the contestant. This is n't for the public domain,'' she said. `` She did n't break any law.'' Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s family also declined comment. Meanwhile, the new Miss <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said Tuesday she did n't think Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s disqualification detracted from her victory. `` I'm really proud of where I am,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, a 16-year-old who wants to either to be a dentist or to counsel children about drugs. `` It was a wonderful experience, it was such a confidence-booster.'' It was the second time in six weeks that controversy has interfered with a beauty contest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. As the winners of the Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest were being announced in a televised pageant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on June 13, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, unfurled from her bosom a white silk banner that read `` Pageants hurt all women.'' She was hustled off the stage.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Election-Year Child Care Expansion Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> inched forward on the politically potent child care issue Wednesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee approved a $ 2.5 billion initiative designed to expand and improve day care. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Human Resources Committee approved the Act for <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill, on a voice vote with no audible opposition. But the vote followed a pledge by committee Democrats, the major force behind the bill, to try to work out a bipartisan version of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> before it reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, sponsor of a less expensive rival child care bill, called for the bipartisan cooperation after declaring that `` we're just playing politics.'' He urged committee members to approve the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill `` and then we'll sit down and work this thing out and do what's right for families and children.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> proponents agreed to talks but made no promises. `` He's laid open a very interesting challenge,'' said committee chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` Whether we're going to be able to meet it or not is a real question.'' `` He has my commitment for a solid, good-faith effort,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., chief sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill `` I'm hopeful we can do something. Maybe we wo n't be able to.'' Three-quarters of the money under the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill would help families making less than 100 percent of a state's median income pay for child care. The remainder would go to states for capital improvements to day care centers and homes, staff training, staff salaries and administrative costs. A national advisory committee would develop minimum safety and staffing standards which states would have to adopt, and only homes and centers conforming to the standards would be eligible for the federal money. Some Democrats would prefer that the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill be passed intact, reasoning that a presidential veto could only help their candidates on the campaign trail this fall. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and other Republicans are seeking a more modest bipartisan bill that <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates can tout in an election season colored by family concerns. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> complained that the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill would cost an enormous amount but would n't do much to ease the national day care shortage. He said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> would subsidize only 700,000 day care slots, while <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> alone needs 1 million. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s own bill, one of a dozen proposals pending on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, would provide $ 250 million to states to expand or improve care, including aid to poor families; $ 100 million for liability pools; and $ 25 million for capital improvements. States would have to develop and adopt their own standards. Businesses would receive tax breaks for starting day care centers. If the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor in its present form, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said he would offer three to four weeks' worth of amendments `` because there are that many criticisms that can be lodged'' against it. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., said the most efficient way to get child care money to people who need it would be through tax credits, as in several pending bills and the plan proposed this week by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and others said a tax credit would n't help improve day care quality nor would it be of sufficient help to the neediest. They said day care costs an average of $ 3,000 a year per child _ far more than the credits being proposed _ and the credits would only arrive once a year, during tax refund season, after families had already laid out money for child care. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> canceled a work session Wednesday on its similar version of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure is mired in controversy over whether federal money should be available to the substantial number of day care programs affiliated with churches or synagogues. The committee tentatively rescheduled the work session for next Wednesday. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bills have been rephrased to make sure that such programs are eligible for federal money, as long as it is not used for religious instruction. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and other groups contend the provision violates the constitutional wall between church and state.

 Police arrested 20 garbagemen Wednesday as 1,200 of their colleagues continued a five-day strike to protest the end of a popular television series, a news agency reported. Municipal officials in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> that the workers' refusal to collect garbage could spread disease.

The series `` Ramayana'' is based on the story of Lord <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>, a legendary warrior-king in Hindu folklore. An estimated 100 million people have watched the program each week since it started in January 1987. It has been called the most popular Indian TV series ever, and irate viewers have been known to stone electricity offices after unscheduled power cuts interrupted its screening.

 A drought ravaging large tracts of central and eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is killing farm animals and shriveling crops, and officials fear that mountain villagers could be starving by autumn. `` My fields are bare. My cotton and lotus roots are dead. This year we wo n't even have a fen -LRB- penny -RRB-. It's time to live on wheat and sweet potatoes,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuelian </PERSON>, a 39-year-old farmer and father of two from <LOCATION> Xiangfan </LOCATION>, a town in northeastern <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province. A trip this week through four counties in <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> and the province of <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> revealed bone-dry reservoirs, parched rice paddies, stunted cotton and sesame fields, and corn that had died on the stalk. Wells for drinking water contained nothing but mud. Many rivers had run dry. In a <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> village, all the vegetable fields had been abandoned, baked by the sun into an earthen jigsaw puzzle. Peasants said they would eat only grain this year. In another, a water buffalo went through its death throes. Villagers said the beast died from thirst. A mile away from <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s fields, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> was selling her paltry harvest of watermelons on a country road. The melons were the size of baseballs and tasteless. `` Some of my relatives have already gone to the city for work,'' she said. `` If there's no work, they'll just ave to beg.'' Officials in <LOCATION> Xiangfan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, provincial capital of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>, said the drought was the worst in 50 years. In the town of <LOCATION> Fang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, historians reported that not since 1578, in the Ming dynasty, had their town seen such a blight. Peasants have dubbed the drought-stricken area `` han baozi,'' or the `` dried bun'' _ the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> equivalent to the Dust Bowl in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Official Chinese reports say the drought began in May and has hit eight out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 30 provinces. In some areas, such as <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> provinces, however, the disaster began in February, soon after the Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival. `` Since the Spring Festival, we have n't had one good rain,'' said <PERSON> Tao </PERSON> <PERSON> Weile </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Shiqiaozhen </LOCATION>. `` Since May 28, all together it's rained for 10 minutes.'' Officials in <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> said 3 million out of the province's 55 million people were having problems getting drinking water. Newspapers say millions in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> provinces are without potable water. <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> officials reported damage to rice, vegetable and cash crops. In all, about half of the province's 9 million acres of agricultural land has been hurt by the drought, they said. About 70 percent of the peanut and sesame seed crop has been destroyed, they said. And out of the 2.3 million acres of rice planted, the drought has affected half, they said. At least 25 percent of the crop was expected to be demolished. Other provinces have reported difficulties on a similar scale, according to the official press. `` The problem here is that the drought has lasted for such a long time. The peasants in some areas have planted their fields three times, but once they get a bud it dies,'' said <PERSON> Zeng </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanrong </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Zeng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiuzhen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>'s Agriculture and <ORGANIZATION> Husbandry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said they were worried that starvation would hit areas of northern <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province. Other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed similar fears about <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> provinces. `` Right now, the key goal of the province is to ensure that everybody has enough to eat,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said. `` We are struggling to provide the basic necessities.'' To fight the drought, officials in <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xiangfan </LOCATION> said work teams had been sent to affected areas to dig wells and carry water in buckets to the parched fields. And trucks carrying drinking water have been sent to hard-hit areas. Pumps and electrical generators have been sent to the countryside to help transport water from the few reservoirs that are n't dried up. Officials in <LOCATION> Xiangfan </LOCATION> said peasants who are unable to produce sufficient grain to meet contracts set with the state will be relieved of the burden so they can concentrate on growing enough food to eat. Under the agricultural reforms that have occurred in the last decade, peasants contract with the state each year to produce a certain amount of grain. Anything they produce above the quota, they can keep or sell on the free market. Vegetables and cash crops, such as tobacco, can all be sold on the market. <LOCATION> Xiangfan </LOCATION> officials also reported that factories and other work units had sent old clothes and cans of food to the drought-stricken areas.

<HEAD>Drought Bill Would Provide $150 Million to Tobacco Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Taxpayers would provide an estimated $ 150 million in disaster payments to tobacco growers under pending drought-relief legislation, a policy departure already drawing fire from anti-smoking forces. `` This is a step out of line with the ordinary no-net-cost'' program of price supports for tobacco, `` but it's because of the special situation of the drought,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tobacco and peanuts subcommittee. `` I certainly think it's a bad idea,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, director of Action on Smoking and Health, one of the nation's major anti-smoking organizations. `` To be providing $ 150 million because a crop that kills people is damaged, and spending less than 1 percent of that on educating people about the hazards about tobacco is really an example of having priorities upside down,'' <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said the provision was in no way an effort to bypass `` the normal economic operation'' of the tobacco program, in which no tax money, outside of administrative costs, is supposed to be used for price supports. Under 1983 farm legislation, tobacco lawmakers agreed to a provision requiring growers to finance their price-support system themselves, in contrast to other farmers who receive government subsidies. The law, which remains in effect, forbids the use of taxpayers' money for tobacco price supports except for $ 15 million in administrative costs. This `` no-net-cost'' compromise with anti-smoking forces has been the focus of a series of controversies since then. Anti-smoking forces contend that a complex 1986 law enabled the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to arrange a $ 1 billion, taxpayer-financed bailout of the tobacco price-support system without violating the letter of the law. Rose, an outspoken House champion of tobacco growers, was able to incorporate language into the drought relief bill that seeks to make clear that the envisioned disaster payments for growers are not a violation of the no-net-cost agreement because they are not actually price supports. In the last major drought that hit American farmers, in 1983, there were no disaster payments for tobacco growers, even though the crop of burley tobacco produced primarily in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was badly damaged by sun and a shortage of rainfall. But the disaster that befell the 1983 crop was followed by the 1986 bailout legislation that anti-smoking forces say violated the spirit if not the letter of the no-net-cost agreement. An effort last year by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, to allow tobacco exporters to benefit from a $ 1.5 billion export enhancement subsidy program, by attaching a special provision to the omnibus trade bill, was defeated after anti-smoking forces complained. They also oppose the current provision. There is no way to know precisely how much of the $ 6 billion drought bill would be devoted to tobacco payments because the extent of damage to the crop is not yet known. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff economist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> told lawmakers in a note: `` Of $ 1.6 billion in payments for non-program crops, some $ 150 million can be imputed to tobacco.'' The drought bill has been moving through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at high speed. The House version of the measure cleared its committee hurdle on Wednesday and is floor passage is expected by the end of the week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is also planning to act on the legislation before the weekend. Farm lawmakers from both houses said they are aiming to meet in a conference committee next week to fashion the finished product and send it to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk before they go on their summer recess Aug. 11. A number of lawmakers who usually are critics of farm programs said that they were not familiar enough with the legislation to make a judgment on its provisions. They indicated they had not heard of the tobacco provision. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` when you are doing something like this you can not discriminate against any crop. Asked if he considered it a violation of an agreement, he said: `` No.'' But he also noted that under a 1985 law farmers must have purchased federal crop insurance to be eligible for disaster payments but that provision has been waived under the drought bill. `` So that's a violation,'' he said. `` There are a lot of violations of agreements and previous understandings that are brought about by the circumstances. It's an agreement until the circumstances change.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said he did not want to address the tobacco subsidies issue in the midst of the drought, but vowed to speak out on the question in 1990 when the next farm program is drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Asked if he considered the topic of tobacco subsidies a particularly touchy one on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said: `` I certainly do n't think it should be off limits any more than any other subject should be off limits.''

 A woman who tried to kill a cocktail waitress in 1980 to divert suspicion from the Hillside Strangler escaped from prison by cutting through four fences with pruning shears, an investigator said today. <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, 31, broke out of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> about sundown Tuesday along with a woman serving time for drug offenses, <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>, 28, said <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON>. Their trail led through dense brush to a highway, where a tracking dog lost the scent, <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> said. There were no immediate clues to whether the pair had outside help, he added. Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> was convicted in 1981 of trying to strangle <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Breed </PERSON>, 26, in a <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> motel so authorities would think the Hillside Strangler who killed 10 women in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> was still at large. Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> had said she was in love with <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to the slayings of two college students in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> and to five of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> killings. Authorities said she became enamored of him after his arrest. <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON> is serving seven consecutive life sentences at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> planned to kill Ms. Breed in a fashion similar to the Hillside Strangler slayings but that Ms. Breed escaped. Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> was serving a life sentence for attempted murder; Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> was serving time for drug manufacture and possession, officials said. <PERSON> Veltry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said both were in medium security before being reported missing at a head count. Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> was due for release next Tuesday, but the state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> was seeking her in a previous escape on which <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had no details. Miner said the pair cut through four cyclone fences, each 10 feet to 12 feet high and topped with barbed wire. Investigators believe pruning shears were used in the escape. Tools assigned to Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>'s and Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>'s unit were missing, Miner said. `` Where they cut them, there's no way anybody would see them ... unless they were making a special patrol,'' he said. `` There's no surveillance in that area.''

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today met with the secretary-general, but said his country will not declare a cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war until direct talks are held with Iranian officials. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> shall not be stampeded into making a hasty step under the present circumstances,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said as he entered <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters for a meeting with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` We believe the first step and starter of constructive talks is face-to-face negotiations between the two parties under the auspices of the secretary-general,'' he said. `` If <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does not accept that formula, it means they are not sincere about peace,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` wants to be sure that we are making real, durable and comprehensive peace'' to end the 8-year-old war. As he spoke, heavy fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces drove Iraqi troops out of southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and fought <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for control of a town in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claimed 1,200 Iraqis were killed or wounded. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed its forces shot down an Iranian F-5 warplane over the southern front. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its military shot down two <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes. The tough stand by <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, who requested the current round of cease-fire talks, could signal difficult going in the negotiations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has opposed direct talks, but has left the door open to possible direct contacts if requested by the secretary-general. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said the talks initially would be separate and he would mediate between the two sides. But he said he preferred direct talks and may request them later. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said today he hoped to be able to announce the date for a cease-fire next week, along with other dates for implementation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan to end the war. He also said he would raise the issue of foreign hostages held by a pro-Iranian faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I think they may assert their possible influence in order to have this problem out of the way for both humanitarian and political reason,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. Nine Americans are among the hostages. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> held a first round of talks this morning for one hour at the secretary-general's residence near the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The secretary-general's spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, said the unannounced meeting was held at <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s residence for `` convenience.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> then held a second meeting at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of trying to sabotage peace efforts with attacks he said involved the use of chemical weapons. `` We said -LRB- to Perez de Cuellar -RRB- that if -LRB- the Iraqis -RRB- continue their attack, we will give them a lesson that they wo n't forget,'' the Iranian minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, said after twice meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also was to meet today with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said he discussed with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cueller </PERSON> a timetable for implementing the year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to accept last week. `` We also talked about the recent escalation of the war on our border with the Iraqis,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he dispensed with formalities and began peace talks Tuesday, one day ahead of schedule, because <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> had already arrived. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> discussed implementation of Security Council Resolution 598, which was passed unanimously on July 20, 1987 and demands an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. The plan also calls for withdrawal to internationally recognized borders, prisoner exchanges, peace negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> quickly accepted the resolution last year. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s announcement of acceptance came after a string of battlefield defeats that began in the spring Before meeting the secretary-general, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was trying to sabotage the peace process by in the past week invading <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and using chemical weapons `` in a large scale.'' `` The war is still going on very seriously,'' he said, despite <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s claim it was withdrawing from all Iranian territory after a weekend offensive. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said his talks with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> were `` constructive'' and covered the steps to carry out a truce and peace plan. Meanwhile, two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> teams were at work in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, one laboring over truce details, the other inquiring into the prisoner-of-war situation. The cease-fire would be monitored and supervised by about 250 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops.

 A newlywed couple who vanished in April, their luxury auto left running in a downtown alley, are alive and well and have contacted their parents from a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> location, police said today. <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, 22, had been the subject of an exhaustive two-state investigation. Investigators had noted that some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance _ the couple had been secretly married a week earlier and talked about trips to exotic locales _ indicated they had planned to vanish. `` We have information that the parents have heard from <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> both by letter and by telephone,'' Commander <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> of the Police Department's youth division said at a news conference today. `` We are disheartened that we'd expended so many man-hours'' on the case, <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> said. He added police may try to recover costs of the investigation. Police said they believe the couple is in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area. The <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> families notified police this morning that they had heard from their children, police said. `` The parents are en route to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' said police department spokeswoman <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicini </PERSON>. Police said they did not suspect foul play in the couple's disappearance They refused to comment today on why the couple dropped out of sight or on what they might have been doing in the four months since. The couple were returning from a visit to Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s grandmother in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, on April 2 and had planned to stop for dinner in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> before heading for <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION>, about 40 miles outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Acquaintances told police the two were saving money for a trip before their car was found in the early evening of April 2, keys still in the ignition and most of their belongings undisturbed. Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> also had bought $ 600 worth of clothes and made some entries in her diary about trips to exotic locales, friends told police. In June, police leared that a book, `` Hidden <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>: The Adventurer's Guide,'' was checked out March 29 on <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s library card, fueling speculation that they might still be alive. Friends at <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a small religious school, flooded downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with posters of the two the weekend the couple was reported missing and held daily prayer vigils for weeks following the disappearance. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, a psychology major, was scheduled to finish his course work at <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in August. He also was a cadet major in the <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> at the school and would have been commissioned as a second lieutenant May 15. His strong record in ROTC would have earned him a spot in helicopter flight school in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> next year. Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, whose parents live in <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was scheduled to graduate in December with a degree in literature.

 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> computer network, called the fastest public network in the nation, on Wednesday began passing information among six supercomputer centers and researchers at nearly 200 universities. The network, which replaces a slower system operated by the foundation, is able to transmit 1.5 million bits of information each second, the equivalent of 50 pages of single-spaced typewritten text, the foundation said at a news briefing. The network allows participants to share research findings. Its speed is exceeded only by some private networks, the foundation said. The network `` is a major element in our national technical development,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON>, the foundation's assistant director for computer and information science and engineering. `` With this in place, we expect that scientists and researchers will find new ways to work together on multidisciplinary and cross-regional research projects.''

 Hundreds of firefighters battled a fast-moving wildfire today that forced 500 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> from their homes, while crews at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> fought the worst forest fire outbreak there since the late 1800s. `` As the fire passes one area, the engines are moving ahead and trying to get ahead,'' fire spokesman <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said of the blaze that destroyed four homes and damaged four others in rural subdivisions west of <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, S.D. The fires, fueled by drought, were among blazes burning in eight Western and <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states, where tens of thousands of acres of forest, brush and meadow have gone up in smoke. The other states with major fires are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where a 1,500-acre blaze forced two dozen people from their homes. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> planned a helicopter tour of Yellowstone for this afternoon to survey the devastation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest national park. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> was to visit <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s Grant Village section, scene of some of this week's heaviest firefighting. Firefighters also kept watch on a 6,000-acre blaze burning six to 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION>. The blaze posed no immediate threat to the famed geyser, but officials planned to use helicopters today to start backfires with a napalm-like substance to slow its advance. The fire in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was reported Tuesday afternoon, and rapidly consumed 1,800 acres of forest and meadow in the southwestern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> area that's home to 90,000 people. `` There were areas where you might have a hundred acres go up at once,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Homann </PERSON>, another fire spokesman. One firefighter was treated for burns to the neck, a firefighter and a resident suffered smoke inhalation, and another resident was hurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident, but none of the injuries was serious, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. The fire also burned four vehicles and destroyed a bridge. Crews made progress overnight and more than 500 firefighters were on the scene this morning, fire officials said. Four helicopters and an airplane dropped water and fire retardant to protect homes. By early today, the fire was 50 percent contained despite light wind, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it creates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind by sucking in oxygen,'' he said. To make matters worse, winds were expected to pick up today, temperatures were expected to reach almost 90 degrees and no rain was forecast. Most of the evacuees in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> found lodging with friends and relatives, said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. About 60 families responded to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appeal for people to open their homes to evacuees, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We're spending more time now coordinating between family members to let people know where they're staying,'' he said. Some family members were separated in the confusion of the evacuation. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, about 500 firefighters remained on the lines near <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a camping and store complex about 15 miles southeast of Old Faithful that was evacuated last weekend. Fire also closed the road from the village to the park's southern entrance and closed the <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> campground. It was expected to take a couple more days to finish off the 10,000-acre <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> blaze, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>, a park spokeswoman. The fire is the only one of 13 fires being actively fought within park boundaries. Two fires straddling the park and adjacent national forests are being suppressed from the forest side only, officials said. Park policy is to fight natural forest fires only if they threaten people or structures. In all, about 83,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres have been blackened. Unusually hot, dry conditions this summer have left <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> tinder-box dry. `` The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the late 1800s,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplinger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official coordinating firefighting.

<TEXT>
 A man who telephoned his ex-girlfriend as many as 100 times an hour and rammed her car from behind was given probation and ordered to stop bothering her after he pleaded guilty to a felony retaliation charge. Undeterred by her repeated rejections, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Herd </PERSON>, 23, called the 25-year-old receptionist at home and work continuously between July and September 1987. `` I tried to do it -LRB- to break up -RRB- gently, but he would n't let me,'' the woman said Tuesday. After prosecutors dropped two misdemeanor harassment charges, Herd pleaded guilty to retaliation in an Aug. 20, 1987, incident in which he followed the woman and began bumping the back of her car. When she got out, he threw her to the ground, prosecutor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. A passer-by ended the fracas by spraying Herd with the woman's can of chemical deterrent. State District Judge <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdette </PERSON> ordered Herd to undergo psychiatric treatment and have no further contact with the woman or her family. Herd also received two years of probation called deferred adjudication, meaning that if he completes his sentence he could emerge with no final conviction. Prosecutors likened the case to the movie `` Fatal Attraction,'' in which an obsessive woman refuses to let a man end a brief affair. But Herd's lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, said, `` This is n't ` Fatal Attraction.' This is modern romances.'' He said the victim helped Herd post bond on the first harassment case and even spent time with him just before the Aug. 20 incident.

 An Army lover of a soldier infected with the AIDS virus testified they continued to have sex after she learned of his fatal disease, and two superiors said they urged but did n't order him to abstain. The soldiers were among 10 prosecution witnesses to testify Tuesday at the court-martial of Pvt. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who in March 1987 became the first member of the military to be charged with AIDS-related offenses. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is accused of threatening the health of one male and two female soldiers by failing to use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus. His trial opened Tuesday after more than a year's delay. The prosecution and defense rested today and the case was recessed until the afternoon. Closing arguments were to be made in writing or orally. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is charged with three counts of aggravated assault, three of conduct bringing discredit upon the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and one of sodomy. He faces 17 years in prison, dishonorable discharge and loss of all pay and benefits if convicted. Col. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, the military judge in the case, said he would allow the prosecution to submit previous testimony from an alleged victim of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' because the witness, former Pvt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, could not be located. Both female soldiers testified Tuesday. One was identified by pseudonym <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> after <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> agreed to protect her identity because of her psychological health. The other, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' onetime fiancee, Specialist <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told her in 1986 he had `` an incurable blood disease'' but did n't say it was AIDS until January 1987. She said they had sex weekly from April to October 1986, with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> using a condom about 25 percent of the time. She also said they resumed sexual relations during January 1987, even though she knew <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' test results showed he had AIDS. She said she understood the risk, and that both she and her child, born last year and allegedly fathered by <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, have tested negative for the AIDS virus. Earlier, two Army commanders testified that they advised <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> to abstain from sexual activity after testing positive, but never ordered him to do so or warned him that his sexual conduct could be a crime. Col. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a physician who formerly commanded the hospital at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was distraught at the news that he was infected, reacting with shock. `` He put his head in his hands. I remember he said, ` Why me, why me, why me?''' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' former commanding officer, Capt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulifay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he had counseled <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` strictly man-to-man'' on several occasions between July 1986 and March 1987 about <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' medical condition. He said he advised <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> that `` he should not screw around.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> said she had sex twice with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> in August 1986. She said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had told her previously `` he had a rare blood disease and he could die at any moment,' but did not mention HIV or AIDS. Last April, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> adopted a regulation requiring commanders to warn soldiers testing positive for the AIDS virus that they face discharge or prosecution if they do n't tell sex partners about their condition or use condoms. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> have adopted similar regulations. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' court-martial was delayed pending appeals of a blood test admissibility ruling. In the interim, several other military AIDS-related cases have been tried.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ex-congressman has lost a $ 1.8 million defamation lawsuit against a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> newspaper that published a story about the way he handled campaign funds. Former Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, D-Ore., sued the <ORGANIZATION> Oregonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> lawyer following a 1986 article in The Oregonian questioning <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s handling of more than $ 81,900 of campaign <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> on Friday granted a pretrial judgment in favor of the publishing company which said <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> could not seek damages because the First Amendment protects `` neutral and accurate republication'' of serious charges against a public figure. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> contended in the lawsuit that publication of the allegations about the campaign money had contributed to his withdrawal from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate race against incumbent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> in 1986. The Oregonian article was based on a report prepared by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, an attorney for the Republican committee. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> contended that four statements about alleged mingling of funds and alleged violations of reporting sections of federal election law had damaged his reputation. In a written opinion, <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said one of the alleged defamatory statements was an `` accurate paraphrase'' of <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>'s report and the remaining three were direct quotations from the report. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> voluntarily dismissed <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> as a defendant. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Force </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> lawyer representing <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, said he could not comment on the ruling because <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> had not seen it.

 A judge who got into an argument with an attorney over use of her maiden name in court has been sued by the attorney's client, who believes he lost his racial discrimination case because of the controversy. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said in a complaint filed Monday in federal court that Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> politicized a six-member jury when he initiated the argument with attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON>. The suit said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> shouted at <LOCATION> Wolvovitz </LOCATION> when the controversy erupted July 8 and threatened her with jail if she refused to use her husband's surname and the courtesy title `` Mrs.'' in his courtroom. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, 43, said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> tampered with the jury by polling them on the issue and prejudiced them against his case. After the outburst, <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said, `` The jury belonged to the judge.'' The jury eventually decided <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had not discriminated against <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> and another complainant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, 33. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> have appealed, saying their case `` got lost in the shuffle'' of the Ms. vs. Mrs. controversy. <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> eventually said he would refer to <PERSON> Wolvowitz </PERSON> as counselor and apologized for his remarks after the case went to the jury. A secretary in <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>'s office said Wednesday the judge would not comment on the latest suit. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, who said he is serving as his own attorney because he can no longer afford legal help, asked for a finding that his civil rights were violated and for more than $ 10,000 in damages. He said he is aware that suits against judges are rarely successful. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cindrich </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, noted that `` in general, federal judges enjoy immunity from civil suit, particularly from suits arising out of their judicial function.''

<TEXT>
 A judge on Wednesday ordered doctors to remove a feeding tube from a woman left brain-damaged in a 1983 automobile accident, and her parents called it a `` bittersweet victory'' for her family. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> McCanse </PERSON>, a court-appointed guardian who acted as <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>'s advocate during court hearings and advocated letting her die, said there would be no immediate steps taken to disconnect her from her feeding tube. <PERSON> McCanse </PERSON> said he would join the state in filing an appeal of <ORGANIZATION> Jasper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teel </PERSON>'s ruling. `` In order to protect her I want an appellate court to make the decision,'' he said. `` It is an issue of life and death and we should take it as far as we can.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, 30, who is being care for at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, has no higher-brain functions, a permanent condition doctors call a persistent vegetative state. Her parents, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carterville </LOCATION>, sued last year to force doctors to remove a surgically implanted feeding tube and allow their daughter to die. The judge said he considered their request the `` same as a request for discontinuance of any other form of artificial life support systems'' despite arguments that food supplies may not be cut off. `` We are pleased by the judge's decision,'' <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said. `` We feel it was very brave and courageous on his part. It's kind of a bittersweet victory for my family but it's a victory for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>.'' In emotional testimony during a three-day hearing in March, Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>'s family said she had made clear that she would not want to endure in a helpless and hopeless state. `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would want to live where she could live to the fullest,'' her sister, <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Neosho </LOCATION>, testified. `` And where she can live to the fullest is within the hearts of the people who love her, not in that body being maintained at Mount Vernon.'' Assistant state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> argued that food and water are basic necessities that should not be denied anyone.

 A former town judge should be barred from judicial office for life for soliciting oral sex from a defendant and threatening to have her dog killed if she told, a state judicial watchdog panel said Wednesday. The woman was trying to pay a $ 10 fine for letting her dog run loose when the judge said he'd give her $ 25 for a sex act, said the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>. The woman threw a $ 10 bill at the judge and refused his offer, the commission said. The judge, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON>, 29, was a $ 2,500-a-year part-time town justice in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on the border with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, at the time. He resigned last April 26, a day before the commission held a hearing on the case. The panel recommended to the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court, that <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> be prohibited from holding judicial office again because of the May 1, 1987, incident <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON>, a food service worker at the state's <ORGANIZATION> Ogdensburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>, has 30 days to appeal. <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> did not submit any defense during the commission's hearings, the panel said <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAffer </PERSON>, was on vacation and could n't be reached for comment, said a secretary at <PERSON> MacAffer </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. The judicial panel saidturday. The survey, reported Tuesday by radio station <ORGANIZATION> WEEI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 54 percent support to 37 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential candidates after their nominating conventions. Nine percent were undecided in the survey, which had a margin of error of four points.

 Three East Germans escaped to the West in two separate incidents, but an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> man was caught while riding a subway train headed for the city's western sector, officials said Wednesday. A 15-year-old boy and a 25-year-old man fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a rubber raft across the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said West German border police in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bramstedt </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. They were picked up by a ship, brought to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and taken to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, police said, without giving any other details. An East German border guard fled to the southern West German state of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> the same day, West German border police said. The 21-year-old sergeant crossed over from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wearing his uniform and his service pistol, police said. In <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, witnesses said communist border guards arrested a man who had evaded border police and hopped on a West Berlin-bound subway train Tuesday night. The train had just departed from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Friedrichstrasse </LOCATION> station when it was stopped by the guards, witnesses said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an unusual step, plans to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> one week before the Republican National Convention to address the party's platform committee and `` put his stamp of approval on the platform,'' a campaign official said today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, facing a deadline in three weeks, is also stepping up his search for a running mate, asking candidates if they're interested in being considered and planning to use polling to determine the popularity of different people. The convention opens in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Aug. 15, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't scheduled to arrive that week until Aug. 17, the next-to-last day of the gathering However, deputy press secretary <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said today, he will make a one-day trip to the convention city on Aug. 8 for the platform meeting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of possible running mates was expanded Tuesday when Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> said he had received questionnaire forms that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is using in his search. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already had said that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> would be among those considered. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official said the staff was contacting various people to see if they wanted to be considered. `` Preliminary interest is being ascertained. I think you're safe to assume it's more than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>,'' the official said, insisting on anonymity and refusing to identify who else was being contacted. Within Republican circles, other people considered as likely candidates include Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, even though he has said he is not interested in the job. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON> has been asked to begin background checks on several potential vice presidential picks, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the newspaper that <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON> will report directly to him rather than the campaign staff, to better maintain confidentiality in the information provided by the prospective running mates. Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., co-chairwoman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign committee, said it's clear that some women are being considered `` One of the nicest surprises for me is hearing ... many conservative members of my party talking about a woman on the ticket as a good idea,'' said the congresswoman, whose name has appeared on some public lists of possible running mates. She said other strong candidates include former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. However, Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the selection of a woman was `` possible, not probable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, has said he wants to keep his running mate a secret until the Republican National Convention, which opens Aug. 15 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign spokeswoman, said the vice president `` has expressed an interest in selective polling being done as one aspect of the process'' for winnowing names. `` The polling has not started,'' she added. Despite the public speculation about his running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trained his public focus on another subject Tuesday, delivering a speech at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before congressional interns about the ethical standards he would set if elected president. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be covered by the same conflict-of-interest laws that govern federal officials and that civil penalities as well as criminal sanctions should be used to punish violators. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that under the current system, an official is charged either with a felony or nothing at all. `` This is plainly unacceptable,'' the vice president said. Breaking with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate wrongdoing by federal officials, and said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should come under the same law. `` To exempt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from any of these rules, as does current conflict-of-interest law, is to establish a double standard that breeds suspicion, breeds cynicism and, in my judgment, breeds abuse,'' he said. `` No one, no institution, no body of government should be above the law.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for taking a `` do-nothing'' approach to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal difficulties. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was n't going to comment on matters surrounding <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the subject of an ethics investigation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the current system of federal ethics law is `` a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements, administrative regulations, criminal law. ... In my administration, the code of conduct will be clear and uniform. `` It will reflect common sense,'' the vice president said. `` Nothing will be overly technical. What is intuitively right _ what your conscience tells you _ will invariably be the written rule.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` the threshold for judging ethic conduct in government is not, and should not and will not be whether an appointee has committed a criminal offense, but whether that individual has exercised honest, unbiased judgment and scrupulously avoided any appearance of impropriety ... of conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would create a White House ethics office headed by a senior counselor to the president whose first responsibility would be ethics. He said the office would complement the work already done by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION>, an executive branch agency.

 Ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, spent the night in hiding after their security guards reported armed men cruised past the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> estate, a spokesman said. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, government spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said today he did n't know anything about the report of gunmen and did n't want to comment `` because one of the world's master illusionists is at work. Three cars drove slowly past the house at about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, and security guards stationed at the gate of the sprawling hillside home said they saw guns sticking out the car windows, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. The unarmed guards, who were on foot, chased the cars but could not get a good description because it was still dark, he said. No shots were fired. The Marcoses were awakened shortly after the incident and driven to a site on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. `` They went to a friend's house,'' he said. `` They're still on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> and they'll come back as soon as it's safe.'' A <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> police dispatcher said the incident was not reported, but top <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said police were asked Tuesday to patrol the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> address regularly. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' entourage had received a threatening call and letter last month `` warning us that something untoward will happen to us.'' <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> household had been warned Tuesday of a plot to kill <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Security around the house was increased and the Marcoses were expected to return home today, <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said. The couple have lived in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since 1986, when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted as president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been negotiating his return to his homeland, but in a statement issued by a spokesman Tuesday he denied a published report that he had offered to pay the Philippine government $ 5 billion to ensure his return free from criminal prosecution on fraud allegations. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, family members and associates are alleged to have looted the Philippine treasury of up to $ 10 billion during his 20 years in office, sinking the money into businesses, real estate, bank accounts, art and other holdings. The Village Voice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported earlier this month that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with real estate holdings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The White House said it could not confirm the report.

 Hours after <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> signed an accord aimed at ending this nation's Tamil ethnic war, Indian air force planes began ferrying troops to the Tamil-dominated north. A year later, 50,000 soldiers of the Indian army still are deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The Tamil war goes on, into its sixth year with the death toll at more than 8,000. Resentment against Indian troops grows among Tamils civilians who first saw the foreign soldiers as protectors but who now say they have not done their job. Anger at the peace accord among the majority Sinhalese has spawned yet another revolt and more violence, and both Sinhalese and Tamils are questioning the accord. Sinhalese ire was apparent even before President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> and Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> signed the accord on July 29, 1987. Rioting erupted a day earlier in the capital, and more than 70 people were killed when police opened fire to control Sinhalese mobs. Many Sinhalese complained that the accord went too far in giving the minority Tamils what they wanted _ a separate homeland in the island's north and east. The idea of the peace accord was that <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> would grant limited autonomy to the Tamils in those areas in return for the Tamil fighters putting down their weapons. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor with a large Tamil population of its own, agreed to guarantee the pact by disarming Tamil rebels and protecting Tamil civilians from revenge by the Sinhalese. It did n't work out that way. <PERSON> Velupillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON>, leader of the largest Tamil militia, said the accord was forced on him by powerful <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which sits just 30 miles from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, and he rejected it. By October, <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> were fighting the Indian army. About 2,500 Tiger guerrillas and at least 500 Indian soldiers have been killed. A leading Sinhalese government minister, <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>, surprised many in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last week when he accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of not fulfilling its role. <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> is viewed as the prime mover behind the treaty. `` It is the responsibility of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to see that the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are totally disarmed,'' the lands minister told a panel discussion. `` The Indian army has not performed its job.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Indian Foreign Minister P.V. <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> told their <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the troops will not leave until the Tamils are disarmed. In the island's Sinhalese-populated south, meanwhile, a Sinhalese nationalist group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has killed more than 400 people since the accord was signed. Most victims were minor figures in <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The front has vowed to kill any supporters of the government and its peace accord. Security was strengthened at the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and diplomatic residence on Wednesday after threats from the group, according to a commission official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indian forces have been put on alert for possible violence to mark the first anniversary of the accord. Residents in Tamil-dominated regions said Indian troops imposed a curfew starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday. <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lankan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says the accord has fostered `` southern terrorism.'' Others say Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s party, the largest opposition group, has fueled Sinhalese anger by opposing the peace accord as a tactic to win parliamentary elections expected later this year. A leading <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, <PERSON> Anil </PERSON> <PERSON> Moonesinghe </PERSON>, said last week that the treaty should be abrogated. `` The 1-year-old Indo-Lanka accord has not brought peace. It has brought misery, bloodshed, tears and destruction to this country,'' <PERSON> Moonesinghe </PERSON> said. A Tamil member of <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s government also told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it may be time to reconsider the accord. `` Now that one year has elapsed and since the accord has not done as anticipated, it is time for both governments to take realities into account,'' said <PERSON> Savumiamoorthy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thonadman </PERSON>, the rural development minister. `` The accord does not satisfy Tamils.''

 A federal export program is boosting sales of chicken to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where retailers traditionally have bought low-quality <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> product in large quantities for the low end of the market, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. `` Branded promotion of frozen chicken from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under our Targeted Export Assistance Program is turning this situation around,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The product is clean, packaging is attractive, and our exports of chicken to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have risen 10 percent in the past year.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> was arguing, in testimony prepared for a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> hearing, against the contention of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government promotion of branded products such as chicken and wine gives some companies a potentially unfair advantage.

The program it criticized will spend $ 325 million a year beginning in October, up from $ 110 million this year. `` You would n't dream of buying a bottle of ` generic' wine,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. `` Effective promotion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine in a foreign market means getting a wide range of individual labels and classes of wine established in the local trade.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelowitz </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said the program has been credited with boosting exports of wine to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by 56 percent in the first half of this year. But he said other causes for the increased sales, including the drop in the price of the dollar, have to be taken into account. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said the 12-country <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> dominates world trade in processed foods. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> has won its dominance of the market through a comprehensive barriers and processing and export subsidies,'' he said. `` The Targeted Export Assistance program has given us a way to begin to challenge that dominance.'' Both men testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on foreign agriculture.

<HEAD>Study Finds One-Third of Pregnancies End in Miscarriage</HEAD>

 A new test reveals that most miscarriages happen during the first month of pregnancy, long before women even realize that conception has occurred. `` We can say that the majority of early pregnancy loss appears to be unrecognized,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who directed the study. His work suggests that 22 percent of all pregnancies end spontaneously in the first month, before women know they are pregnant. Another 9 percent result in miscarriages after the pregnancy becomes apparent. The study confirmed what many scientists have long suspected: The female body discards a large portion of its fetuses in the first month or so after conception. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said the body probably rejects fetuses because they are defective. When researchers study later miscarriages in which fetal tissue is recovered, they find that half show gross genetic abnormalities. `` It's reasonable to speculate that the same would be true in these very early losses,'' <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said. The study found that 31 percent of all pregnancies ended before birth, but the true rate of miscarriage is probably even higher, since the test missed miscarriages during the first week after conception. An editorial published with the study in the Thursday issue of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> speculates that half of all pregnancies may end in miscarriage. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, based his findings on a newly available test that spots a pregnancy hormone. The study was conducted on 221 healthy young women who had decided to stop using birth control and get pregnant. The researchers collected urine and checked it for traces of human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced by the fetus. This substance shows up in a woman's urine when the fetus attaches itself to the wall of her uterus, usually about a week after conception. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> noted that many physicians tell women to resume birth control and `` let their uteruses rest'' for a few months after a miscarriage. But he said this may not be necessary, at least after very early pregnancy losses. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said the miscarriages did not mean that a woman could not have children, and almost all of those who had unrecognized miscarriages were able to get pregnant again within two years. Dr. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, who wrote the editorial, said in an interview that `` there are many exciting things'' about the study. He said the test, which is not yet commercially available, may allow doctors to pinpoint more accurately the causes of infertility. For instance, if the test shows that infertile women are having early miscarriages, it will help rule out several possible reasons for their problems. Little said the test should also help doctors check on the progress of test tube, or in vitro, fertilizations.

 <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON>, the prime minister with the longest tenure in modern Thai history, today turned down offers to return to his post for another term, party officials said. One of Prem's closest supporters, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, agreed to take the job. `` The leaders of the five parties agreed that they would nominate me as prime minister and I accept,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, 66, who serves as acting deputy prime minister, heads the <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won the most votes in Sunday's general election. Earlier today, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, a retired army major general and a wealthy businessman, said he supported Prem for prime minister. Although the five coalition parties hold 215 of the 357 seats in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, more lobbying may take place before <ORGANIZATION> Chatichai </ORGANIZATION>'s name is submitted to constitutional monarch <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON> for approval. In the past <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s powerful military and senior bureaucrats were also said to have been involved in the final choice of the country's leader. The other four parties in the coalition are the <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rassadorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement that <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> turned down another term as prime minister was made earlier today by Col. <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kachornprasat </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> said he wo n't accept it, citing personal reasons,'' <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said `` He has upheld democracy for eight years and five months.'' The announcement came after leaders and senior officials of five political parties met at <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s house to offer him the post. The five parties had agreed to form a coalition government to be headed by <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> following the elections. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, a 67-year-old former army commander, called the elections 24 months early after dissolving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, disbanding his faction-ridden coalition government and nullifying a no-confidence motion from the opposition. Under Thai law, after elections the major parties select a prime ministerial candidate, who does not have to be a member of Parliament. Prem, for instance, does not hold an elective office. Television reported that several hours before the parties met with <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> today 3,000 students marched to his house, protesting the naming of a prime minister who had not been elected by the people. Riot police guarded <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s house and the crowd dispersed peacefully, the report said. The new lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to meet Monday for the first time. Traditionally, the first session is presided over by the king. On Tuesday, five representatives from the Student Federation of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which claims 100,000 members, called on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ukrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mongkolnavin </PERSON> to have the prime minister be directly elected rather than nominated.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> agreed today that overhauling of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economy must be accompanied by political reforms `` We have been impressed with your openness to new ideas,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> in a formal departure statement after the two leaders held a brief private meeting and then had lunch. `` We are encouraged by your recognition that economic reforms can not succeed unless acompanied by political reforms as well,'' the president said. He added that decisions to be made by <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' government in the coming months `` will set the direction of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s development over the next decade.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, replying to the president's remarks, said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` will reorganize its economy'' and added, `` This can only be done, we are aware, if the citizens will enjoy more rights, more freedoms.'' `` Therefore, we are modernizing our political system and our political practices,'' he said. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> spoke through an interpreter. A senior administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the two leaders did not discuss the question of possible withdrawal of the 65,000 Soviet troops based in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Several weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had received increasing indications that a Soviet military retreat from its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally was likely. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> gathering on Tuesday that any Soviet troop pullback from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would have to be part of general scaling down of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> began his official talks here, the troop issue was expected to occupy only a small part of his visit as both sides were hoping to stress his efforts to make <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> more open economically and politically. The visit is the first ever by a <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> party leader since the country came under <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rule 40 years ago. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became premier a year ago and was named party chief in May. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has better relations with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> than any other East European country and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expect <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s visit will reinforce those ties. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is likely to emphasize his plans for revitalizing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economy through an ambitious reform program that includes closer trade and investment ties with Western countries. `` We will open <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to both foreign and Hungarian capital,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said Tuesday, adding that he wishes to modernize the country's political structure as well. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is expected to seek improved Hungarian access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets during his visit. On Tuesday, he said that economic and political reform must be carried out jointly because the two are dependent on one another. `` The two processes must be fitted together,'' he said. But he indicated political reform has to be carried out within the framework of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s one party state. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> indicated that it would be a mistake to focus excessively on the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956, an event that greatly aggravated the Cold War and did much to shape Western attitudes toward <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for years afterward. `` The events of 1956 mut not be treated as a matter of everyday politics but as a matter of history,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said Tuesday, speaking through a translator. The Soviet invasion was touched off by a widespread anti-Moscow uprising in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Among the legacies of that era is the continued presence of the 65,000 Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Administration officials have said they would welcome a unilateral Soviet withdrawal but maintain that any such move would do little to alter the East-West power balance because <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> does not border on any <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country. The officials said there had been credible hints recently that the Soviets might announce a total troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The administration was concerned that the Soviets might try to use such a move as a bid to pressure <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries into making withdrawals of their own from the European theater. The administration prefers that force withdrawals be negotiated to ensure that concessions are parallel. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week, visiting <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The latter stop included a 45-minute chat with Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He met with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> after his arrival Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>B-1B Able To Perform Only Half Its Intended Tasks, Pentagon Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s B-1B bomber, already behind schedule in meeting its warfare goals, now will accomplish about half of the job for which it was designed, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> testing official said Wednesday. Asked to give the airplane an overall rating for how well it could perform its jobs of pentrating enemy airspace and surviving counterattacks, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>, director of testing for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It will accomplish about 50 percent in terms of the gross assessment of what it was supposed to do.'' While the plane generally flies and handles well, electronic equipment that enables it to follow a ground-hugging flight path and avoid or confuse enemy radar remains a problem, <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> told a joint meeting of two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees. But even with the problems, the B-1B still exceeds the capabilities of some other planes in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal, he added. Chief among the problem areas is the plane's electronic countermeasures system, which is designed to help the aircraft slip through enemy radar. The system has been unable to handle the job of detecting and processing the range of possible threats from air defense systems, <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> said. The problem is exacerbated by the inability of the electronic system to adapt to the changing nature of radars used for surveillance, tracking and weapons guidance, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has given up on trying to meet all the original hopes for the countermeasures system and is instead focusing on a narrower range of threats, hoping to develop reliable performance against enemy anti-aircraft weapons, he said. `` It's better to have success in a limited area than no success in a large area,'' he said. `` There is no question that it does n't accomplish everything it was supposed to. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is buying 100 of the aircraft at a total cost of more than $ 20 billion. The B-1 program was killed by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who decided that it would be more cost-effective for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to wait for development of the radar-eluding Stealth bomber, due for deployment in the early 1990s. But the plane was revived by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as part of its defense buildup. `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s decision looks better as we keep going through these hearings,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Prepared To Meet With `Responsible Palestinians'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration renewed its offer Wednesday to meet with `` responsible Palestinians'' in an effort to spur <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks, but said it would not retreat from its policy barring direct contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told reporters that `` I hope to have meetings with Palestinians'' when he tours the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next month and makes stops in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` But there is no dramatic new initiative under way,'' he said during an informal interview on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and other officials were responding to questions triggered by remarks of President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, who said in a state-owned newspaper interview that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to talk with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members so long as they are not prominent in the organization. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` There's no change in our policy toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The policy prohibits dealing with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization until it accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and disavows terrorism against American and Israeli citizens. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s trip to the region could be a forerunner of a fifth visit this year by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Before going, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next Monday and Tuesday with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, the senior Soviet foreign ministry expert on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> invited Palestinians to meet with him in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but was snubbed at the instruction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> also refused to approve a proposal that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as part of a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation. On all his trips, however, rumors apparently inspired by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> circulated that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was about to have a meeting in this Arab capital or that with prominent members of the group. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> `` as usual will be prepared to meet with responsible Palestinians on the same basis that Secretary of State <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has offered to do on his trips to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' And yet, the spokesman said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was ` ` very categorical. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the meetings would be held either in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told the weekly Al-Mussawar that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> wanted to meet both with Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and from other countries. While the Egyptian leader supports <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace efforts, he differs sharply with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in insisting on a direct role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the process. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met earlier this year in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the would-be legislative arm of a Palestinian state. One of the Palestinians, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> professor, said he had a `` green light'' from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for the session. Apart from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restraints on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which were imposed 13 years ago, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has barred participation by the Palestinian group in negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His attempt to spur peace talks has stalled over <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s refusal to pledge to withdraw from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and demands by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for a guaranteed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pullout. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s return to the region was predicted earlier this month by Prime Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> after talks here with senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s trip was `` not necessarily'' a precursor of one by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The spokesman added: `` There are not any plans for a trip by the secretary at this stage ... But if there is something to do in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or anywhere else in the world the secretary will do it.'' One of the main issues <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> to take up is the future of the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Violent demonstrations against Israeli control have taken the lives of more than 200 in the last seven months.

 An Armenian activist said he was forced to fly to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> guard after his expulsion from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but he won a promise after a hunger strike that his family could join him in exile in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> that he was being cared for by the local Armenian community and had been assured refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for himself and nine family members. The 39-year-old activist, who played a prominent role in a recent struggle between Armenians and Azerbaijanis for control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, said he had not seen or spoken to his wife since his March 25 arrest. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said he would never abandon efforts to return to his native <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but that he wanted his family with him in exile. He said he had been told by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> authorities that he would be able to leave <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> in a few days and will stay with relatives in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> untili his family can join him. They plan to settle in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where they have other relatives that they have never met, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> was in good health and met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Wednesday to start preparing for his settlement in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. An embassy source told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that the case was being given priority. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>'s wife and family in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also requested resettlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is processing them as refugees. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, who had served 17 years in Soviet prisons and labor camps before his release last year following a government review of political sentencings, was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last week. His expulsion followed the Kremlin's rejection of an appeal by Armenians for annexation of the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. He is believed to be the first Soviet dissident expelled to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s African ally. The unusual action may indicate Soviet concern about how their traditional allies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would respond if asked to take part in a punitive measure against a dissident. Western nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, had refused to accept the nationalist because he was being expelled by Soviet authorities against his will. He had been jailed in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> since March 25 on charges of slandering the Soviet state. The accusations stemmed from his reports to Western journalists on the Armenian campaign for control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. His family was allowed no contact with him since his arrest and did not know his whereabouts until late Tuesday when he telephoned his mother-in-law, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said he had gone on a hunger strike when authorities informed him he was being expelled, and he abandoned it Tuesday when Soviet diplomats in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys that his family would be allowed to join him. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Masras </PERSON>, an Armenian emigre married to an <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> businessman, said the head of the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital's Armenian community brought <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> to her home for help in arranging refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Everyone is helping him, there's no need to worry,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Masras </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, speaking from his room at the Hotel <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, said the local Armenians had been taking good care of him. Calls to the home of <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>'s wife in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> did not go through on Wednesday, but Mrs. <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON> said her daughter managed to call her early in the day and was informed about <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>'s location and plans In what may be a related development, <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday for what the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency described as `` a brief working visit.''

Paycheck, 50, said one of his best friends among the <ORGANIZATION> Hells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Barger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the club's national lresident suffered smoke inhalation, and another resident was hurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident, but none of the injuries was serious, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. The fire also burned four vehicles and destroyed a bridge. Crews made progress overnight and more than 500 firefighters were on the scene this morning, fire officials said. Four helicopters and an airplane dropped water and fire retardant to protect homes. By early today, the fire was 50 percent contained despite light wind, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it creates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind by sucking in oxygen,'' he said. To make matters worse, winds were expected to pick up today, temperatures were expected to reach almost 90 degrees and no rain was forecast. Most of the evacuees in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> found lodging with friends and relatives, said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. About 60 families responded to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appeal for people to open their homes to evacuees, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We're spending more time now coordinating between family members to let people know where they're staying,'' he said. Some family members were separated in the confusion of the evacuation. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, about 500 firefighters remained on the lines near <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a camping and store complex about 15 miles southeast of Old Faithful that was evacuated last weekend. Fire also closed the road from the village to the park's southern entrance and closed the <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> campground. It was expected to take a couple more days to finish off the 10,000-acre <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> blaze, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>, a park spokeswoman. The fire is the only one of 13 fires being actively fought within park boundaries. Two fires straddling the park and adjacent national forests are being suppressed from the forest side only, officials said. Park policy is to fight natural forest fires only if they threaten people or structures. In all, about 83,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres have been blackened.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> beware _ a robot that pops out cups of sizzling french fries in 30 seconds is after you. For 80 cents the `` Spud Factory,'' a high-tech Canadian vending machine, drops a single order of sliced tubers into hot vegetable oil, fries them and dumps the resulting morsels into a cardboard cup. `` One day you're going to drive up to <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and get a hamburger, french fries and a drink out of a vending machine,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, a founder of <ORGANIZATION> Robotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vending </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, which holds the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distribution rights. `` More and more, people are going to be eating high-quality food in vending format,'' said <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>. For 60 years, inventors have struggled to develop a vending machine that can deliver fresh french fries. To be successful, the machine must be able to refrigerate the potato strips while keeping the oil hot. It also must be fireproof. Company president <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> finally found a machine that met the criteria. Operated by a microprocessor, it costs $ 6,500 and is made by <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. For now, the sole user of the `` Spud Factory'' is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, the company installed seven machines at <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, just west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. It plans to install additional machines at three <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval air stations and a hospital. `` The first time I tried it, the potatoes were all broken. But since then, it's been great. They taste real good,'' said <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a food service clerk who visits the machines several times a week. `` My kids love them.'' Marketing director <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said he and his partners are attempting to profit by combining a craze for potatoes with a craze for vending machines. The average American consumes more than 40 pounds of potatoes a year and vending machines make up a $ 20 billion industry. Robotic Vending plans to place 4,000 machines throughout <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before spreading to the rest of the country. With an expected average of 50 sales a day per machine, the company hopes to bring in $ 56 million in annual revenues _ no small potatoes. The company plans to first zero in on larger clients, such as hospitals and stadiums, said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. `` Right now we are the only company in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> that has a vending machine that is certified. Everyone else is using machines that they are basically testing,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. One of those others is Ore-Ida Foods, a subsidiary of H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, which is developing a similar machine.

 At the <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Market </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, shop attendant <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> spent all day Wednesday turning away customers seeking to buy the potent <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION> liquor stacked in the back of the store. `` We're not selling the good stuff until tomorrow,'' she said. `` When the prices go up, that's when we're allowed to sell.'' At the Chongwen Market near Maxims, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiping </PERSON> has been refusing requests to buy famed Zhonghua cigarettes, despite the pile of a dozen boxes near her counter. `` Come back tomorrow,'' she said, with the curt officiousness of a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> shopkeeper. `` Even if you clearly see them that does n't mean they're for sale. On Thursday, brand-name cigarettes such as <PERSON> Zhonghua </PERSON> and spirits such as <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fenjiu </PERSON>, will jump in price by as much as 290 percent. Across <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, stores have been stocking up on the goods in anticipation of the price rise. Shopkeepers said government regulations forbade them from selling the goods before Thursday. The price increase was announced Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or cabinet, and comes as a time of record inflation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Consumer prices in June were 19 percent higher than in the same month last year, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> announced last week. That jump represented the highest inflation rate in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the communist victory in 1949. The previous high was last year when inflation hit 7.2 percent. Shopkeepers in three large stores in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said there had been no panic buying of the brand-name goods for the simple reason that none of the stores was selling them. Only some of the B-grade products, also set to increase in price, were available and were selling briskly. At <LOCATION> Chongwen </LOCATION>, one shop attendant said that in two days he had sold 200 cases of Erguotou Wine, a turpentine-like liquor set to rise from about 50 cents to 65 cents. `` We've got to sell this liquor now,'' said the attendant who declined to give his name. `` Otherwise, when it goes up, no one will buy it.'' The cigarette and liquor price rises are the second major increase ordered this year. On May 10, the government raised the prices of vegetables, pork, sugar and eggs as part of far-reaching price reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and allowing the value of goods to be determined by the market. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily on Tuesday reported that the main reason for the newest price increase was to counteract a flourishing black market in brand-name liquor and cigarettes. Private dealers bribe managers of state-run stores for a chance to buy a large portion of their brand-name cigarette and liquor inventory. The products then turn up on the street at inflated prices. For example, a bottle of <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION>, with an official price set at $ 5.40, would sell for $ 40.50 on the black market. But on Wednesday, the official <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION> price will rise to the black market level. `` The money that really should have come to the country is flowing into the pockets of profiteers,'' the paper said. `` Because of this, after serious thought, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has decided to decontrol the prices of famous cigarettes and liquor.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it would not carry out any other price increases this year so as to curb the high inflation rate. On the eve of another price rise, however, there was some skepticism. `` They're just waiting until everyone forgets that,'' said <LOCATION> Chongwen </LOCATION> customer <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Da </PERSON>, carrying two bottles of wine and two cartons of cigarettes. `` They say they wo n't raise prices, but they will.''

 The publisher of books by such authors as <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Conquest </PERSON> said Wednesday he's selling off his assets to pay creditors. <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a major owner of the 25-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Day publishing company, said he would sell the rights for 1,200 book titles which he estimates are worth as much as $ 5 million.

<HEAD>Americans Eating Their Way to Early Graves, Surgeon General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of Americans are waddling their way to early graves by consuming too much fat, too much salt and washing it all down with too much booze, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general reported on Wednesday. `` Diseases of dietary excess and imbalance'' are among the leading causes of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the report issued by <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. `` Over-consumption ... is now a major concern for Americans.'' The study said that of 2.1 million Americans who died last year, nearly 1.5 million succumbed to diseases associated with diet. `` What we eat may affect our risk for several of the leading causes of death for Americans, notably coronary heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and some types of cancer,'' the report said. `` These disorders together now account for more than two-thirds of all deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The study said that many Americans are too fat, while others fail to get required nutrients such as calcium and iron. And the report repeatedly emphasized the need to cut down on consumption of animal products and replace them with a greater variety of foods, particularly fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Nutrition experts praised the report, predicting that may have an important impact on how Americans regard their diet and on products sold by the food industry. `` This is really the first report by the Surgeon General relating nutrition to health. With his prestige, it could have an influence,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachance </PERSON>, a professor of food science at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a very good report,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRosa </PERSON>, a physician at the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the nutrition committee at the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It endorses ideas that the heart association has been pushing for some time.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the report will encourage companies to develop products that follow the guidelines endorsed in the report. Though the report acknowledges that malnutrition remains a problem in some parts of the world and for certain Americans, it says that `` for most of us the more likely problem has become one of overeating _ too many calories for our activity levels and an imbalance in the nutrients consumed along with them.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said in a forward to the report that while many foods affect health, the major factor in the American diet `` is the disproportionate consumption of foods high in fats, often at the expense of foods high in complex carbohydrates and fiber _ such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products.'' Changes in the diet, he said, `` can bring a substantial measure of better health to all Americans.'' The report, which totals 712 pages and cites more than 2,000 scientific studies from around the world, makes recommendations ranging from the amount of fat that should be in the diet to advice about vitamin supplements. Among the major findings: _ Most people should reduce the consumption of fat, especially saturated fats, such as from butter or untrimmed red meat It suggests more vegetables and fruits, fish, poultry, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. _ More whole grain foods, cereal products, vegetables and fruits should be in the diet The report recommends that dried beans and peas be used as a source of protein to replace some animal products. _ Sodium consumption should be reduced by limiting the use of salt in food preparation and at the table _ Alcohol intake should be reduced to two drinks a day `` if at all. Pregnant women should avoid any alcohol, it said. _ Fluoride should be added to community water systems to prevent tooth decay, and that the consumption of sugar should be limited to avoid dental cavities _ Adolescent girls and women should increase consumption of foods high in calcium, such as low-fat dairy products _ Iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish, cereals, beans and whole-grain cereals, are particularly important for children, adolescents and women of childbearing age `` This issue is of special concern for low-income families,'' the report said. Heavy emphasis was placed in the report on dietary fat, which it said increases risks for obesity, some types of cancer, gallbladder and heart disease. `` Dietary fat accounts for about 37 percent of the total energy intake of Americans, well above the upper limit of 30 percent recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' the report said. It said excess cholesterol levels, strongly associated with heart attacks, can be reduced by limiting consumption of foods of animal origin, such as eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry and fish, and increasing consumption of plant-based foods, such as vegetables and fruits. The report said Americans spend about $ 2.7 billion a year for nutritional supplements `` of unproven benefit'' and warned against fad diets or `` magical'' foods promoted with unsubstantiated claims. Over-the-counter vitamins and minerals, alone, represent a huge business of questionable value, the report said. `` An estimated 40 percent of Americans consume supplemental vitamins, minerals, or other dietary components at an annual cost of more than $ 1.5 billion,'' even though such supplements are not needed by most customers, the report said. Americans also spend extra money for products labeled as `` natural'' or `` organic'', even though the study said special benefits of these products `` are not generally demonstrated.'' `` ` Natural' vitamins, for example, often sell at twice the price of synthetic products even though they are chemically identical,'' the report said. `` In some such products labeled as ` natural', only a minor fraction of the vitamin is actually derived from natural sources.''

<TEXT>
 A man sentenced to house arrest after twice being caught dealing drugs from his home has been arrested there again for selling cocaine, police say. Police detained <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, 48, on drug charges Saturday night _ less than three months after he began his prison sentence at his home. `` I guess he duped me like everyone else,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, who had agreed to the sentence, said Tuesday. `` I'll tell you one thing _ this time I'm going to flush him down the toilet.'' When police brought <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> to the stationhouse, he was still wearing the house arrest program's electronic anklet _ a high-tech `` leash'' that broadcasts a signal to corrections officers to make sure a prisoner does not stray from home. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was wearing the device because he had been convicted in May on two counts of dealing drugs from his home. Police said they found cocaine in neatly wrapped plastic packages lying on <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s bedroom dresser during arrests in May and August of 1987. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was supposed to serve a year. `` Every time he was arrested, he was arrested at home,'' <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Senff </PERSON> said. `` That's what struck me as absolutely unbelievable'' about the house arrest sentence. <PERSON> Senff </PERSON> said he was particularly upset about <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s house arrest because of the home's proximity to <ORGANIZATION> Carver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which is about a block away. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s latest arrest came after a confidential informant bought crack cocaine from him at his home with a marked $ 20 bill, police said. Officers, armed with a warrant, searched the house and found 24 cocaine rocks and $ 2,239 cash, including the marked bill, court records showed. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said that after his May conviction, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had the choice of being placed on house arrest for a year or going to prison for three years.

<HEAD>Filipinos Blame American ``Inflexibility'' For Break In Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Filipino negotiators Wednesday blamed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inflexible position for the breakdown of talks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` We felt we were being cheated'' by the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer, said negotiator <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Amatong </PERSON>. The Filipino team decided Tuesday to suspend the talks indefinitely because of what spokesman <PERSON> Leonides </PERSON> <PERSON> Caday </PERSON> called `` substantial disagreement'' over payments for use of the six bases. The Philippine panel is insisting on a $ 1.2 billion annual payment, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the Americans were offering roughly half that. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays about $ 180 million a year for the use of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and four smaller military installations. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> are the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amatong </PERSON> said members of her team also objected to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand that purchases of locally made products and salaries paid to the nearly 70,000 Filipinos employed on the bases be included in the total compensation figure. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> Wednesday blamed the collapse on `` what appeared to be an inflexible <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position.'' `` I'm prepared to entertain any suggestions on the future of the talks,'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> told reporters after meeting for about 40 minutes with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` But we have to be assured that the position given to us by the Americans as inflexible is indeed not inflexible.'' `` Well, we tried,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters. `` We hoped that we would finish. But after yesterday, I do n't know.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government expects to resume negotiations and to reach agreement. `` The talks have been temporarily broken off,'' said <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. `` We do expect them to resume again ... I do n't know exactly when. There have been any number of breaks in these talks.'' About 40,000 American military personnel, dependents and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians are stationed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military's main arms supplier in its 19-year old battle with communist rebels. Talks are held every five years to review the Military Bases Agreement signed in 1947, the year after the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> became independent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and is valid until 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has agreed to honor the current agreement but refuses to say whether she will support an extension beyond 1991, one year before her term expires. Any extension of the agreement after 1991 must be in the form of a treaty ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the bases are essential to protecting <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> from Soviet military expansion.

 An associate professor of communications at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska-Omaha </ORGANIZATION> said he has been denied an opportunity to deliver speeches about <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> because he stutters. The <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> `` said I have something to say but that I could n't say it,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> World-Herald from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where he is spending the summer. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said he had hoped to deliver speeches on `` American Indian Contributions to Democracy.'' The presentation would have been based on his book `` Forgotten Founders'' and other speeches he has given around the country on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said in the interview published in Wednesday's editions of the newspaper. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> released a copy of a letter he received from <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> coordinator. The letter said <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>'s bid was rejected, although his topic was `` interesting and unique,'' because `` most people agreed that your delivery would detract too much from groups' understanding of your material.'' The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, said she could not discuss the details of any speaker the organization turns down for funding. `` Our policy, and that of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>, is not to discuss applications that are turned down,'' she said. `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> -RRB- is going to give details, fine. But I ca n't.'' Potential speakers must present their material to various groups that might invite a speaker, Ms. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. The audience generally consists of such people as high school teachers and librarians, she said. `` We try to certify as much as possible that we will have excellent speakers,'' she said. `` We pull together an audience, and evaluation forms are used.'' About 45 people had expressed an interest in auditioning, and 30 went through the audition process, Ms. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> and three others were not included in the final list, she said. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> released copies of seven evaluations of his speech at the audition. Five of the seven indicated that they believed his speech problem would detract from the speech. The <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> pays speakers an honorarium of about $ 100 and expenses, Ms. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. Private foundations and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> fund the committee. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said he has n't decided whether he will take action against the committee. He said he never considered his stuttering to be a problem. He teaches classes at <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> and delivers lectures throughout the country. `` If, for example, everyone had their -LRB- the committee members' -RRB- attitude, I would n't be able to do anything,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said she believes <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> has the advantage in a public discussion over his exclusion from the speakers' bureau. `` He can talk about it,'' she said. `` I ca n't. No matter how tempting it is to explain our side, I simply ca n't do it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said, however, that the humanities committee does not discriminate on the basis of handicaps, race, gender or religion.

Cable systems that operate in cities representing at least 51 percent of the nation's population are eligible under the new rules. There was some disagreement this year because the academy does not require panelists to see all the shows nominated in the category they are judging before they vote. `` We felt all nominations should be viewed by the judges, which the academy does not do. But the academy has been very flexible and we hope to work out our differences next year,'' said <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. The cable industry will continue to hold its own ACE awards, since the Emmys represent only certain prime time programming. The next ACE awards are scheduled for Jan. 15, 1989. The Governors Award this year will go to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>, of Hanna-Barbera, for their many animated shows. Their cartoon series range from `` The Jetsons'' to `` The Flintstones'' to `` The Smurfs.''

<HEAD>No Documents, No Charges, Says Iran-Contra Judge</HEAD>

 A federal judge said Wednesday some of the charges against former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> likely will be dismissed if prosecutors can not make arrangements for release of key secret documents in the Iran-Contra affair. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said at a hearing on a motion to postpone <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s Sept. 20 trial that he ca n't make any decision until `` we know what it is we're going to try.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> indicated, however, he would not agree to a suggestion by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> that some of the 16 charges be set aside until the release of classified documents can be worked out and that the trial go ahead on the other charges. `` It's now apparent that the government will not provide the documents I've ordered be disclosed to the defense,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` Unless that isue can be reconciled by various stipulations or agreements ... it's clear to me ... that the conspiracy counts will have to be dismissed.'' `` I've sent every signal I could that I have great doubts as to whether these counts can be tried,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. The judge said he wanted documents that show what covert operations were involved in the diversion of profits from the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who in high places knew about them and how <PERSON> North </PERSON> was involved. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that in the next two days he would go back to government intelligence officials and try to get documented answers to the questions <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> posed. The judge has already ordered that classified documents related to the case be made available to the defense, but intelligence agencies have refused to turn over some key papers, citing national security interests. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he was ready to go ahead and try most of the counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and request that charges of conspiracy, theft of government property and wire raud be tried later. That would leave charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> involving obstruction of justice, personal enrichment and tax fraud. Former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are due to have separate trials on Iran-Contra charges. No dates have been set. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers want his trial postponed until next March. They say Sept. 20 is too close to the presidential election and would not allow them enough time to prepare a defense. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, told Wednesday's hearing the trial would be affected by the presidential campaign. He noted statements by speakers at last week's Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, including presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s pledge not to issue pardons in the Iran-Contra affair if he is elected. The judge noted that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had been giving speeches around the country and said, `` He certainly does n't want to keep it out of politics.''

 The crowd gave <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> a standing ovation for his colorful couture show on Wednesday, which featured his flawless tailoring and technique, and his daring use of color. It's hard to imagine anybody else sustaining such interest through a series of 25 tuxedo suits. Each one was perfection, whether with short skirts, long skirts, long pants, spencers or long jackets with white satin wing lapels or black kimono lapels. The sparkly vineyard embroideries with bunches of grapes plastered onto bolero jackets and necklines of satin cocktail suits and evening gowns nearly brought the house down. The show in the Intercontinental Hotel ballroom attracted celebrity clients including first lady <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, film star <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deneuve </PERSON> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> socialite <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>. `` It was terrific, like watching an artist at work,'' said <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>. `` His clothes are works of art. It's like going to a museum.'' The suits were classics, wearable anywhere. Shoulders were amply padded but not offensively so. Besides his favorite short and straight skirt, Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> has adopted another shape and length: a longer length to just below the knee, flared or pleated below the hip. Daytime trousers looked straightforward and sporty, although they could be dressed up by one of the mink or ruddy fox coats, or a taffeta coat, another great Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> item for winter. With raglan or puffed sleeves, these superb taffeta numbers sometimes had bright, contrasting linings. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s use of zingy color was a far cry from his sober looks of past seasons. <PERSON> Cerise </PERSON> and pink teamed often for day or evening, and brightly piped suede suits came on in turquoise and rust, red and green, rust and navy. It was a huge show _ 134 outfits _ and just about everything was totally elegant and wearable, from the beautiful Chanel-style dresses with touches of white and gold buttons to the marvelously draped chiffons with a feminine high-waisted look to emphasize the bust. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> went colorful as well. The double-breasted cafe au lait smooth wool suit was excellently tailored and shown with a bright orange satin blouse. A violet leather fitted jacket with brown mink shawl collar and cuffs over a lean tobacco short skirt made a perfect dressy daytime outfit. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> used an original touch in some of the day and evening wear: Chinese-lantern puffs on the sleeves. Some of the evening wear was appealing, especially the beaded and embroidered black dresses. But short evening gowns with puffy skirts and plenty of fancy touches looked young and fussy. Lecoanet-Hemant, a youthful pair of designers celebrating their 10th haute couture season, showed they have all the technique it takes to make couture. But it seems a shame to waste so much fabulous fabric and detail on what sometimes ends up looking more like abstract sculpture than clothes. Topped by spiraling hats, the dresses and suits with tiny skirts, enormous stand-out basque bottoms on jackets, huge cone-shaped tops sometimes looked overladen with details, and too zany for comfort. Nevertheless, the miniskirts, draped and `` laced'' through rhinestone loops, the exotic cut-out patterns and the superb satins and rich Indian fabrics were well worth looking at, if hard to wear. <PERSON> Paco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabanne </PERSON> also seems to concentrate more on showy art objects than clothes, and aptly showed at the Decorative Arts wing of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>. He is famous for his chain-mail effects, and obliged an audience eager to be entertained. <PERSON> Rabanne </PERSON>'s sequined dresses, too, were larger than life, often dazzling in all colors of the rainbow, reflected prism-like from the sequins. Not everything was impractical. <PERSON> Rabanne </PERSON> also showed some very attractive rubber raincoats and a good-looking reversible rubber bolero lined with sequins worn with a black corduroy jumpsuit.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Strengthen Position During Truce</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s military has been able to take `` irreversible advantage'' of the four-month-old cease-fire with the Contra rebels, strengthening its overall position at a time of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid cutoff to the insurgents, a Contra leader said Wednesday. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, former Contra military commander and newly elected member of the rebel political directorate, called for a renewal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid as a signal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to `` establish democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, who joined <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and three other members of the directorate at a news conference, said the rebels have no intention of violating the truce despite <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s contention that it has helped the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The rebel leaders spoke as Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, introduced legislation to provide the rebels with $ 30 million in military aid and $ 27.1 million in humanitarian assistance through March 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., also has introduced a bill to aid the rebels, calling for a $ 47 million package that includes $ 20 million in lethal assistance In pleading for a resumption of aid, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> asked, `` How can I send the combatants to the field for a prolonged period of time without any rounds of ammunition, surrounded by <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON>?'' Since the cease-fire went into effect, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` have been reinforcing their military positions. They have been rebuilding their military garrison. They have been relocating their forces in key positions ... They have been receiving $ 40 million monthly from the communist bloc.'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> described these advantages as irreversible. The rebels, meanwhile, have received no military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since late February. Three weeks after the cutoff, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras reached agreement on an interim cease-fire but talks since then on arranging a final settlement have broken down and no new negotiations are scheduled. Aid to the rebels since last April has been limited to humanitarian items, including cash deliveries for food purchases. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the rebels want to return to the bargaining table but that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> must first make good-faith gestures signaling a willingness to establish democracy. The last round of talks was held in June and ended in failure, with each side holding the other responsible for the outcome. Last week, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> resigned as commander of rebel forces along the northern front after his election as a member of the directorate. His new role calls for coordinating decisions of the directorate related to military activities. He will be responsible for strategic planning and supervising the carrying out of military operations but will no longer be involved in day-to-day activities and will not have troops under his command. His election to the directorate has caused controversy because he is the first military man to be chosen for that role. One reason he had been denied a political voice until now was his prior career as an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> under the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family dynasty.

<HEAD>FAA Can't Keep Up With Dollar-Driven Airlines, Congress Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is `` scrambling vainly to catch up'' with a rapidly changing airline industry whose decisions at times are driven by dollars and not safety, a congressional study said Wednesday. The 183-page report by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> suggests that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provide the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> with additional funds and press for more inspectors and air traffic controllers as well as organizational streamlining that places more emphasis on safety. Unannounced inspections and periodic in-depth inspections of both large and small airlines by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` are indispensable tools for ensuring public safety'' but currently the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> does n't have enough inspectors, said the report. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> is a nonpartisan agency that helps <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deal with complex and often highly technical issues. The report on air safety was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, said the report's call for `` stable and adequate funding'' for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is among its most important findings `` For the balance of this century, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s funding needs will continue to increase if we expect to maintain the high level of safety which the public demands of aviation,'' said <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> at a news conference. But he acknowledged those funds may be hard to find `` under the enormous deficits that have piled up in recent years.'' The study notes that the safety record of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines `` ranks among the best in the world'' but it added that the intense changes in the industry and bitter competition among airlines poses safety concerns. `` While airline officials are concerned about safety, financial considerations drive many industry decisions and will continue to do so as long as strong competition exists among the airlines,'' the study concludes. At the same time, it said, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has been `` hit hard by budget cuts and personnel reductions -LRB- and -RRB- has fallen behind in both numbers of staff and levels of technical expertise.'' It said that while human errors account for a large majority of airline accidents, `` <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> programs to understand human error and enhance controller, mechanic and cockpit crew performance are inadequate.'' At the same time the growth in air traffic resulting in increasingly crowded skies at major airports `` could outstrip the capabilities of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- traffic system'' if it is not modernized. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is in the midst of updating its air traffic control equipment, but that is not expected to be completed until the late 1990s. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s shortcomings are particularly worrisome at a time when closer monitoring of the aviation industry is required, the report suggested. Competitive pressures have placed increased emphasis on keeping down costs at all airlines, resulting in the elimination of `` some of the layers of the old safety system,'' the report said. Some airlines have `` pared back'' their safety departments, many have lowered hiring standards, increased pilot and mechanical duty time, reorganized or cut wages, the study said. While the `` cumulative impacts on safety of these decisions are difficult to quantify'' there is evidence that airline executives are under intense pressure to focus on meeting only the minimum safety standards required by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and not go beyond those requirements, the report suggested `` While ` safety comes first' is the instant response of airline executives when asked the basis for management decisions, this universal answer masks wide variances in airline corporate cultures and operating procedures,'' the report continued. `` Safety first means one set of corporate guidelines -LRB- to an economically strong air carrier -RRB-. ... It means something else entirely to a financially strapped airline that must choose between discretionary maintenance of its aircraft and purchase of additional airport -LRB- landing -RRB- slots because it can not afford both.''

 An offer by a senior Iranian official to help free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was dismissed Wednesday by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as dated and not an indication <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> wants to open talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, said freeing the nine hostages was `` a humanitarian issue'' and not subject to bartering with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> concerning Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has petitioned a tribunal in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, to recover the assets, which have an estimated worth of $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the Iranian offer has `` resurfaced many times over the past two years, and each time we have noted that there can be no connection between the hostages and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claim in The Hague.'' <PERSON> Hojatolislam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament and acting commander in chief of its armed forces, said Tuesday he would help obtain the release of the American captives if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> returned frozen assets `` No deals,'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, promptly retorted. Iranian assets, including military equipment and some funds in American bank accounts, were seized by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979 after Iranians sacked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and held its American occupants hostage. Many of the assets were released in January 1981, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> freed the Americans after a 444-day ordeal. A special tribunal in The Hague, which arbitrated claims by the two governments, has jurisdiction over the assets that remain forzen, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. In the last few weeks, as part of an effort to persuade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to end the war in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sent indirect messages to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> proposing talks after an eight-year break in relations. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> publicly has suggested a dialogue with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Apart from the 7 -LCB- - year war, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said other issues they wanted to discuss were the hostages and terrorism Mindful, however, of the Iran-Contra arms and money fiasco, the officials have insisted they would deal only with `` authorized'' Iranians. After secretly shipping missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986 in an effort to promote `` moderation'' and to free the hostages, the administration discovered it was dealing with Iranians who could not _ or did not want to _ alter Iranian policy. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> suggested there would be no formal reply to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s proposal, apart from the public dismissal of the offer `` I do n't know that there's any reason to reply any more directly than we have already this time, publicly,'' he said. `` We've replied to similar remarks by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, by Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Hosein </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> -RRB- in the past.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official added: `` Our position concerning hostages is, as always, that that is not something that one can negotiate about, that you ca n't make deals.'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday, `` We will not accept any linkage between the fate of our hostages and outstanding claims. ... <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has the prime responsibility to get them released.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the latest proposal did not seem connected to current efforts at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to impose a cease-fire in the gulf war. Nor, he said, was <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s proposal taken here as an official response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overtures for talks. `` I do n't see any indication that it's that kind of a response,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said.

 Newspaper editor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> will replace <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s news division, network sources said today. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said he is leaving because of differences in `` style, personality and priorities.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, confirming a report in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said his departure after four years, during which he helped lift the network in the ratings, was `` a mutual decision by myself and -LRB- NBC President -RRB- <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with other <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> executives for a network meeting. The appointment of <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>, former editor of The Courier-Journal of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and the The Des Moines -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- Register, was to be announced later today, said the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> is a part-time general news executive with <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and editor of the Ames, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said in an interview that `` it's time for them to get their own guy in there,'' referring to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. `` It's been in the works for a while,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said. `` Things have changed. It has n't been all that fun lately. I've been there four years. It's a difference in style, personality and priorities. `` I'm very proud of what we've accomplished _ onward and upward.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, was hired by then-NBC chairman <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON> in 1984. Under <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s tenure, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> improved its standing in news broadcasts, with the `` Today'' show moving into first place and `` NBC Nightly News'' gaining status. But several attempts to start a prime-time news program failed and the `` Nightly News'' slipped from the top ratings at a time when the network's prime-time programming was particularly successful. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said the change was effective immediately, though he would stay to help aid the transition. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> would n't say what he was going to do after leaving <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. Network executives whom the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> did not identify said <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s problems were related more to inside politics than to the ratings decline. Among key <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> people considered strong critics of <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> are anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, former executive producer of the `` Today'' show who left <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ago and is now producing `` USA Today: The Television Show'' for <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>. According to the Times, <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>'s criticism centered on <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s lack of a journalism background.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee said Wednesday they remain unconvinced that consumers will benefit from a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposal to change the way telephone companies are regulated. Panel members said they were open-minded about the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to lift limits on the profits of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies and instead set a ceiling on prices But they said they have yet to see evidence that the change would benefit ratepayers. `` The only thing that we know for certain is that this plan has raised more questions than it answers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., subcommittee chairman AT & amp; T and the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies have been lobbying hard for a change from profit regulation to price caps, but others in the telecommunications industry fear the proposal would give these large companies too much advantage over competitors. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effect next year unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts to block the plan or pressurs the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to drop it. At the panel's hearing, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> vice president of marketing services, supported the plan as it applied to his company. Limits on prices rather than profits would `` in all probability result in greater price decreases or smaller price increases'' by creating incentives for cost-savings by allowing the company to be more competitive and innovative, <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON> said. But as applied to the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, the proposal fails to assure that charges for connection to the local phone networks will drop with declining costs, he said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is the nation's largest long-distance company, serving about 70 percent of the market The rates for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, the only long-distance company whose interstate business is federally regulated, set the pace for the rest of the industry. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 long-distance company, also opposes price caps for the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies because of the local companies' control of access to the local phone network. Local access charges already are excessive, and higher charges would simply raise long-distance rates for consumers, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies and thus consumers would benefit from the same encouragement for cost-savings, efficiencies and innovation under the price caps proposal. At a minimum, local phone rates would go up 3 percent less than inflation, he said. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Competitive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 100 long-distance companies, said lifting profit regulation on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies would be a mistake. `` Deregulating monopolies is just not good policy,'' <PERSON> Dundon </PERSON> said. Without adequate controls, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would be able to undercut competition by charging below cost for some services and making up the difference with higher prices on essential services, he said. The Bell companies, given more flexibility, could tailor service arrangements for the large long-distance companies at the expense of the smaller companies. `` The price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitive environment, where market forces would exercise a check on excessive or predatory prices,'' he said.

<HEAD>Military Court Sentences Yugoslav Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military court Wednesday convicted three Slovenian journalists of disclosing military secrets and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five to 18 months, a supporter of the accused said. More than 10,000 Yugoslavs awaiting the verdict outside the courthouse roared with disapproval when they heard the news, and some chanted anti-government slogans. An army sergeant-major who allegedly leaked a classified document to the journalists was given four years in jail by the military court in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most liberal republic, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Donci </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzmanic </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the Defense of the Accused, an unofficial group supporting the defendants. Journalists <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franci </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borstner </PERSON>, the non-commissioned army officer, were sentenced for revealing a document dealing with the deployment and combat readiness of army units in this northern republic. <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, a columnist for the outspoken youth magazine <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, its chief editor, received 18 months each, <PERSON> Kuzmanic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON>, a journalist working for <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, was sentenced to five months. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency also reported the sentences. According to the verdict, read to reporters by chief judge Col. <PERSON> Djuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlaisavljevic </PERSON>, <PERSON> Borstner </PERSON> had removed the `` top secret'' stamp from the military document before giving a copy of it to the journalists. <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> planned to use the information for his articles, <PERSON> Vlaisavljevic </PERSON> said. The closed-door trial, which started July 11, caused an uproar in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which has emerged as the vanguard of political reforms in communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The court released Borstner, <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> from custody pending an appeal to the supreme military tribunal in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The verdict is completly unfounded and represents a travesty of justice,'' <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON> told his supporters. <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, the only defendant not held in custody, regularly commented on the trial, saying it was `` a shameful, humiliating court proceeding.'' The defendants alleged the trial was rigged and that the verdicts were decided before the proceedings began. As the journalists emerged from the courthouse, the crowd cheered and carried them away on their shoulders, a witness said. `` We will struggle till the end to defend our freedom,'' <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> said. `` I will not speak much, because in this country every word could be used against you.'' The journalists have written articles sharply criticizing the Yugoslav army and its leaders and alleging they were plotting a crackdown in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted a court statement saying that <PERSON> Bortner </PERSON>'s motive in leaking the document was that `` he saw the document as a danger to his Slovenian people.'' `` By giving the document to <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, he hoped that its contents would be disclosed to the Slovenian leadership,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. Military trials of civilians are highly unusual in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where the armed forces, unlike the police and civilian courts, are under federal control. Thousands of people attended protest meetings and signed petitions against the trial, widely seen in the republic an army move to intimidate dissidents, some of whom have demanded that the government resign for mismanaging the economy. The liberal Slovenian leadership demanded that the trial be conducted openly, that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers, and that they all be released from custody. The army rejected all of the requests, citing what they said was the sensitive nature of the classified documents and arguing that <LOCATION> Serbo-Croatian </LOCATION> is the official language of the armed forces.

<HEAD>Economy Shows Strong Growth, But Spurt In Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent annual pace from April through June, but rising food, energy and clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 4.7 percent, its highest level in almost six years, the government reported Wednesday. Some private economists worried that the big jump in inflation was signaling the concluding stages of the current long economic recovery and could well result in a recession some time next year. The White House dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary deviation. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the growth rate in the gross national product, the economy's total output of goods and services, was down only slightly from a revised 3.4 percent increase in the first three months of the year. But inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982. The GNP price index had risen at 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which is counting on a strong economy this year to keep the White House in Republican hands, hailed the strong growth numbers and dismissed the higher inflation rate as an aberration. `` Prices have temporarily picked up but they are not a harbinger of more general inflation,'' said <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economist `` The price increases are reflecting the drought and higher import prices because of the fall in the dollar.'' Others were more concerned. `` We have had a definite upturn in the inflation rate which is a by-product of our long expansion,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The demand side of our economy is now exceeding our ability to produce, which is causing price pressures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has already pushed interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the central bank stood ready to tighten further if inflationary pressures did not abate. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he agreed with the administration's assessment that the spike in inflation in the second quarter was likely to moderate in coming quarters. He said it was produced primarily by higher clothing and energy costs, which have already declined since spring. He predicted that food costs would moderate as well, especially if more rain falls in the parched <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. All economists agreed that overall growth during the second quarter showed the hoped-for movement away from a consumer-led expansion to export-led growth. In fact, 62 percent of the increase in GNP in the spring came from an $ 18.9 billion narrowing of the country's trade deficit, the biggest improvement since early 1980. `` We are very lucky to get a growth picture that is this well-balanced at this stage of the business cycle,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the strength in exports, the economy was propelled in the spring by a 14 percent increase in business investment as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers rushed to expand production facilities to keep up with growing export demands. Growth would have been even stronger in the second quarter but the drought reduced farm production by an estimated $ 5.5 billion at an annual rate, which shaved one-half percentage point from the GNP increase, according to <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON>. This was more than offset by an increase in auto production, which added 1.3 percentage points to GNP growth in the second quarter, <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said. The GNP report Wednesday was accompanied by benchmark revisions to GNP data going back the past three years. Those revisions generally showed stronger growth than originally believed, in part because of higher consumer spending. The revisions showed the economy grew 3.4 percent in 1987, up from a previous estimate of 2.9 percent GNP growth last year. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has revised its estimate for growth this year to 3 percent, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1987, up from an administration forecast of 2.4 percent at the beginning of the year. In the first six months, the economy grew at a 3.25 percent rate and many forecasters said they expected growth to be around 3 percent for the remainder of the year. This growth performance would be a far cry from the recession many analysts were once predicting in the wake of the record October stock-market plunge. Instead, the economy has performed strongly this year, helping to push the unemployment rate down to a 14-year-low of 5.3 percent in June. Overall, GNP grew at an annual rate of $ 30.2 billion in the spring quarter, pushing total inflation-adjusted GNP to $ 3.986 trillion in the second quarter. Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter while imports fell by 6.2 percent. Even housing construction showed some strength in the second quarter, rising by 2.8 percent, partially reversing a 6.5 percent drop in the first quarter. But analysts said rising mortgage rates would depress housing further in coming months.

 Mother Nature's birds are interfering with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s birds and now the war is on. Flocks of mourning doves feeding along <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>'s new runway are threatening the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s P-3 Orion antisubmarine aircraft. Some have been sucked into the engines, and officials fear it might cause a crash. One of the aircraft had to abort a takeoff last week when two of its engines were damaged by birds. The doves also have caused a reduction in the number of flights from the base alongside the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. For the rest of this week, a team of volunteers, including dentists, firefighters and security officers, will take up positions along the runway armed with a variety of noise-making explosives. They hope to scare off most of the birds. They'll kill those they do n't. `` You just ca n't use pyrotechnics alone,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` The birds get wise and figure out it's just a bunch of noise that's not hurting anybody.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has received permission from state and federal officials to kill the mourning doves, known for their plaintive cries, if they ca n't be driven away. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosling </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kare </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanctuary </PERSON>, or BEAKS, who is known as <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>'s `` Bird Lady,'' said there are other ways of scaring off the doves without killing them. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and other places, they put hawks on tether lines,'' she said, offering to take some of the predators to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAS </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would need a lot of tethered hawks to clear the runway quickly. The alternative, he said, would be to suspend air operations until the doves are scared away. The volunteers will be along the runway during daylight hours through Friday in hopes of solving the problem, said <PERSON> M.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, airfield manager. The best times to scare away the doves are early in the morning and at dusk, when they feed, he said. The bird problem began Friday when the new runway opened, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. That day, the tall grass alongside the runway was mowed and grass seeds dropped to the ground. `` The doves move from field to field, when there's food available. The word gets out among birds, like people, that there's a free meal,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials are hopeful that adding grass catchers to mowers will prevent the problem in the future. The grass catchers would pick up the grass seeds that attracted them to the runway in the beginning, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Suspends Talks With Qatar Over Unauthorized Stinger Missiles</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has suspended military and economic talks with <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> to protest the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> sheikdom's unauthorized acquisition of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats said Wednesday Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the suspension would remain in place until <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> returns the missiles to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What we have done is to place on hold a number of agreements that were under consideration,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We consider it very much in the interests of developing the solid relationship with <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> that those missiles be returned soonest. And we've made that very clear,'' he added. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> himself made an official protest when he visited the <LOCATION> Qatari </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Doha </LOCATION> last month. Another official, speaking on condition he not be named, said <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> had been seeking several military and economic agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the purchase of weapons. `` We told them everything is frozen,'' he added. `` Relations are now correct but cool.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have any defense cooperation with <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> but considers the country important as a member of the pro-Western <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> which includes <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials wants to get the Stingers back in order to see their serial numbers and determine where <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> got them. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> first learned of the Stingers' presence in <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> last March, when an embassy official saw one of the rockets in television footage of a military parade. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they do not know how many of the shoulder-fired rockets <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> has. They have speculated that <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> was given the Stingers by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which in turn captured them from the U.S.-supplied Afghan rebels fighting against the Soviet occupation of their country. Other officials say <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> may have bought the missiles on the black market, although that possibility is less likely. Strict controls apply to the sale of the Stingers, which are considered of great value to terrorists because they are portable and highly accurate. In response to questioning, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not considering recalling its ambassador to <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> who heads a tiny mission of five Americans. Such a move would not be in the interests of maintaining relations with the pro-Western oil state, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. The ambassador `` is the only one with access to decision makers'' there, he added. <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> contends it needs the missiles for self-defense and has rejected any attempts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to even see them.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is asking Cubans for more hard work and fewer illusions as he looks ahead to the 30th anniversary of the day he took power. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> approaches the Jan. 1 anniversary with about 60 percent of the island's 11 million people too young to remember the fervor of his fight. But he praised the new generation for its revolutionary enthusiasm. In his three-hour, nationally televised speech Tuesday night, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> predicted hard times ahead and urged Cubans to work hard and stop dreaming of such luxuries as an eight-hour work day. The good news in the speech marking the July 26 start of his five-year battle was that Cuban troops may come home from their 13-year involvement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` We will happily receive our combatants,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, and welcome them back to `` the battle for development of our country.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said troops would stay there `` until the minute'' that an agreement is signed in the U.S.-mediated talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He gave no time frame but said the pullout will not be sudden. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has never spoken so explicitly about bring Cuban troops home. He frequently mentioned the Jan. 1 celebration of the day he marched into <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> 30 years ago to take power from dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>. He spoke at length about his communist government's progress, citing economic gains, public works and the revolution's vaunted public health system. Before 1959, he said, there were 180 doctors in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the nation's largest city after <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. Now, he said, there are 2,470. Even more important, he said, is the fact that `` these new generations of Santiagans are even more enthusiastic and more revolutionary than the generations that preceded them.'' The degree of that enthusiasm could be crucial in the coming years of hardship <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> predicts because of bleak prospects for improvement in the foreign exchange situation. Just two years ago, at the third <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said laziness, absenteeism and inefficiency had become such a problem that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> might become a nation of freeloaders. On Tuesday, he said things have improved and the `` first fruits'' of his rectification campaign are being seen. But he also called for more hard work and fewer illusions and told those yearning for an industrialized nation, where the work day is eight hours or less, that they are dreaming. `` It's necessary to work and work hard,'' he said. `` We do n't impose anything on the We persuade the worker.'' The rectification campaign has moved away from economic incentives toward the kind of moral exhortation employed in the early days of the revolution. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also made it clear that he is n't going to launch any reform campaigns like those of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will never adopt methods, styles, philosophies or idiosyncracies of capitalism,'' he said. Capitalist systems, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, are `` complete garbage. They're not good for anything.'' He also said there will be no move away from one-party rule. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> wore his standard green uniform and cap. Although his famous beard is turning white, he spoke with as much vigor and animation as ever. But his image was still a sharp contrast to the pictures of the young revolutionary and his comrades preparing for the July 26, 1958, attack on the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> garrison. The attack failed. But five years and five months later, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> marched triumphantly into <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A long-time political activist said Wednesday he has been the target of three break-ins in as many weeks and believes they were politically motivated. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who has been active in the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said the break-ins occurred this month at his home, former office and current office. He and a spokeswoman for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> group that defends the civil rights of activists said the break-ins fit the pattern of more than 100 similar burglaries at homes and offices of activists and journalists around the country and abroad. In all three break-ins, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said, a crowbar or other flat instrument was used to pry open a door, `` papers were shuffled around'' and nothing of value was stolen. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said he suspected the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was involved, but <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't think there have been any break-ins involving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. ... I have no statement regarding the allegations of this person in <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.'' `` We're now monitoring more than 120 break-ins around the country of this type,'' said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. She said that the motives for the break-ins _ in which nothing was stolen but files were rifled _ appeared to intelligence gathering, harassment and intimidation. <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had launched its own investigation into allegations of politically motivated break-ins but determined that jurisdiction for the burglaries rested with state and local police. <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he, too, initially thought the break-ins were politically motivated, but that other recent break-ins with similar modes of operation had since led him to believe otherwise. He said it was unusual for break-ins to occur without anything being stolen, but that it had happened on at least two other instances in the city recently. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s allegation came the same day <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported that confidential CBS News memos stolen from the home of a reporter based in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> had turned up in files released by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in response to a subpoena. Free-lance reporter <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> told the lobe that his home was broken into in 1985 and about a year later, during a time when he was investigating on assignment from CBS an assassination attempt against a dissident Contra leader. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said the documents indicate that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` could have been getting the fruits of political burglaries and break-ins.'' A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the bureau had no comment on how the reporter's documents ended up in its possession.

<HEAD>Administration Showing Less Flexibility On Hostage Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Still nursing scars from the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials are publicly imposing ground rules which seemingly limit flexibility to win the liberation of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> say no deals will be negotiated with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will discuss the hostage situation only with `` authoritative'' representatives of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government. Neither of these limitations was placed on the jockeying in 1985-86 that led to the clandestine sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the diversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels and the subsequent indictment of two onetime White House officials. However, two American hostages _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> _ were released during that mercurial period. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> subsequently argued that he was merely seeking an opening to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, not an arms-for-hostages trade, when he approved the transfer of <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. A presidential panel disagreed with him, and so did a joint congressional investigative committee. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> eventually acknowledged that what had started out as an overture to moderate political elements in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had turned into what the public perceived as an arms-for-hostages swap. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance last week of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution imposing a cease-fire in the long war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has raised expectations of an improved climate for getting the hostages out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. When asked Monday if the time was ripe to try once again to talk to the Iranians about the hostages, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the Iranian officials: `` If they're ready and willing to talk, it's time.'' But administration officials followed that broad-brush remark with a series of statements stressing limitations on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on this subject. They said the administration would not again fall prey to something that can be construed as bargaining with a terrorist nation for the release of hostages. So, the guidance that administration officials gave out for public consumption was that they would not go to any length to get the hostages out. But the administration previously had denied certain aspects of the 1985-86 initiative, and was proved wrong. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for instance, sent an amended statement to the Tower review board about how the initial missile shipments had been approved by him. While steadfastly insisting that officials are doing all they can to learn the whereabouts of the nine Americans and get them out, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sought Wednesday to minimize the significance of statements from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suggesting a new interest in the issue. In so doing, he set forth another ground rule limiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic flexibility: an insistence that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government have direct communication from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> or an authoritative source speaking for the government of revolutionary leader, the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. If <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants to talk to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the spokesman said, its leaders must back up statements in speeches with `` authoritative communications'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> left no doubt that the uproar over earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings on hostages has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials more wary _ and even cautious _ than before. `` One of the lessons we learned from that experience -LRB- Iran-Contra -RRB- is that it's very difficult to have those kinds of discussions without them becoming arms for hostages or ransom for hostages or negotiations for hostages,'' the spokesman said. `` And that's why we're not going to do it again.'' As if to prove his point, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> scoffed at statements by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, <PERSON> Hojatolislam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, indicating an interest in warming relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and suggesting a willingness to deal on the hostages. `` We frankly do n't know what they're trying to say,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It their pattern to make these kinds of claims and hope somebody bites, and you will recall we went through this a year ago.'' `` My scars are deep enough, I do not forget those conversations,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who bore the brunt of reporters' questions after the Iran-Contra affair was exposed in November 1986 The release of 52 American hostages from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in early 1981 was brought about, at least in part, by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deal to turn over to an international tribunal at least $ 3 billion in frozen Iranian assets. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an executive order seeking to enforce the assets agreement that then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, although officials of the new administration said they would not have signed such an agreement. Asked Wednesday if the administration was ruling out just such an arrangement, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't link assets to hostages, and no deals.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, said freeing the nine hostages was not subject to bartering with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over frozen assets. `` This is a proposal that has been surfaced and resurfaced many times over the past two years, and each time we have noted that there can be no connection between the hostages and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claim in -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- The Hague,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> bristled when asked whether the hostages had become `` the forgotten men.'' `` No, we've been talking about them every day for a week,'' he said, referring to his give-and-take with reporters during White House news briefings.

<HEAD>Fourteen More Deaths From Disease in Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An epidemic of cholera and gastroenteritis killed 14 more people in the capital on Wednesday and raised the nationwide death toll to 445, hospital officials and news reports said. An opposition leader called for Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to resign and said he `` had failed to provide an effective administration in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>.'' L.K. <PERSON> Advani </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was addressing a protest march by relatives of disease victims in the capital. Since the beginning of the month, 171 people have died in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> alone from the diseases, news reports said. A health official in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said 14 people died in hospitals on Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said more than 12,800 cases of the two diseases had been reported in the nation. The outbreak followed heavy rains in the past month that reportedly contaminated drinking water. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, city officials blame the outbreak of the diseases on the contamination of wells by overflowing sewers. They also blame the contamination on rainfall washing through uncollected garbage. Garbage in several slums on the eastern edge of the city was not collected for more than three months because of a disagreement between two city agencies. In Parliament, Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the government would take action against those found responsible for the epidemic. In addition to causing disease, the rains from the annual monsoons have resulted in more than 300 deaths from drowning, mudslides or collapses of huts. Thirty-one more deaths were reported Wednesday, including 19 killed in the past several days in flash floods near <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. Other victims included three children crushed to death when a wall of their house collapsed in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state; seven people reported drowned in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state; and two swept away in the <LOCATION> Ravi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, news agencies said.

 Police said Wednesday they arrested an American wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in connection with an Asia-based drug ring that authorities have called the biggest ever uncovered. The 42-year-old man was arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, a police statement said. <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> police refused to release the American's name.

 <PERSON> Fazlur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and one of the nation's leading experts on the Moslem faith, has died of complications related to heart surgery. He was 68. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, had been the <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> Distinguished Service Professor in the school's Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations department since 1969. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, who died Tuesday, was world-renowned for his modern interpretation of Moslem law. He proposed that the Koran gave broad moral prescriptions that should be adapted as social conditions change rather than used as the basis for a rigid and unchanging system. Those views were called radical by Islamic fundamentalists who believe in a strict interpretation of the Koran. He left his homeland of what is now <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the late 1940s, and found great success in spreading his philosophy at several universities.

<HEAD>Rescuers Raise Fishing Boat, Recover 20 Bodies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rescue workers Wednesday recovered 20 bodies when they raised the wreckage of a fishing boat that sank after colliding with a <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> submarine last week at the entrance to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> harbor. That brought the confirmed death toll from Saturday's accident to 29, a coast guard official said. Still missing was a 24-year-old woman, <PERSON> Mami </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhara </PERSON>. Forty-eight people were on board the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru to fishing boat when it collided with the submarine, which was cruising on the surface of the water across the busy shipping lane. The vessel sank in less than two minutes and 19 people were rescued. No injuries were reported among the 75 men on board the submarine, which was almost undamaged. The salvage team, using a massive crane, winched the boat to the surface from a depth of about 160 feet. The coard guard official said a long, narrow hole under the bow of the ship indicated the impact from the submarine, which probably lifted up the front of the boat and caused it to sink stern-first. Survivors and newspapers have charged that the submarine's crew members stood by watching on the deck as victims sank out of sight in the water. `` I saw the men on the submarine, so I called out, ` Why do n't you help?' one survivor told reporters. `` But even though there were more than 10 of them watching, they did n't do anything,'' she said. The submarine picked up only three survivors. News reports Wednesday said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> has offered to resign over the accident but would stay on until an investigation was completed. News reports have suggested the submarine, the 2,200-ton Nadashio, may have erred in continuing on its course after sighting the fishing boat before the collision. But news reports quoted the fishing boat's surviving crew as saying the <PERSON> Nadashio </PERSON>, on the left, blasted its horn to warn the boat of its approach. Adm. <PERSON> Shuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON>, navy chief of staff, said Wednesday he believed the submarine's crew had taken proper measures to avoid the accident. Defense officials have said the collision was the worst between Japanese navy and civilian vessels since World War II.

 Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> and gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> can remain on this November's ballot despite discrepancies in their filing papers, the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday. The discrepancies between the candidates' declarations of candidacy and their voter registration cards included a missing middle initial in a signature and a street that was listed as an avenue. Opponents had challenged the candidacies of <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, saying they violated a state law requiring declarations of candidacy and voter registration cards to match exactly. But the elections board said the discrepancies were n't important enough to disqualify the candidates. Board chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiStefano </PERSON> said after Wednesday's hearing that the board would ask the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to amend the law next year to allow minor variations in signatures The current statute, which has been in effect since 1950, may be more exacting than needed to prevent fraud, he said. `` The question is, is it overkill?'' <PERSON> DiStefano </PERSON> said. `` Could we have had a less stringent requirement to accommodate the given purpose? I think so.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a Republican, was accused of signing her declaration with her initial, but leaving it off her voter registration card. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> also listed her address on the form as Central Avenue instead of Central Street. She argued that she made the same signature error on her 1986 candidacy papers, and that was not challenged by the board at the time. As for <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s address, the board said, `` This board has interpreted the statute in its prior rulings so as to permit some variation in the address so long as there no substantial variance.'' <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor, signed his declaration with his initials, but his registration card spells out his first name, and included the word `` street,'' which was omitted from his address on his registration. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> said he signed both forms with his initials, but someone added `` ruce'' to his first name on the registration card without his knowledge later. `` Mr. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> is not chargeable with knowledge of or responsibility for an unauthorized alteration of his signature on the voter registration card,'' the board ruled. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>'s bid for a third term was been challenged by an independent opponent because the senator listed his house number on the form declaring his candidacy, while his voter registration card left out the number. The Republican senator told the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> that when he bought his house in <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION> in 1961, the homes there had not yet been numbered. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> said that if he is elected, he would seek to make the law governing candidacy declarations less stringent. `` I do n't think any candidate should have to go through this,'' he said.

 Golfers at the <ORGANIZATION> Waterville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> are experiencing a new barrier between them and that perfect game: foxes that steal their golf balls and stash them in sand-trap hideaways. During one recent tournament, the fleet-footed critters swiped the golf balls of all three players on one team and forced the players to drop out of competition, pro-shop employee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It's a very common occurrence to have them -LRB- the foxes -RRB- stand five or six feet away,'' said <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON>, who plays the 18-hole course frequently.

<HEAD>Official Warns Against Overreacton To Pentagon Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congress and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should n't overreact to the current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bribery investigation by passing a lot of new laws and regulations, the head of a commission that reviewed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> business practices said Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` investigators must do everything possible to identify the real criminals and bring them to justice and try to do so in ways that will help to deter such action in the future,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But Packard, who headed a presidential commission that in 1986 recommended changes in the way the Pentagon purchases weapons and other items, warned that `` I believe it is very important not to overreact to these recently disclosed allegations.'' `` This country has long-established legal procedures to deal with crime,'' he said. `` They should not be pre-empted in the name of military reform. To do so results in actions of a kind that would be expected only in the most tyrannical type of a police state.'' `` Such actions are the antithesis of the very fundamental concepts of a free society and a free enterprise economy,'' he said. `` It is very hard for me to understand how this came about during an administration dedicated to free enterprise.'' Packard is chairman of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> and is a former deputy secretary of defense. His testimony was his first major comment on the current bribery case, which involves allegations that defense contractors and private consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employes for inside information about future contracts. No one has yet been charged. Criminal activity is a problem that should be handled by professional investigators, <PERSON> Packard </PERSON> said, but losses to criminals `` are not large in comparison with the waste and inefficiences in the major acquisition programs.'' There are four major reasons for that waste and inefficiency, he said, including lack of a `` world-wide military strategy,'' pressure on each of the four services to promote their own weapons, annual congressional appropriations instead of multi-year spending, and congressional spending for weapons and bases `` that are not needed.'' He said there have `` been many positive steps in the right direction'' in implementing the changes proposed by his commission. But he added that the breakdown of the procurement system is caused by congressional attempts to impose competition among defense contractors where it is `` virtually impossible to achieve'' or with regulations enforced `` by what I consider to be identical to ` police state' tactics.'' In the private sector, he said, `` price is seldom, if ever, the only factor in purchasing a product or awarding a contract. The quality of the product is almost always more important and the support and service the supplier can provide are also more important than price alone.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, a figure in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement investigation, violated the ethics code by dealing with his former employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> last October for a briefing on the latest version of the P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition management, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> executive who agreed after joining the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to disqualify himself from any dealings with his former employer. `` We do n't know the extent of his involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in that trip,'' said <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>. `` We have referred it to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> which is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> of investigation on the case. It was not whether anyone had approved <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' trip to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is one of six <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who were moved to other duties after <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it was investigating allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed defense officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. In the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> department, <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> was a deputy to <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, the assistant secretary for research, engineering and systems. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had worked at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> for 28 years before he was recruited by the then <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> in 1981. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 to become a consultant, recruited <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, with whom he had worked at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970's. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said his office had referred the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> last week, `` bringing to their attention the disqualifier in his financial disclosure form that he is prohibited from dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Our feeling was that an investigation was needed to determine whether <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> had violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> code 208, which governs ethics cases,'' said <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' financial disclosure form, released through the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would pay him a lifetime pension his service with the company, which ended Sept. 30, 1985, and would include him in its major medical plan until he turned 65. Because of <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' continuing financial relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, through the pension and health insurance plans, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials sent him a letter on Sept. 19, 1986, saying that `` you are hereby disqualified from taking any action in connection with matters involving these firms -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates -RRB-, or any subsidiary or affiliates of these firms.'' `` Such actions include, but are not limited to, participation in program reviews, approval of funding actions, review of Acquisition Plans and Justifications and Approvals,'' said the letter, which was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON>, principal deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, Engineering and Systems. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the agency would have no comment and referred all questions to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> says it is investigating botched operations that have killed 17 civilians recently and damaged its image in the guerrilla campaign to drive the British from this troubled province. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> prides itself on attacking only security forces, sparing civilians, but even some staunch supporters have criticized the blunders. One is <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. After a bomb exploded outside a public swimming pool in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> earlier this month, killing two of his <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> constituents, he said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> must `` get its house in order.'' Four recent bombings have been bungled, beginning with one that killed 11 Protestant men, women and children in November at a memorial service for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s war dead at <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION>. The attack inspired international condemnation of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statements said the bomb was radio-controlled to explode as soldiers marched by but British electronic scanners may have detonated it prematurely. OnSaturday, a misdirected bomb killed a Protestant family of three returning from a vacation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At first the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said they were `` victims of mistaken identity,'' then claimed the 1,000-pound bomb was detonated by British army scanning equipment. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said High Court Judge <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was the intended target. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and his family drove home from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vacation at about the same time. In other admitted blunders, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men shot and killed a 21-year-old Protestant woman in March, then said her brother was the intended target. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the brother belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, but he was found to have no connection with the security forces of the Protestant-dominated province. Its operatives planted a bomb on a schoolbus last month intending to kill the driver, a part-time member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. A dozen Protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> teen-agers were wounded, one seriously. Police superintendent <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in an interview: `` People who set out to kill other people have to accept the consequences of their acts. I do n't accept the word accident or mistake. These people are criminal thugs waging war on the population.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremist group, claimed responsibility Tuesday for killing <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 33, shot at his home the previous day by three men who reportedly wore police uniforms. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> accused police of collusion with the killers, saying a police patrol passed outside <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s home shortly before he was killed. <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> says the religion of most victims indicates the overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> targets Protestants. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> is sensitive to the charge of sectarianism and denies such a motive. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said every blunder `` is very, very serious and tragic'' and the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> cancels more operations than it conducts for fear of civilian casualties. `` If you take the amount of operations the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> have successfully carried out over the last 18 years and put it beside the list of mistakes ... they're very minimal,'' he said in an interview. He added, however, that a `` very serious inquiry'' into civilian deaths is under way because `` no one realizes more than the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> that bad operations can damage them.'' <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was examining whether remote-controlled devices have been tampered with, and possible carelessness by its operatives. Theories abound on why the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is missing targets. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said self-protection measures by security forces make attackers run more risks. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a moderate <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> group, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is using the `` dregs of the organization'' as operatives. `` It seems to me that they are not getting the young people of ability that they did in the past, and because of that their expertise simply does not exist,'' he said on Radio Ulster. <PERSON> Eamonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallie </PERSON>, a journalists and co-author of a book about the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, says there is a split within the organization but <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> denied it. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> have never been as united as what they are now,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved $ 15 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments after calling on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to reassess <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> does not stop selling missiles in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The bill, which was approved 80-16, was the 11th appropriations bill the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has passed this year. The measure now goes to conference with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which passed its own version of the measure last month, pegged to a far lower $ 7 billion spending level. The measure includes $ 7.5 million to establish a U.S.-based television station to broadcast news, information and entertainment to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The station, to be known as Television <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, would be a follow-on to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in operation since 1983. The proposal was sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who said Television <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> would `` send the message of democracy to everyone in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Study Says Cutting Defense Budget Further Could Affect Readiness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The next administration will have a difficult time reducing the defense budget because much of the budget goes for personnel and affects the nation's military preparedness, a study released Wednesday warned. The current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget is about $ 300 billion a year and has doubled during the eight years of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. A total of 55 percent of the budget is spent for a category known as `` operation and support -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S -RRB-'' which covers pay for the nation's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel and a variety of other daily expenses, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has approved a series of pay increases for the troops, a move hailed by <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> alike as having improved the quality of military recruits. But after five years of large annual increases in defense spending, the Pentagon budget has been frozen the past three years and both <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic leaders have predicted that no major defense budget increases are likely in the near future. Aside from reducing spending on personnel, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could cut future spending by reducing the number of new weapons it buys. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> earlier this year announced layoffs among the civilian <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> workforce as part of the effort to meet lower-than-forecast defense budgets. As the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` modifies its budget to conform with likely fiscal realities, some further reduction in the number of forces could occur,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> study said. `` These reductions would adversely affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military capability ... `` Decreases in <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S spending could be serious because they are associated with military readiness, which is defined as the ability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to fight well early in a war,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Readiness is considered crucial by many military analysts, since it determines how well active forces could respond to surprise attacks, and how rapidly reserve forces would be available to augment them,'' it said. `` It is enhanced if forces are fully equipped, manned, and trained in peactime and operations spending influences manning and training.''

<HEAD>Beach Remains Closed After Rats Wash Ashore</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now decomposed rats have washed ashore on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> beaches, joining medical waste in a bounty of unwanted debris that has closed many East Coast recreation areas this summer. Altogether, 10 of the 14.3 miles of beaches administered by the city <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were closed because of debris Wednesday. In addition, most of the beaches in the <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> remained closed. `` It's very disappointing to us,'' said Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who added that he hoped investigators would find who was responsible for the illegal dumping `` and send them away for a long time.'' While officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said they were baffled by the seaborne invasion of debris, authorities in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> said they had traced medical waste that washed ashore in that state to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> hospitals, drug stores and ambulances. Nine rats were among the 246 pieces of waste that were found at <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>. At least 24 more pieces of debris were found Wednesday. Most of the items were syringes, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which ordinarily attracts hundreds of thousands of bathers on hot summer days, remained closed. Health Department officials initially thought the rats had been used in laboratories because they appeared to have been systematically shaved, but <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said investigators later determined the rodents' hair had fallen out in clumps due to decomposition. `` There is no evidence that they are laboratory rats,'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. On <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials reported the discovery of what appeared to be infectious medical waste at the town of <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>'s oceanside transfer station. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Feuer </PERSON> <PERSON> Domash </PERSON> said the waste had been traced to the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>. However, a spokesman for the hospital said all the material had undergone a high-temperature sterilizing procedure and was allowed at the transfer station. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, officials have found at least 60 items in recent weeks, including needles and syringes, catheter bags, rubber tubing, a colostomy bag and respirator parts. Waste continued to wash ashore on Wednesday. `` Everything that we're picking up is coming back to the same geographic source,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiOrio </PERSON>, policy director for Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>. `` All of the evidence coming in at this point points to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> general area.'' A 9-inch-long sign, inscribed `` NYCEMS,'' washed ashore last Thursday in <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stobierski </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Officials believe the sign stands for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which provides ambulance services for that city's health and hospitals division, <PERSON> DiOrio </PERSON> said `` The sign has washed up, but that does n't explain how it got into the water,'' said <PERSON> Stobierski </PERSON>. `` We do n't even have signs that say NYCEMS,'' Lt. <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertland </PERSON>, of the medical service, said Wednesday. She said she could not comment further without seeing the sign.

<HEAD>NASA Poorly Prepared To Predict Weather For Space Launches, Panel
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> study released Wednesday said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs to build a system to more accurately predict weather conditions at the moment spacecraft are launched from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The study, which analyzed the system used by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to protect its spacecraft from lightning and other adverse weather, said that major improvements are needed in organization and in instruments. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the panel said, `` has been poorly organized to provide weather support and the result is a system that is less than state-of-the-science,'' the report said. It noted that unless improvements in the weather forecasting system are made at the Kennedy center, `` weather will loom larger as a threat to a rejuvenated and accelerated space flight program.'' The study said that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> must have a system that can accurately forecast weather and lightning conditions that are valid for at least two hours. `` Observations of lightning, electric fields aloft ... and rapid wind variations are most urgently needed,'' the report said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s weather support office, said the space agency asked for the study and is now studying the results. `` We've taken some initial steps and the recommendations confirm that the steps we've taken are the right thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON>. `` We've got a better handle on the problem now.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> recommended these actions: _ Equipping an aircraft with instruments to measure electric fields aloft and to gauge wind velocity and turbulance in the path of a spacecraft to be launched or landed _ Installation of an instrument that will detect sudden wind changes _ Installation of additional instruments to monitor the approach of major thunderstorm systems <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> managers were criticized in the study for not defining the precise minimum weather conditions for a space shuttle launch. `` The weather support system has not been able to concentrate sufficiently on the special problems of the space shuttle,'' the report said. `` Some critical parameters are currently not measured _ such as drop sizes in clouds and rain, which are hazardous because of the possibility of protective tile damage _ and there is no program to initiate these types of measurements,'' the report said. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> said that the agency is planning to put special weather instruments aboard an airplane that will cruise near the space center during a space launch countdown. He said the airplane will be equipped to measure the potential for lightning in clouds up to 45,000 feet. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> also is installing instruments on a buoy anchored in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> east of the launch pad. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> said this should give more information on approaching thunderstorms. Additionally, he said, the space agency is planning to install a radar which will warn of wind shear turbulence. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> requested the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> study when lightning caused the destruction of an Atlas-Centaur rocket after it was launched from the Kennedy Space Center. Later studies showed the rocket was hit by four strokes of lightning 48 seconds after liftoff. The electrical discharge disrupted an on-board computer memory system and the vehicle went out of control. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> destroyed the rocket to protect property and people downrange, using a signal from the ground. At the time of the Atlas-Centaur destruction, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> panel said, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> were operating one of the largest networks of electrical field measurements in the world. Yet, the report said, these measurements had not been entered into the system that committed to launch. Rockets, as they rise from the launch pad and streak toward space, are able to trigger lightning if they penetrate clouds that contain high charges of electricity. The tail of hot gases streaming from the rockets can actually form a conduction path for the lightning charge to flow to the ground. Triggered lightning has hit only one piloted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spacecraft. Apollo 12 was struck twice by lightning as it was launched on Nov. 14, 1969. The electrical charge temporarily disrupted communications and permanently damaged nine non-essential circuits, but the spacecraft and its astronauts successfully completed the second manned landing on the moon. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is the principal operating arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to develop advanced rocket systems if the nation plans to launch the Star Wars defense system or to send people to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> someday, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said in a study released Wednesday. OTA, a research agency that serves <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, issued what it called a `` buyers' guide'' outlining the options <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could consider if it decides to go shopping for new rocket systems. To continue the nation's space program at about the rate of the era before the Challenger accident, the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said the `` best buy'' would be to improve the space shuttle and the existing fleet of expendable rockets _ Titan, Atlas-Centaur and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. `` This approach would have little technical risk and would require a small investment,'' the report said. To achieve an increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> launches by about 5 percent a year, the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> suggested four options: increased production and more launch sites for the current rockets; modification of current rockets so they can carry more cargo; development of a cargo ship, called Shuttle-C, based on space shuttle technology; or construction of a new rocket based on current technology. The agency said that if the nation decides to deploy <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, or to send people to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> it will need to invest in new rocket technology to reduce cost, increase performance and provide flexibility. It said such new technology could be developed three ways: an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposal to build an advanced, expendable rocket; a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> proposal to build a new generation of space shuttle, called the Shuttle II; or development of a National Aerospace Plane, a hypersonic aircraft capable of taking off from a runway and flying into orbit. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> advanced launch rocket would be the cheapest, least technically challenging and could be ready by the end of this century. The other two would take longer and cost more, but a Shuttle II would preserve the nation's ability to send humans into orbit, the study said. The report said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has, or can develop, the technology for any of the options, but `` it lacks the resources to pursue them all simultaneously'' and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to make a choice.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Test-Firing Delayed Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A vital test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines has been delayed again, until Monday, because of a faulty fuel valve and other problems, the space agency announced Wednesday. The troubles halted a practice countdown during which the spaceship's external fuel tank was to have been loaded Wednesday night, the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986. Officials said the count was held up several hours by the need to replace a fuel valve. Other technical problems also contributed to the delay. The flight readiness firing of the three engines had been set for Saturday, but earlier this week was put off until Sunday to give technicians more time to close out the engine compartment. Under the new schedule, the fuel tank now will be loaded with half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen on Thursday night and the countdown will be taken down to 10 seconds before a mock liftoff. At that point, a simulated problem will force a `` launch'' delay. Engineers then will rehearse what is called a 72-hour launch turnaround. They will drain the fuel from the tank and start another countdown, aiming for a firing of the engines at 7:30 a.m. Monday. The 20-second firing will test several modifications made to the engines and is essential to certifying Discovery for the first post-Challenger shuttle launch. Elsewhere, engineers seemed to be favoring cutting a hole in Discovery's rear cargo bay wall as the best approach to repair a small gas leak without having to take the shuttle off the launch pad. Moving the shuttle could delay the planned early September launch by as much as two months. Cutting the hole would enable experts to reach the otherwise-inaccessible leak, which is in a fitting on a line leading to an oxidizer tank in an engine compartment. They could either tighten the fitting or enclose the leak with a clamshell device filled with an epoxy sealant. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate this approach would take 10 days to two weeks. Engineers still are testing a method in which a device resembling a badminton shuttlecock would be pushed into the 27-foot-long vent line trailing a sealing agent. No decision is expected until after the main engine firing on whether to try to fix the leak on the pad or to roll Discovery back to a hangar for repair. Even if the leak can be repaired don the pad, officials expect the launch to slip past mid-September. The leak is in a steering engine system, separate from the main engines which are to be test-fired.

<TEXT>
 Too much rain has slowed this summer's grain harvest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` Rains accompanied by strong winds reportedly have caused lodging -LRB- tangling -RRB-, impeding the early grain harvest in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> this year,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Despite the unfavorable conditions, some areas are reporting excellent winter grain yields.'' As of July 18, grain and pulses, which include peas and beans, had been cut on 14.9 million hectares, of which 9.8 million had been threshed, the report said. That was below the four-year average of 23.5 million hectares cut and 18.6 million harvested by this time between 1983 and 1986. Even so, harvest progress is ahead of the year-ago pace when the season was late and only 8.9 million hectares were cut and 5.4 million harvested by now, the report said. In all, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has around 116 million hectares for harvest this year. One hectare is equal to about 2.47 acres. The 1987 Soviet grain harvest went on to produce an estimated 211.4 million metric tons, and this year's has been forecast by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> at 215 million tons, one of the largest on record. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.

 The TV ministry formerly run by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has dropped the name <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to dissociate itself from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankrupt commercial operations. The network ministry show formerly called `` PTL Today'' went on the air without a name Tuesday morning, and viewers were asked to send donations to a new entity called <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, not PTL. `` The address is the same, but for the first time you can write ` Heritage Ministries' on your checks,'' <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> Pastor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Tuesday in a guest appearance on the show. Heritage Ministries must operate independently of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial operations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park, beginning Monday, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Trustee M.C `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> is trying to sell those properties to settle its debts. `` <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> is on its own next week,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. `` They've been learning to stand and now they have to go on their own legs.'' The television show sported a new look Tuesday. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> appeared on a set featuring leather furniture and a study with a bookcase backdrop. He said the set cost less than $ 900. The old set was larger, had more furniture, and gave the appearnace of a large, informal family room. `` We're starting brand new,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have any money or any debts.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Procurement Probe Prompts Delaying Announcement Of
Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, displaying extreme sensitivity in the wake of the defense procurement investigation, delayed for one day the announcement of a routine contract with the parent company of a firm suspended in the case, sources said Wednesday. `` We pulled it for a day to get ready for questions we expected in response to the announcement,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Under the $ 3.5 million deal, announced Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was to repair or replace electronic tubes for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Close-In Weapons System of the Phalanx anti-missile gun. The deal was scheduled for release on Tuesday, but the announcement was delayed, said three <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources. `` We wanted to make sure that the company was not on the list,'' said one Pentagon official. A Varian affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, has been suspended from doing business with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> because it was implicated in the defense procurement investigation. And <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> suspended <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the company vice president for marketing. Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have seen no evidence implicating the parent company in the investigation. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, described the contract as routine.

 Deposed <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> may have faked reports about carloads of gunmen to divert attention from reports that he offered $ 5 billion for permission to return home, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> consul said Wednesday. `` Frankly, this is another one of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' imbecilities,'' said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> consul general here. `` Every time <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> finds himself in thick soup, he does something bizarre.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, spent Tuesday night at a friend's home following a report that guards saw guns sticking out the windows of three cars driving by their home, according to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> The Marcoses returned home Wednesday and `` feel it's a little bit safer,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. The <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> household had been warned of a plot to kill <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> before the cars drove past, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said Wednesday he did n't know anything about the report and did n't want to comment `` because one of the world's master illusionists is at work.'' The report of gunmen came on the same day that a published report said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had offered to pay the Philippine government $ 5 billion in exchange for being allowed to return to his homeland free from criminal prosecution. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> admitted negotiations are in progress but said money was not involved. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who keeps tabs on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government, said he believed the alleged threat was a ploy to draw attention from the published report. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' guards, who were on foot, chased the cars but could not get a description because it was early in the morning and still dark. No shots were fired and no one was injured, he said. A <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> police dispatcher said the incident was not reported. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said the Marcoses were awakened shortly after the cars drove by and driven to the friend's home. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since his ouster in a civilian-military revolt in February 1986 that brought President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his family and associates are alleged to have stolen up to $ 10 billion from the Philippine treasury during his 20-year rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In January 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities barred <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife from leaving <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> following a coup attempt in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> by his followers.

<HEAD>Republicans File Suit to Block Release of Democratic Campaign
Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republicans filed suit Wednesday to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from releasing $ 46 million in public campaign funds to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his Democratic running mate Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also asked the court to issue an injunction to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from acting on Tuesday's decision by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> that cleared the way for the Dukakis-Bentsen team to get the public funds allowed general election presidential contenders. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is also seeking re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We asked the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from acting on the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> certification of the funds for Dukakis-Bentsen until the court hears our case,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, legal counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> NRSC </ORGANIZATION>. The Republicans contend <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s situation violates federal election law and gives the Democratic presidential ticket an unfair financial advantage. An unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law allows <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to run for re-election as senator and seek the vice presidency at the same time. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race is funded with private contributions. But federal law forbids private funds in the presidential general election race, since each party nominee receives $ 46 million from the $ 1 voluntary income tax checkoff fund. In the suit, the <ORGANIZATION> NRSC </ORGANIZATION> charged that the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> acted in an `` arbitrary and capricious manner'' in its 6-0 vote on Tuesday rejecting the group's petition seeking to block release of the public funds for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` We do n't want to hold up Dukakis-Bentsen getting $ 46 million,'' <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> said. `` We want to stop Dukakis-Bentsen from getting $ 46 million-plus from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Re-Election -RRB- Committee.'' In its complaint, the <ORGANIZATION> NRSC </ORGANIZATION> cited examples of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s use of private funds for the general election campaign, including a telegram sent by his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election committee asking for support for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. The group also told the court it would be able to argue the case on Monday, which falls within the 10-day period the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> had to decide on the petition.

 Federal regulators have opened a safety investigation into alleged frame-cracking on more than 1.3 million Chevrolet Camaro and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Firebird cars, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The agency began its preliminary evaluation after receiving three unconfirmed reports of cracks in the front of the cars' frames <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said the cracks allegedly could cause the cars to go out of control. The investigation, involving 1,302,736 cars from 1982-1985 model years, is the lowest level of defect probe conducted by the agency. `` We are cooperating fully with them,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Noack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We do point out that just because there is the allegation of a defect does not mean a defect exists.'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also ended an engineering analysis of alleged excessive exhaust heat in 331,207 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> 20 and 30 series full-size pickup trucks and vans, concluding there was insufficient evidence to show any safety defect existed. The agency had opened the investigation after receiving unconfirmed reports of 18 accidents. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also opened preliminary evaluations into these vehicles: _ 1987 Toyota Corolla: Two complaints alleged faulty wiring in rear window defoggers tends to cause back-seat fires The investigation involves 170,000 cars. _ 1986-1987 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Legend and Accord: Four unconfirmed complaints said inadequate fuel-system ventilation results in excessive pressure in the fuel tank, leading to leakage and vapor release when the gas cap is removed The investigation involves 350,000 cars. _ 1988 Ford <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> VII: Three complaints alleged the power seat on the driver's side tends to move suddenly, startling the driver and potentially causing a loss of control The probe involves 30,000 cars. _ 1988 Chrysler Medallion: Seven complaints alleged the cars stall intermittently because of a wiring problem <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> was unable to say how many cars were involved in the investigation. _ 1984-1985 Chrysler Voyager: Six complaints alleged a front coil spring tends to break, puncturing the front tire and causing the possibility of a loss of control at high speeds The investigation involves 182,000 vehicles.

<HEAD>EPA Warns of Fines Against Non-Complying Sewage Treatment Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cities and towns still not in compliance with federal sewage treatment requirements or on their way to compliance should expect to pay fines, the government warned Wednesday. Eighty-six percent of the nation's sewage treatment plants handling 95 percent of the nation's sewage flow met the July 1 deadline for subjecting their discharge to so-called `` secondary'' treatment _ treatment with bacteria to remove about 90 percent of ordinary pollution, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We think it is a success story ... largely attributable to state agencies and municipalities,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference with <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazrullah </PERSON>, assistant attorney general for land and natural resources. `` We still have major water quality problems'' from other sources, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` The resolution behind this effort is exactly the resolution required to deal with the remaining issues.'' Of the 2,095 non-complying treatment plants, more than two-thirds are the subject of administrative or court settlements containing compliance deadlines and setting out automatic penalties for failure to meet them. The laggards are in every state but <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. All plants in those states use secondary treatment. The worst states were <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, 36 percent of plants complying; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 54 percent; and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 68 percent. It's the 629 remaining non-complying plants, a little over 4 percent of the overall total of 15,486, that were the subject of the warning from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marzullah </PERSON>. `` They should assume there probably will be a penalty,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has won $ 7 million in penalties since 1984 and another $ 5 million was ordered by courts to be spent by local authorities on environmental projects in lieu of fines. The maximum penalty is $ 25,000 a day Of the 629 plants, 409 have been referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or state attorneys general for action. Most of the rest already use secondary treatment and are disputing with EPA how much `` advanced'' treatment is required to remove toxic substances like heavy metals. Asked about the recent discovery of medical waste on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> beaches, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said `` sensitive coastal environments are being overwhelmed by pollution'' and sewage plant discharges were `` a piece of the issue.'' Among major coastal water problems, he singled out `` non-point source'' pollution like fertilizer-laden agricultural runoff `` coming down tributaries into our estuaries'' and combined storm sewer-sanitary sewer outflow in older cities. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he had ordered lawyers to research his authority over hospital waste, but had doubts that he could legally require it to be handled like hazardous waste. Some large non-complying sewage plants have tried to qualify for waivers permitting them to discharge directly into the ocean after `` primary'' filtering and settling treatment removing roughly 40 percent of pollution. Applicants must show they will not degrade local water quality. `` It is a high hurdle to get over,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, and only a quarter are successful. <PERSON> Marzullah </PERSON> said his office and the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> filed a joint suit Wednesday against the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> had won tentative approval for a waiver in 1981, but that approval was reversed in 1986 and the city withdrew its application a year and a half ago. Some communities had gambled on the availability of federal grants, and they could now be out of luck. The roughly $ 2 billion in annual grants is being converted to revolving loan funds in each state, to be completed by 1994. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has distributed $ 42 billion in grants since 1972, when the Clean Water Act originally set a 1977 deadline _ twice extended since then. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> vetoed the 1972 act on the grounds it was too expensive, but was overridden. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> twice vetoed the last renewal, trying to hold the authorization to $ 12 billion through 1994 instead of the $ 18 billion <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed it successfully in 1987.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> heard from two railroads Wednesday that are vying for the purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which is on the auction block because of a failed merger attempt last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.02 billion. But the deal, which requires <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approval, has run into strong opposition from <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which has offered $ 1.25 billion for the 13,000-mile rail system that stretches from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> heard from both railroads Wednesday as it tries to determine which buyer to choose, or whether it might approve both applications and allow <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to choose. A decision is expected next month. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> in formal arguments that the company is in better financial position to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> than is <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City Southern. `` The request -LRB- by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> that it be allowed to buy the railroad -RRB- is unprecedented and unwarranted,'' he said. <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> officials noted that <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> faces a possible $ 600 million settlement from a legal entanglement that grew out of its role in the a failure of a coal slurry pipeline project. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION>, however, maintained before the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> that it would be the most fit buyer of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, arguing that it is offering more money and plans to invest 20 percent more funds in the railroad than the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. `` We are committed to the acquisition and rehabilitation of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. He said the company would invest more than $ 4 billion in the railroad over a five-year period. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of favoring the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> bid because the merger would benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, the other rail line owned by <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, said the company has a binding contract with <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and could not complete the sale this year if the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> were to choose <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> was put up for sale under an <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> divestiture order after the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> last year rejected a planned merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> with the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>.

 The majority of Americans ca n't find <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on the map and have no idea of what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is, according to surveys conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, Americans in the 18-24 age group ranked last when their survey results were compared to similar tests conducted in eight other nations, said the society, which sponsored the international testing. Americans of all age group scored sixth. `` I have a terrible feeling that the American public is not taking education as seriously as they have in the past _ and it's not just geography You are seeing this across the board,'' said society President <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> at a news conference Wednesday. The survey results indicated that three out of four Americans could n't locate the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, most could n't come close to guessing their own nation's population and the majority were lost when it came to finding <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` What was most alarming was not only that young Americans did worse than all other 18 - to 24-year-olds, but that they were the only ones in that age group, among nine countries, who did worse than the oldest group tested,'' <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said `` We're not motivating our kids to take education seriously,'' he said noting recent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> studies ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students well below their foreign counterparts in scientific fields. To combat this, the society has launched a multimillion-dollar public awareness campaign on the problem, he said. The campaign includes the initiation of a National Geography Bee for secondary students, a training program for the nation's 15,000 geography and social studies teachers, and the free distribution of an atlas of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history in 35,000 public, private and parochial schools. Another component involves the development of computer softwear learning tools and a laser disc version of the atlas. The laser disc, scheduled for release in late 1989, is a joint project with <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Films </PERSON>, producers of `` Star Wars.'' The international survey tested 10,820 adults in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Those surveyed were asked to locate 13 selected countries, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on an unmarked world map. Out of a possible score of 16, the Americans ranked sixth with an average of 8.6, on par with the British -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- but significantly better than only the Italians -LRB- 7.6 -RRB- and Mexicans -LRB- 7.4 -RRB-. Top honors went to the Swedes -LRB- 11.6 -RRB- and West Germans -LRB- 11.2 -RRB-, followed by the Japanese -LRB- 9.7 -RRB-, French -LRB- 9.3 -RRB- and Canadians -LRB- 9.2 -RRB-. American youth received a score of 6.9, the lowest mark of all youth tested and all other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> age groups. Overall, 75 percent of Americans placed the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Forty-five percent did not know where <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is located.

<HEAD>False Drug Tests Costs Job, Disrupt Lives, Congress Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Californians testified Wednesday that drug tests which produced erroneous findings cost them their jobs and caused terrible disruptions to their lives. <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee that they were required to take a urinalysis which proved positive, although both said they were not illegal drug users. Each was fired, but got their jobs back after filing a lawsuit against their employers. Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> took a test because her employer, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, required one for all new employees and those who were to be promoted. A data entry operator, she was fired after her drug test showed positive for marijuana. After she filed suit in 1986, it was determined that not only were the results of her tests invalid, but the confirmatory test, which the laboratory claimed it conducted, was, in fact, never done. Her suit was settled out of court. `` I think that drug testing in the workplace is Machiavellian in that the end result does not justify the means,'' Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations. `` Drugs in the workplace or any place else are wrong, but so is drug testing _ and two wrongs have never made a right. `` I do not think that a person's livelihood should depend on a lab test result,'' she said. `` I know that I will never allow myself to be left open to chance again, that if I have to submit to the indignity of giving another urine sample, it will be on my own terms, through my own choice of a lab and my own personal physician.'' There are bills pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> calling for regulation of drug-testing labs. <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON> was fired in 1985 as office manager for the vice president of operations at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after a random urine test showed positive for cocaine. After filing suit and being reinstated at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> as a purchasing manager, his attorney established that the company was unable to find a positive reading for cocaine, seven months after his initial urinalysis, in the confirmation test. `` While I may be an example of what can go wrong with a false positive, my example can not, and should not, be shrugged off as being an exception and not the rule,'' he said. `` One simple, seemingly innocent urine test ruined my career, my life and the health and welfare of my family. `` While drug testing may be seen as a way to cure this country's drug problems, as long as there is the possibility of error in test results and error in human judgment, drug testing in itself is a fallacy,'' <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Researchers Find Clues To Inheritance And Causes Of Asthma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Me. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have taken the first steps toward understanding the causes and the inheritance of asthma with the discovery of two asthma-related genes in laboratory mice. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said Wednesday that learning how these genes work could help doctors identify people at risk for asthma and also could speed the development of better drugs to treat it. So far, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzner </PERSON>, also of <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, have shown that at least two genes can produce a hypersensitivity in the bronchial tubes of mice. The increased sensitivity of the airways to drugs or environmental agents, a phenomenon called increased bronchial reactivity, `` is one of the hallmarks of asthma,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitzner </PERSON> write in the current issue of The <ORGANIZATION> FASEB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> for Experimental Biology. Asthma is estimated to afflict about 6 percent of the population, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, who presented his findings at a genetics course at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, said increased bronchial reactivity can lead both to asthma and to a serious lung disorder called chronic obstructive lung disease, in which patients experience extreme difficulty breathing. The causes of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease are not known, but inherited genetic factors and exposure to agents in the environment both play a role, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. Studies of families in which asthma was inherited showed that even some family members without asthma had inherited an increased bronchial reactivity. `` This seemed to suggest there could be a simple genetic basis for airway hyper-reactivity, asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Mitzner </PERSON> developed machines to monitor breathing in laboratory mice, and they have determined that at least two different genes in mice can lead to this bronchial sensitivity. It is not yet known whether these genes have counterparts in humans, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. One of the genes has been shown to be inherited in mice as a recessive genetic trait, meaning that an offspring would have to inherit the defective gene from both of its parents in order to have bronchial hyper-reactivity. Mice do not develop asthma, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. The inheritance pattern of asthma in humans is not known, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. Further studies of the asthma-related genes in mice should allow researchers to look for similar genes in humans, he said. In order to demonstrate the bronchial hyper-reactivity in the mice, the researchers had to expose the mice to agents thought to be related to the development of asthma in humans. These agents, called serotonin and acetylcholine, are natural substances used by nerve cells to communicate with one another. Some mice were sensitive to one of the agents, some to the other and some to both. Studies of the different mice eventually led <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitzner </PERSON> to conclude that at least two different genes in the mice could contribute to bronchial hyper-reactivity.

 An opposition legislator warned Wednesday that a nuclear-powered Soviet satellite could spread radiation across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when it falls to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> later this year. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, a federal lawmaker in the opposition Social Democrats, said the `` entire <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> lies in the geographical range'' of the falling satellite's path and that the area could be peppered with radioactive debris. <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON> said Soviet officials confirmed the satellite left orbit and was expected to re-enter the atmosphere in September. Western sources have said it could crash in August or earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, has reported that radio contact was lost in April with the Cosmos 1900 satellite, launched Dec. 12, 1987.

<HEAD>House Clamps Down On Timber Harvesting In Alaska Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The environmental lobby scored a long-sought victory Wednesday as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed 361-47 a bill to overhaul the commercial timbering program in the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The measure, sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would scrap the 1980 law that guarantees the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at least $ 40 million a year to support timber sales from the nation's biggest national forest and the continent's last large temperate rain forest. Supporters of the bill like the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> say the guarantee _ unique among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forests _ has not only destroyed ancient trees but handed huge losses to taxpayers, with Tongass sales posting a deficit of $ 254 million from 1982 through 1987. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s lone <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member, Republican <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, argued that the bill repudiates a deal made in 1980 with environmentalists when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put huge portions of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s vast acreage off-limits to development. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that in return for allowing 8.5 million of the forest's 17 million acres to be declared wilderness, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> lawmakers won the spending guarantee and another requiring the forest service to make an average of 450 million board feet of Tongass timber available for sale each year. `` The leisure lobby now wants to go back on its word,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who argued that the guarantees are necessary to preserve some 6,000 timber-related jobs in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` It's a matter of jobs,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` There are people's livelihoods at stake. House supporters of the bill argued that the Tongass region should be looking to tourism and commercial fishing for economic growth. They said over-harvesting the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> hurts both tourism and fisheries. Besides getting rid of the guarantees, the overhaul bill sponsored principally by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Y, would put another 1.7 million Tongass acres off-limits to timber cutting for five Much of the Tongass timber is sold to two large corporations, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Pacific-Ketchikan and the Japanese-owned <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which turn it into pulp, chiefly for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The bill would require the forest service to renegotiate the 50-year contracts it entered into with these firms in the 1950s. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the bill's floor manager, said new contracts are needed to encourage competition in <LOCATION> Tongass </LOCATION> timbering, prevent excessive cutting of old-growth stands and ensure the firms will pay more for <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> trees <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said that a mature <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> spruce from <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> now sells for $ 1.48, compared to $ 2 for a map of the national forest.

<HEAD>Private Investigator Blames Police in Palme Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man conducting a private probe into the unsolved assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> told a hearing Wednesday that authorities knew <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s life may have been in danger, but failed to act. `` If it is not a conspiracy, it is a stupidity so big that I ca n't believe it exists even inside the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in a hearing carried live on national television. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> also made note of wide reports of his homosexuality, saying he had never made a secret of it and that it had nothing to do with his investigation of <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s assassination. Palme, the dominant figure in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s post-World War II politics, was shot in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> on Feb. 28, 1986 as he was leaving a movie theater with his wife. He was unguarded. Police failed to find the killer or establish a motive. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, a publisher and editor, last year organized a secret, unauthorized probe into the killing with financial help from a banker. The investigation led to an uproar when it was revealed in the press, along with reports that <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> subordinates tried to smuggle illegal eavesdropping equipment into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>, who had secretly helped <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, resigned under pressure June 7. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> has said he thought Palme was killed by Kurdish exiles, possibly acting on orders from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. His theory holds that Iranian leaders were angry with Palme because he tried to stop illegal weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said he spoke with the head of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> the day before Palme was killed and was told that police learned from a telephone tap that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> were planning an assassination. `` Neither <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> nor his colleagues got any part of the information that the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> had,'' <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said. The Kurds are an ethnic group seeking a separate state in part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A small group of leftist Kurdish exiles known as the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were mentioned in several reports during the police investigation as perhaps organizing Palme's killing. The Palme government classified the group as a terrorist organization and sentenced two of its purported members to life imprisonment for killing two defectors from the group. Leading police and government officials, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> _ no relation to the publisher _ were also scheduled to testify before the Standing Committee on the Constitution, an independent parliamentary body that acts as a watchdog to insure that the government follows the constitution.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a slightly faster rate than previously believed in 1987 and 1985 although the country did experience one quarter in 1986 when the economy actually contracted, the government said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced those findings as it released updated statistics on the gross national product, the country's total output of goods and services Each year, the government goes back and revises its earlier estimates of GNP growth to take into account additional information. The revisions boosted growth rates in 1987 and 1985 while lowering the growth rate slightly in 1986. The government said it underestimated growth rates in large part because it failed to record all of the consumer spending that occurred in previous years. The largest revision took place in 1987. GNP growth for that year is now estimated at 3.4 percent, up from a previous estimate of 2.9 percent growth. GNP growth in 1985 was revised up to 3.4 percent, compared with an earlier estimate of 3 percent growth. Growth for 1986 was lowered to 2.8 percent instead of the previous 2.9 percent. In addition, the government reported that the economy actually contracted in one quarter in 1986, falling by 0.8 percent in the second quarter, instead of rising by 0.6 percent as previously believed. However, that one-quarter decline was not enough to spell an end to the current recovery from the 1981-82 recession. One of the most commonly used definitions of a recession is two consecutive quarters of declining GNP. The 0.8 percent decline in the GNP from April to June of 1986 was followed by a 1 percent rise in the GNP in the third quarter that year. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said it was not at all unusual to have one or two isolated quarters of declining GNP during long expansions. The current recovery from the 1981-82 recession has lasted a peacetime record of 68 months. `` We have not had a recession,'' <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said, when asked about the decline in the spring of 1986. `` In an expansion, you get one or two isolated down quarters which reflect isolated circumstances.'' Officials said the longest recovery on record, the 106-month expansion from February 1961 to December 1969, which included the Vietnam War buildup, had two negative quarters. The previous record-holder for peacetime expansions, the 58-month recovery from March 1975 to January 1980, had three isolated quarters of declining GNP.

 Negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have ended face-to-face meetings, but they remain willing to talk if it will avert an Aug. 4 strike, the two sides said Wednesday. In an order preventing an earlier walkout, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said a strike against <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; NW would disrupt essential rail shipping in several <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states and halt service for 40,000 Chicago-area commuters. Two days of bargaining in the presence of federal mediators ended Tuesday without a settlement, and the company said no new sessions were planned. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> was quoted Wednesday as saying the company would go ahead with plans to eliminate the jobs of 1,156 brakemen next week and that the union can strike. However, another spokesman said C & amp; NW remains willing to negotiate. `` We have left the door open for further talks if the union's willing to come and sit down,'' North Western's <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloedorn </PERSON> said `` But if there's no hint that there's going to be any place to negotiate, there's no sense in meeting for nothing.'' <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, meanwhile, said his union would return to the bargaining table whenever the company wants to talk. `` We're perfectly willing to negotiate and attempt to resolve it,'' <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. `` But the carrier seems determined to precipitate a strike.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> wants to eliminate the jobs of 1,156 of its 2,600 unionized brakemen, changing the makeup of most train crews from an engineer, conductor and two brakemen to only an engineer and conductor. The nation's eighth-largest rail carrier said it could save $ 51 million a year and become more competitive if it made the cuts, but the union said the action would compromise safety and violate its contract. <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> members threatened to walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 4 if the company makes the cuts. An emergency board appointed by the president in April to intervene in the dispute issued a report July 1 proposing the layoff of 689 brakemen, cuttng one brakeman per train in most cases and both brakemen when approved by an arbitrator on a train-by-train basis. Both sides rejected the report, the union calling it too sweeping and the company saying it did n't go far enough. Union and company bargainers had broken off negotiations on March 22 but resumed talks Monday under the supervision of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` If either party refuses to meet, there's not much we can do about it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, executive director of the federal agency.

<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury indicted 23 people Wednesday on charges they took part in an operation that may have shipped hundreds of tons of highly potent marijuana to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years. The indictments stemmed from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s seizure last month of 72 tons of pot _ worth an estimated $ 280 million _ from a ship off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. The ship was from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Among those charged in the 10-count indictment was <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a New Yorker living in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, who was identified as the organizer of the operation. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 42, who was arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, was `` one of the major suppliers of marijuana to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, agent-in-charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> was charged with conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, the most serious of federal drug crimes, as well as conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana. Also indicted was the 18-member crew aboard the Encounter Bay when it was seized June 30 about 500 miles off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. Four others not on the ship also were charged. Among crew members indicted was <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Colflesh </PERSON>, the master of the Encounter Bay. His twin brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, also was charged and remains at large. Both were originally from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and have been living in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. All were charged with possession with intent to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana and with conspiring to import a like amount of the illegal plant into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said the indictment ends a four-year effort to break up <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>' alleged operation. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said in a statement that agents posing as fisherman brought about last month's bust. The high-grade Thai marijuana aboard Encounter Bay passed through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seized the drugs on June 30, court documents say. Papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and five other men met May 5 in a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> hotel room to plan a shipment aboard the converted oil rig supply ship. Two of the men were <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, undercover agents with the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, who posed as fishermen willing to use their boats to unload marijuana off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast for a cut of the profits. They were introduced by mutual associates, the court documents said. The agents said the others at the meeting included the Colflesh brothers and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Forwell </PERSON>, an Australian who the agents said established a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> company called Trademax to hire a crew, launder money and handle other arrangements. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> would supply the marijuana, affidavits said. He was known to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> as a major supplier of Thai marijuana since the early 1980s, and agency files listed him as the head of a marijuana growing operation in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said that in April they were shown a vessel in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The agents were told it was similar to the one that would transport the marijuana, court documents revealed. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> was able to learn the vessel to be used in the operation was the <LOCATION> Encounter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, which left <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> June 2, according to the ship's log The marijuana was loaded onto the Encounter Bay from <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>' vessel, the <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, off <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, about June 10, according to court documents Vietnamese soldiers were involved in the loading operation, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officer testified during a July 13 court hearing in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 Maestro <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, back this week before Soviet audiences for the first time in 29 years, led an international youth orchestra in an evening concert Wednesday before 4,000 Muscovites at Gorky Park. The Soviets, who sat packed together at the outdoor Green Theater near the banks of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, gave the American director, composer and musician a standing ovation that lasted for more than 10 minutes at the program's end. The gray-maned <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who wore a white sweatshirt despite the evening heat, finally silenced the applause by pointing to his wrist, then clasping his hands to form a pillow, miming that it was late and time for him to sleep. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who will turn 70 next month, led the 120-member Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival Orchestra in Soviet composer <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>'s Symphony No. 1, and in his own work titled `` Songfest.'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> wielded the baton with his customary brio, punching the air with his fist to show when piano chords should sound, swaying from side to side during a lyrical string passage and waving his left hand to coax more volume out of the young musicians, whose average age is 23. The concert was his second in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the orchestra, which includes musicians from 20 countries. He led the group at <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The ensemble will also play on Thursday in the Mirror Hall of <LOCATION> Hermitage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, whose compositions include the stage musical `` West Side Story,'' told reporters he hopes the performances will increase world understanding, as well as promote changes launched under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and Soviet leader. `` I admire infinitely more Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> than I do <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vice president and Republican presidential candidate -RRB-, from a point of view of statesmanship,'' he told a news conference held at the Ministry of Culture.. `` I hope in whatever small way we can to increase feelings of friendship and love between peoples of different cultures, backgrounds and political systems, and to encourage as much as possible the progressive movements taking place in this country as I work for them in my country. Proceeds from the concerts are being paid to the Soviet Cultural Fund and the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Fund, according to concert organizers and Culture Ministry officials. Tickets for Wednesday's performance cost $ 5. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> first visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to conduct in 1959, during the cultural `` thaw'' promoted by Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>.

 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told an evangelism meeting Wednesday night that young people can do more to curb drug abuse than `` all our drug agents and our police and our military combined.'' `` Because you're a threat to the drug culture, you have to expect to be criticized, even ridiculed when you make your anti-drug views known,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Evangelism. `` I understand it's sometimes not easy, especially when you're in high school,'' the first lady said in remarks prepared for delivery `` You may be told to mind your own business. You may be called a do-gooder. You may be called up-tight.'' `` In fact, you've already been called such things because you've stood up for Christ,'' she said `` When it comes to drugs, the reason for such put-downs is that you're a danger. You're a danger to the drug attitudes that have ruled this country for the past two decades.'' She said young people who oppose illicit drug use should persevere in their efforts to stop it. `` Young people have more power to stop drugs than all our drug agents and our police and our military combined,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has conducted a `` just-say-no'' anti-drug abuse campaign among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth for the past several years, was to receive a special `` Youth for Christ'' award at the event.

 Striking scriptwriters returned to picket lines Wednesday after a marathon bargaining session failed to resolve differences between writers and producers that have hobbled most Hollywood production. Meanwhile, the writers' bargaining position appeared to be strengthened when a group of dissident writers announced they would not break away from the union, as they had threatened. A federal mediator called off talks between negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday morning after a 20-hour session failed to settle the dispute, now in its 21st week. New talks are expected to be announced soon. The latest talks, which began on Saturday, were conducted under a news blackout and details of the negotiations have been limited. More than 1,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> picketed at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> studios and at the offices of television producer <ORGANIZATION> Aaron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spelling </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. Pickets drew encouragement from Tuesday night's announcement by a splinter group called the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> that they would not resign from the guild. The coalition said it will support the bargaining process until `` it is either successfully concluded or proves barren.'' The group had been widely blamed for splitting the guild in a 1985 strike and union members had expressed fears that any resignations now would weaken their bargaining stance. `` It's a victory for guild solidarity,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, author of `` Beverly Hills Cop'' and `` The Big Easy'' and an outspoken critic of the coalition, said while picketing outside <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` It will make the negotiating process a lot cleaner.'' `` Twilight Zone'' and `` Star Trek'' writer <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said, `` There is total solidarity. It's like the old days of organizing the auto plants.'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, refused to comment Wednesday about the strike and the coalition's change of heart. In a further show of guild unity, more than 150 leading writers took out advertisements in entertainment industry newspapers Wednesday supporting the guild's bargaining position. `` The Writers Coalition claims to represent the lion's share of ` working' writers,'' the advertisement reads. `` This claim is both offensively elitist and patently untrue.'' The statement was signed by <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> -LRB- `` Sunset Boulevard'' -RRB-, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> -LRB- `` All the President's Men'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> -LRB- `` Cheers'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> -LRB- `` Family Ties.'' -RRB- The writers and producers remained divided mainly on payments for reruns of one-hour shows rebroadcast domestically and all programs rebroadcast overseas. The strike continues to result in layoffs throughout the entertainment industry. MGM and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> studios notified numerous producers this week that their `` services had been terminated.'' `` It is with regret that we notify you that due to such strike we are hereby terminating -LRB- the company's -RRB- services,'' the letters said, citing the extenuating circumstances clause in their contracts.

<TEXT>
 The well-received Democratic National Convention boosted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to his biggest lead of the presidential campaign, 18 points over Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a poll released Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew 50 percent support to 32 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> national survey of 1,770 registered voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had led by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll. The national nominating conventions often provide candidates a boost in the polls, especially when the conventions proceed as harmoniously as the Democrats' did last week. The bounce usually settles as the race proceeds. Other recent surveys have found the jump in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support. Two Gallup polls done after the convention had the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor ahead by 17 points, and he led by 10 points in one poll and by 12 in another conducted during the convention. The NBC-Journal poll found women providing a major component of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support, a continuation of the `` gender gap'' suffered by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led by 30 points among women, 54-24, compared to a six-point lead among men. The poll also found that two-thirds of the Democrats who bolted the party to vote for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said they would come back and vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And it said 71 percent of respondents, and 52 percent of blacks, believed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had treated <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fairly at the convention. The survey was conducted by telephone Saturday through Monday among a random sample of adult Americans. It had a margin of error of three points.

<TEXT>
 In the wake of the drowning death of a recruit, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has reviewed its training programs and concluded that there were no major problems, a top service official said Wednesday. `` The results of the review indicated that there were problems, but they were not severe and, with few exceptions, training was being conducted in a safe and proper manner,'' said Vice Adm. <PERSON> Nils </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s education and training branch. `` We found no major systemic problems,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` Other than the Rescue Swimmer School, there were no training areas in which the cumulative effects of improper supervision, incorrect practices and poor administration were degrading the safety of training.'' The review was conducted after the March 2 death of a 19-year-old recruit at the <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Five enlisted <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> instructors have been charged in the case, including one who was charged with involuntary manslaughter The other four were charged with conspiracy to commit battery. The recruit, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, died after he panicked, climbed out of a pool, shouted that he was quitting and then had his head held under water. <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> trains 80,000 officer and enlisted students daily in 3,200 different courses at 29 bases. All of them were reviewed in the wake of the <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> case to make sure they were safe, he told the military personnel subcommittee. Some training rules have been changed. For example, <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON> said, students will have the opportunity in course critiques to comment on training practices they thought were unsafe and whether the instructors were sensitive to safety issues. In addition, instructors will be evaluated on whether they maintain safe practices, he said. A top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official told the subcommittee that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a good safety record, `` considering the dangerous nature of much of military training and the large number of personnel trained.'' But the Pentagon is still trying to improve its record, said Marine Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukeman </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of defense for manpower.

<HEAD>Newspaper Comes Back Punching After 15 Days Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, returned to print Wednesday counter-punching after its 15-day shutdown by the government. The newspaper's Wednesday edition accused the leftist Sandinista government of violating the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan known in the region as <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II. It ran a special section with a banner headline saying: `` Five Simultaneous Blows To Esquipulas II.'' The government ordered closure of the 60-year-old newspaper on July 11, the day after a large opposition rally in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION> ended in violence between <LOCATION> Sandinista </LOCATION> police and demonstrators. About 40 protesters were arrested. The government accused <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> of reporting falsely on the protest and of `` inciting violence, disorder and disrespect for authorities.'' La Prensa denied any wrongdoing. The newspaper countered Wednesday that the government had dealt several recent `` blows'' to the regional peace plan. It cited its own suspension, the actions of police at Nandaime, the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven American diplomats accused of backing a plan to destabilize the Sandinista government, and the expropriation of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s largest private surgar mill. At the same time the government closed <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, it also took off the air for an undetermined time the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, as well as a private news show on the Radio Noticias station. On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced a 48-hour suspension of a news broadcast by the staunchly anti-government <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. A ministry statement said the program `` transmitted false news,'' but it did not elaborate. The Sandinistas maintained strict media censorship from 1982 until last January, when a state of emergency was lifted. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was shut down for 15 months on June 26, 1986, a day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 100 million in aid for the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government. Radio <PERSON> Catolica </PERSON> was closed for almost two years for failing to broadcast President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s year-end address on Dec. 31, 1985. They both were allowed to reopen last October under the regional peace plan signed Aug. 7, 1987 by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

 The Office of Government Ethics said Wednesday it has launched an analysis of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s activities in the wake of an 814-page report stemming from a criminal investigation of the attorney general OGE Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said the analysis is under way and that the office will respond to a request from Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., for the results of the ethics office's study The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a separate ethics inquiry of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, based on the department's standards of conduct for employees. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said he is reviewing the lengthy report on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, reports by <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s subcommittee on oversight of government management and Tuesday's testimony by former deputy attorney general <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and ex-criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. He is reviewing all these sources `` with a view toward determining whether there existed any violation'' of a 1965 executive order or model standards of conduct issued by the ethics office, said <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>'s comments came following a request from <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who said he wants the ethics office to launch an inquiry of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s acceptance of benefits from longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s request on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project may have violated a 1965 executive order detailing standards of ethical conduct for government officers, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>. Those standards prohibit an official from taking anything of value from someone who is seeking to obtain business with the official's agency. The standards also direct federal employees to avoid conduct which might create the appearance of using public office for private gain or giving preferential treatment to someone or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the integrity of government. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s request follows the report on the attorney general issued July 18 by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who decided not to seek an indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, even though <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded he probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a federal conflict-of-interest statute. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> found no basis for action in connection with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project or his dealings with financial manager <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, to whom <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was steered by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> turned a $ 40,000 profit for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 55,000 investment in just 18 months. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> reached no conclusions on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical behavior. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said that among the benefits <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> received from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> were arranging two loans for him, arranging for <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> to be <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial manager and helping to arrange a $ 40,000-a-year job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> In an appearance Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, said he concluded before resigning in protest March 29 that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct gave the appearance of partiality to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and constituted the use of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s public office for private gain. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the attorney general probably also had violated the federal gratuities law. He said that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who is a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney and longtime friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. In his letter to <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said, `` Although Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has announced his intention to leave office in the next month, a determination of the relevant ethics issues remains important, particularly because of the visibility of this case and Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued strong denial of any impropriety on his part. `` Without a public finding on these issues, questions will remain as to whether such conduct was in accordance with the standards of conduct applicable to all federal employees,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> added. In response, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> `` does know how to beat a dead horse.'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said it is `` supremely ironic'' that <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who played a key role in enacting legislation re-authorizing independent counsels, `` should be so unwilling to accept an independent counsel's findings as final.'' The Office of Professional Responsibility is using <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report as a basis <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> has not yet decided precisely what areas to focus on in regard to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities, according to government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. In addition to the inquiry by <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> and the analysis by the ethics office, the state bar of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has requested a copy of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report to review <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is licensed to practice law in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. OPR can recommend a range of actions against a federal employee, including dismissal, but <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is leaving government next month to join the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

 Police arrested about 30 students who held a demonstration outside <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Wednesday demanding expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and marking the 35th anniversary of the Korean war's end. Students yelled `` Yankee go home!'' and tried to stage a peaceful sit-down protest at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 8th Army headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but hundreds of riot officers forced them into police buses. At the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, officials said the legislators were ready to accept a request from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for talks on a non-aggression pact and the North's possible participation in the Olympic Games in September. The war began in 1950 when the North invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 2,000 radical students and dissidents rallied later in the day at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, then half the crowd marched to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. Thousands of riot police followed the march, blocked the way less than a mile from the embassy and persuaded the protesters to move into a nearby park, where they dispersed voluntarily. `` Down with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which forced partition of the Korean peninsula!'' protesters shouted, demanding the withdrawal of 42,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers based here under a defense treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other nations intervened on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s side during the war and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The war ended in a stalemate and armistice July 27, 1953, but the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> remain technically at war because no treaty has been signed. Radical students say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is responsible for the peninsula's continued division and claim it treats the South as a colony. They have called for immediate reunification, but have little public support. Assembly officials said representatives of the top four political parties and Speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON> agreed to accept the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> offer and the agreement would be conveyed to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s capital, on Aug. 1 after party leaders give formal approval. Lawmakers added, however, that they want preliminary talks at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> border truce village to work out preliminary details for negotiations. They recommended a meeting in the second week of August. `` The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is ready to take up the Olympic issue and does not want to limit the agenda,'' one aide said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has indicated it does not want preliminary talks. South Korean media reports earlier this week said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> considered them a waste of time. The North Koreans sent a proposal to the South last week calling for talks between their legislatures on a non-aggression pact and suggested the first round be held in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. In a second letter Tuesday, the <PERSON> North </PERSON> said it also was ready to discuss entering the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on condition its demand to be co-host was discussed. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have refused to let the North be co-host because the Games are awarded to a single city. The North has said it will boycott the Games. Three previous rounds of talks on easing tension and establishing relations ended in failure. The North ended the most recent series in 1986.

<HEAD>Senate Adopts Amendment Which Could Move U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted an amendment Wednesday which would allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to move its embassy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> despite the international controversy over such a step. The amendment, proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, was incorporated into a $ 15 billion appropriations bill adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the 1989 funding of the State, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Commerce departments. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' provision authorizes funds for building two diplomatic facilities in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, provided that each one `` equally preserves the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to locate its ambassador or its consul general at that site.'' The Helms amendment also would not allow the administration to designate either building as the new embassy until construction of one is near completion. The amendment does not give a dollar figure for the construction project. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, along with nearly all the other foreign missions in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, currently is located in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> even though <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> its capital. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a consulate in Jewish <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and another in the predominantly <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy over more than two decades has been to leave the embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> as long as the status of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> has not been resolved by international arbitration. Especially contentious is the question of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1967 annexation of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which it captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in what is known as the Six-Day War. The question of the embassy's location is a very emotional one for Moslems around the world, who consider <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as one of their most venerated shrines. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, unwilling to offend the Moslem world, has fought to keep the embassy from moving there. The issue has periodically come up during <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election campaigns, serving as a litmus test for a candidate's support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic candidate this year, said in an interview recently that he would favor locating the embassy in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> because that is the city <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers its capital. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, who wants the embassy moved, said in floor debate on his proposal that because both new facilities will be `` equally capable of serving as our embassy, subsequent presidents will be able to select which site should serve as the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Embassy.'' For the past three years <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> has blocked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request to build a new embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and a new consulate in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The current buildings are old and crowded. The bill now goes to a joint <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to iron out differences.

 American <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>'s delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and his administrative assistant conspired to defraud the government of more than $ 130,000 by putting ghost employees on their congressional payroll, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office announced Wednesday An eight-page information filed in conjunction with a plea agreement reached with the two defendants said Fofo I.F. <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and his aide used the money they obtained from the scheme to entertain constituents, pay election campaign expenses and make house and car loan payments. The document filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said that from February 1983 to August 1986 <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and assistant <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> falsely certified to the House finance office that people living in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> and elsewhere were employed in <LOCATION> Sunia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> congressional office. The ghost employees were n't even aware their names were listed as congressional employees, said the office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>' office said in a statement that <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> will appear in court to enter guilty pleas `` in the very near future.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Comeaux </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the delegate is out of town and referred all calls to his attorney, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON>, who was not immediately available for comment, his secretary said. <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON>'s assistant forged endorsements of paychecks issued for the ghost employees and deposited the money in his own bank account and in <LOCATION> Sunia </LOCATION>'s election campaign account. The first count of the information said <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> conspired to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of more than $ 130,000, a crime punishable with up to five years' imprisonment and a $ 250,000 fine. The second count said <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> submitted a false payroll document as part of the fraud scheme in violation of a federal law prohibiting false statements, a crime that carries up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. The case stemmed from an investigation by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. According to the information filed in court, documents including payroll information and oath of office forms were prepared, forged and submitted to the office of finance so that payroll checks would be issued in the names of each of the people named on the forms. For some of <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON>'s congressional employees who terminated their employment, <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> delayed officially notifying the finance office of their termination without the knowledge of the employees in order to generate additional payroll checks which were then taken by <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON>. The checks were forged by <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> and proceeds were deposited to the personal accounts of <LOCATION> Iuli </LOCATION>, the `` Committee to <ORGANIZATION> Elect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fofo </ORGANIZATION>'' election campaign account, forwarded unendorsed to <ORGANIZATION> Samoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> or presented in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> for cash. Some 78 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> checks totalling $ 130,920.50 for 14 ghost employees were wrongfully used by <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> during the conspiracy, said the information. The funds were administered by <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> and paid hotel and meal expenses of visiting constituents and staff members, election campaign expenses and furnished air travel for <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON> and members of his family. On a monthly basis, <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON> falsely certified on payroll certification forms submitted to the finance office that the employees had performed their assigned official duties.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Says Its Pilots May Take Stimulants On Long Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots sometimes take drugs to help them stay awake on long flights, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. A rash of accidents have caused worry about the safety of low-level training flights. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was responding to a report on West German television. Tuesday night's broadcast, by <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots assigned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> take the drug dextroamphetamine Dexedrine to increase their alertness while in flight. ARD quoted an unidentified a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer as saying <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots routinely use Dexedrine. Pilots use the drug `` so that they are able to fly when they have n't gotten enough sleep or do n't feel fit enough,'' ARD quoted the officer as saying. The ARD report also said pilots then take the sedative Seconal at night to counteract the effects of Dexedrine. However, in an official statement from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> stated `` categorically'' that its `` pilots do not take medication for normal, day-to-day training flights.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters sweeping over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are a common sight while they practice low-level missions in designated areas. Worries grew after five F-16 fighter jets crashed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within three months this year. On June 29, three <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16s crashed in two accidents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. One pilot was killed when two of the jets collided in the air. On March 31, another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 crash in the town of <LOCATION> Forst </LOCATION>, killing the pilot and a person on the ground. The accident came one day after a French Mirage jet fighter crashed in southern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> near a nuclear power plant. On April 18, a pilot was slightly injured when he ejected from his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 as it crashed near the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> border. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> statement said: `` The use of stimulant and sedative medications is limited by regulation to flights in which the length or precise schedule of the mission presents a significant risk of flight safety due to fatigue.'' `` Dexedrine and Seconal use almost exclusively involves solo flights to or from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas bases,'' it said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Neunherz </PERSON>, the chief spokesman at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, emphasized that a pilot would only use the sedative `` once he's back on the ground. `` He could take it after he's landed to help get his body clock back in order,'' <PERSON> Neunherz </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. He said a pilot would only take Dexedrine if he felt fatigue during a long mission. `` Routine use of these medications is never advised. They are to be used only in the event that an air crew member feels fatigue may jeopardize flight safety if the medications are not used,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s written statement said. `` In most instances, the prescribed medication is not taken by the air crew member,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Restaging of Pageant Brings Complaints of Racism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Complaints that the 1988 Miss District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> pageant was unfair prompted contest officials to restage the event and now contestants say the second go-round smacks of racism. <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was named the winner on June 24, but when contestants started grumbling to national pageant officials about the judging process, the slate was scratched and the entire affair was repeated on Saturday, said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Noreen </PERSON> <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrin </PERSON> _ originally the fourth runner-up _ walked away the winner on Saturday. Miss <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> became first runner-up. Two of the original 13 contestants did not return, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said Wednesday. Miss <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said she was `` embarrassed'' and `` humiliated'' by the incident. `` I'd like to be the one to go to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because I won the first pageant fair and square,'' she said, `` and there was bias and unfairness in the second.'' She told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that she plans to sue the Miss America Pageant. The second contest prompted allegations of racism, since Miss <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> is black and Miss <PERSON> Morrin </PERSON> is white. The panel of judges in the first pageant was predominantly black, as is the population of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, while the second panel was mostly white. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> defended the decision to hold a second pageant. `` It was not an easy decision to make. It's not an easy thing to tell a girl who won that she has to try again,'' he said. `` But the girls were the ones up in arms,'' he said. `` Within 24 hours of the original pageant, we started receiving complaints from some of the contestants, who ultimately banded together and complained the pageant was not held fairly.'' An investigation by national pageant officials revealed that at least one of the original judges knew several contestants, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` We learned that one judge was on the faculty of a school where at least two contestants were students, and knew the contestants or at least knew of them,'' he said. `` The foundation of our system is that none of the judges knows anything about the contestants,'' he said. `` The only thing they should see are the four competitions,'' which include the talent, evening gown and swimsuit portions and a personal interview. Further investigation revealed that the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> pageant, in his first year as head of the event, selected the head of the judge's committee to serve as a judge, replacing one who canceled. `` That's also an infraction, because that committee head sees the young ladies in rehearsal and in circumstances other than in competition,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` The young ladies were unhappy and knew it was not fair,'' he said. The only option was to rehold the pageant, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said, using judges selected by the national pageant office. The director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> pageant, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, has `` been advised to cease and desist from any further activities, and we are looking for a new franchise owner,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` We're not impugning his integrity and we're not suggesting improper motives,'' he said, `` but in his zeal to run the pageant, he made serious errors.''

<HEAD>Arias Says Peace Plan Still Valid Despite Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said Wednesday that although the nations of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have failed to fulfil all their obligations under a regional peace plan, `` We can not lose faith.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for the plan that he originated, singled out <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in particular for criticism during a brief news conference. He said the main objective of his five-hour visit to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> was to show his affection for and solidarity with `` a very dear friend,'' President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has terminal liver cancer. His doctors give him between six and 18 months to live. `` I am certain that when the history of the decade of the 1980s in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is written ... the predominant role could not be denied <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> for his consolidation of democracy and liberty here in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> sat at <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' side, but took no questions. Most of <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' comments concerned the regional peace plan known as <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II that he, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> signed in <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> on Aug. 7, 1987. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said there `` has been progress and there has been backsliding'' over the last 12 months. But he said, `` We can not lose faith in <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION>. If the will existed to reach accords last Aug. 7, today the world demands that the same will exist to carry out what we committed ourselves to.'' The plan called for dialogue between government and insurgents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and for political amnesties and greater democracy in the region. `` If we weigh the plan, on balance what we have achieved is more positive than negative ...,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. `` We're not completely satisfied. None of the Central American countries has been able to fulfill all its obligations.'' The accord helped ease hostilities between the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but had almost no effect on the Salvadoran and Guatemalan civil wars. The five presidents tentatively planned to meet on Aug. 7, the first anniversary of the peace plan. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is to leave Aug. 1 for a week of treatment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said recently no plans for a summit exist. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said Wednesday a summit is `` pending'' but with no date, place or agenda as yet. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said regarding <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>: `` Lately, the backsliding that has caused me the most pain is seeing the closure of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the jailing of demonstrators for merely wanting to freely express their opinions.'' Nicaraguan police reacted with violence to a big opposition rally July 10. The government later closed <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, the only opposition newspaper, and muzzled several broadcast outlets. La Prensa resumed publishing Wednesday after a 15-day suspension but <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station, is still off the air. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> lamented that `` dogmatic and intransigent people'' dominated both sides of the Nicaraguan conflict. `` There are people in the Contras that do n't want democracy because they know that if there were democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, they'd have to live their whole lives in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' he said `` And there are people in the Sandinista government who do n't want democracy because they only know how to fire a machine gun, because they find that a regime like that needs excuses, and they find the excuses in military struggle ... excuses for not having enough food, the poverty, the hunger, the misery. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also chided <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> for arranging to meet with only four of the five Central American foreign ministers in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Aug. 1. `` If he would have asked my advice, I would have recommended the inclusion of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. `` But he did not ask me.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Final Fiscal 1988 Money Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> put the final piece into a budget-balancing puzzle before heading off Wednesday on a presidential campaign swing. The $ 124 million bill closed the books on fiscal 1988, which ended 27 days earlier. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signed the measure about 5 p.m., just before leaving his Statehouse office. Unlike the full-fledged news conference <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held on July 17 to announce signing a scaled-down $ 11.6 billion state budget for fiscal 1989, there was no fanfare to mark the governor's last act in erasing a $ 400 million shortfall in fiscal 1988. The signing of the measure was announced by the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> press office by title only in a list of 28 bills Press aides could not say specifically what it contained. The late action on the money bill was due to `` negotiations and trying to make sure we did n't have a replay of what happened with some of the vetoes that happened on -LRB- fiscal -RRB- 1989,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lelyveld </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and Finance. Those problems included the announcing of cuts for legislative commissions and other programs which the governor later said would be funded. Major spending in the fiscal 1988 deficiency bill included $ 37 million to help hospitals offset losses in federal <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> funds, $ 56 million for underfunded Medicaid accounts and $ 3.2 million for underfunded Aid to Families with Dependent Children accounts. The hospital Medicare payments were added by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to meet commitments under the new universal health care act. The $ 37 million <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agreed upon was still $ 13 million less than the act's full commitment of $ 50 million _ representing the largest veto contained in the bill. Another controversial item vetoed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have benefited <ORGANIZATION> Southwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said the continued operation of a newly opened substance abuse center named for the governor's wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, was threatened if the hospital did n't get the $ 2 million to $ 3 million appropriation. In his veto message, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the `` current hospital reimbursement system provides sufficient flexibility to address <PERSON> Southwood </PERSON>'s problems'' without having to give <PERSON> Southwood </PERSON> a special appropriation.

<HEAD>Senate Approves $7.5 Million For TV Aimed At Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved spending $ 7.5 million to establish a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government television service to beam <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news and entertainment programs to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. TV Marti, which would supplement <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, would `` accelerate the free flow of information to our friends in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, sponsor of the measure. The money was earmarked in the 1989 budget of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which was included in an appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> and the judiciary approved 80-16. The bill now goes to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. The service would provide a variety of shows _ from news and information to sitcoms and soap operas. The $ 7.5 million would cover the cost of setting up a TV studio, recruiting and training staff and conducting a 90-day operating test. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> opposed the TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> proposal because of the possibility of retaliatory jamming by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> of American radio stations and potential interference to southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> TV stations from the TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> signal itself. But the NAB applauded a provision in the bill that would hold up funding for full operation of the service until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> holds hearings and decides whether TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> would violate international treaty obligations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Anti-Arab extremists increased armed patrols Wednesday to protect <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> travelers in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said they were irresponsible and seeking publicity. Two Palestinians were reported wounded by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where a rebellion against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8. At least 234 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the uprising. A prominent supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> called for recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and direct negotiations with it, echoing a new moderate position proposed recently by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>. `` As a Palestinian, my problem is with the Israelis, so I must speak with them,'' said <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. He was held for nine months without charges after being arrested last fall, and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yizhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> once called him the leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> commented Wednesday in a public meeting in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it describes as a terrorist organization, and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> hardliners have denounced the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> proposal for negotiations. The extremists patrolling east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> are members of the Kach movement, which is led by American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> and advocates expelling all Arabs from Israeli-held lands. The patrols began Sunday. On Wednesday, Kach members toured east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in six white vans identified by Hebrew signs reading `` escort vehicle.'' At least one person armed with a rifle or pistol rode in each van, a patrol coordinator said. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio: `` I think they are absolutely negative. They are absolutely irresponsible elements, and one has to do everything to stop it.'' The mayor, who has championed the city's unity throughout his career, said police could handle security problems in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where Israeli buses often are stoned. He accused Kach followers of conducting the escorts to `` make headlines.'' Four Kach members and an Orthodox Jewish journalist who accompanied the extremists were detained for questioning Wednesday, but were later released, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Nurit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouton </PERSON>. `` There was a suspicion they would be provocative,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bouton </PERSON> said. Israeli officials have said they can only stop the patrols if Kach members carry unlicensed weapons or violate the law. `` The worst that can happen is that some of our guys get put in jail for a few hours, and are then released,'' said <PERSON> Gadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Servetman </PERSON>, a Kach activist who volunteered to participate in a patrol Wednesday. `` We wo n't stop.'' In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, troops wounded a 16-year-old Arab when they opened fire to break up a demonstration, the army said. The army accused the youth of instigating the demonstration. `` He stood in front of all his friends and called ` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> akhbar!' -LRB- God is great! -RRB-,'' the army spokesman said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of Dheishe near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, soldiers shot a 23-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> in the leg after residents stoned Israeli cars on the highway passing the camp, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police investigating last week's shooting death of a 15-year-old <PERSON> Jerusalem </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> said Wednesday he apparently was killed by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabadi </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> resident to be killed during the nearly 8-month-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> uprising, and his death July 19 caused riots in the disputed city. The investigation said the incident began when <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths stoned an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. A settler and two reserve soldiers got off the bus, and started chasing the stone-throwers, the report said. The settler fired his pistol in the air, and the two soldiers fired their rifles, the report said. The settler could not have fired the fatal shot because he was too far from <PERSON> Rabadi </PERSON>, the radio quoted investigators as saying. <PERSON> Rabadi </PERSON>'s relatives have said he was not involved in stone-throwing and was riding his bicycle when he was killed. Army officials said without elaborating that military police would now take up the investigation.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Dismisses United Europe As `Airy Fairy'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, long accused of an insular attitude toward the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, on Wednesday dismissed as `` airy-fairy'' suggestions for tighter political union among European Economic Community nations. She also ruled out a central bank for the 12-nation trade bloc. It was Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s most outspoken criticism yet of what she regards as impractical overenthusiasm for some kind of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` They spend far too much time talking about these airy-fairy ideas,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told a radio interviewer who asked her about proposals for a federal government for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` They say ` Let's have European union.' I say ` What do you mean, because I ca n't see any of you dissolving your own countries into a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'.'' She spoke on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Jimmy Young Show,'' a mixture of chatty interviews and popular music aimed mainly at housewives. Last week, the prime minister did not reappoint to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> commissioner, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockfield </PERSON>, who was masterminding an alignment of sales taxes throughout the trade bloc _ a move Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposed. Aligning of taxes is part of preparations for 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is due to become a single market without trade barriers. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Cockfield </PERSON> with <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> left her Cabinet in 1986 after siding with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in a dispute over a helicopter company, <ORGANIZATION> Westland </ORGANIZATION>, and then taking the blame for leaking a confidential document. Critics charged that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has repaid <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>, 48, for permanent exclusion from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and also hoped for a more amenable commissioner. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said Wednesday that the prime minister sent <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to `` get him out of the way,'' but predicted <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> would avenge his being fired from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> by following <PERSON> Cockfield </PERSON>'s line. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, whom Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ousted as <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in 1975, on Friday accused her of firing <PERSON> Cockfield </PERSON> `` out of sheer spite.'' He called it a disgrace and a public scandal. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> aides denied <PERSON> Cockfield </PERSON> was dropped because he became obsessed with <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> interests over British interests and pointed to his age, 71. However, <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>'s appointment was widely seen as underlining Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s differences with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> partners on continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, while nurturing a special relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argued Wednesday she is simply being practical about the limits of European union. `` The whole history of the two places is entirely different,'' she said of comparisons between West European nations and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It is not possible to have a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. What is possible is for the 12 countries of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> steadily to work more closely together on things we do better together, so that we can trade better together.'' She said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief official, erred in predicting that within a decade 80 percent of national decisions by member nations would be taken on a Europe-wide basis. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said no need existed for uniformity of sales taxes. As for an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> central bank, she said, that would mean surrendering `` fundamental economic decisions to another country... That I will not do. Opinion polls show British voters are less enthusiastic about closer ties within the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> than, say, the West Germans or the French.

 A welfare mother of five has been promised a job and a home in a middle-class neighborhood from a millionaire who says he just wanted to help real people. `` I ca n't believe this is happening to me,'' said 28-year-old <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. `` It's just a miracle from God. I've struggled and hoped for so long to get my children out of this neighborhood and into a safe environment.'' Businessman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> said he plans to buy a house for Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and her family and give her a college education, a job, a car and someone to care for her children, who range in age from one month to 10 years. `` The idea is to get <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> to become self-sufficient to the point where she can pay her own rent on the house, pay her own bills and do everything on her own someday,'' <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Wednesday. `` I plan to pay for everything until she reaches that point.'' He also wants Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s month-old son to be her last child. `` I just want Anita to be honest with me, I want her to become self-sufficient, and she has promised to have no more children,'' he said. `` I will see to it that she gets medical care as well to take care of that.'' <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>, a 43-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> native and the principal owner of six companies in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, said he was tired of donating to charities and not seeing the results. He went to <PERSON> Livia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and said he wanted to help real people he could see and talk to. `` Boy, have I got a family for you,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> had come to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s office five months pregnant and looking for help for her family. But she never dreamed of the likes of <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>, who she met just last Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>'s requirement that she have no more children was `` tiny'' compared with the chance he's giving her family. She said the drug-ridden, inner-city neighborhood where she lives now is so dangerous she does n't let her children play outside. `` Now my children will have a chance to start a fresh new life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` That's all I've ever prayed for. These kids deserve the best, and now, thanks to Mr. <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>, they will have it.''

<HEAD>Bigfoot Researcher Says Lizard Man Is `Skunk Ape'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNTOWN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials checking a teen-ager's report of a so-called `` Lizard Man'' found large tracks near Scape Ore Swamp, and a Bigfoot researcher says the creature is a `` skunk ape.'' The search began almost two weeks ago when 17-year-old <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says he was chased at speeds up to 40 mph by a tall, wet green creature after he changed a tire about 2 a.m. near a bean field. Since then, the swamp has been swamped with the curious, including scores of news people, and <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Liston </PERSON> <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> has fielded hundreds of calls about the beast. `` You're dealing with a skunk ape, which is a colloquial name. You can call it anything you want to, but it's a Bigfoot,'' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckjord </PERSON>, who has researched creature sightings for 10 years and interviewed <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. He said the Lizard Man sounds like the skunk ape that has reportedly been seen in woods and swamps around the country since 1958. A state trooper and sheriff's deputy on patrol near the swamp found the 14-inch by 7-inch tracks, and the sheriff made five sets of plaster casts of them. While <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> saw something, it probably was a bear. He said it's likely a prankster was at work Sunday when the tracks were found. `` Whoever did it, they sure did a convincing job,'' said the sheriff. The prints were found on a dirt road that parallels the swamp and traveled about 400 yards before stomping off into woods, <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> said. The sheriff asked the State Law Enforcement Division to send bloodhounds to scour the swamp. `` We could n't find anybody coming out of there. And if it was some ` thing,' we wanted to see if the dog would trail it,'' <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> said. The hounds, however, failed to pick up a scent, probably because of an afternoon rainstorm, said SLED spokesman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Munn </PERSON>. `` They did see tracks. They had three toes and dug down into the ground in six-foot strides. ... I ca n't even say this with a straight face,'' <PERSON> Munn </PERSON> said. But others have told <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> they, too, have seen the red-eyed creature, and this week the sheriff said he was tracking down reports of tracks seen after a January snowstorm.

<HEAD>$5 Billion Offer Made In Marcos Letter, Says US Historian</HEAD>

 Former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> definitely offered to provide $ 5 billion to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> historian who relayed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' feelers about returning to his homeland said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said the $ 5 billion offer was in a proposal brought to him by a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> representative and was part of the `` substance'' of a letter to him from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` I was approached last month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by a representative of former President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> with a list of proposed ` agreement points' for an arrangement which would allow his return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>. The points were `` conditioned by an offer on his part to accept the legitimacy of the Aquino government, stay out of politics, throw his support behind <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and provide her government with $ 5 billion,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> identified the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> emissary as <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> advertising man. In a statement Tuesday from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he lives in exile, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said `` negotiations'' about his return were taking place but denied that he had offered to pay the money in exchange for permission to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' denial. A source close to the discussions with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, insisting on anonymity, said the ousted president's statement appeared worded to provide him deniability. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> is president of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organization promoting democracy abroad and was a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer team to the 1986 Philippine elections. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> returned on July 13 with two letters signed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, one addressed to President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and one addressed to <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, `` which outlined what I view as Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' personal petition to the Philippine government'' said <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>. `` I sent President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s letter to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, assured that it would reach her, along with the substance, including the $ 5 billion figure, of what was contained in the letter to me,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. He said he also sent the contents of the letters to Philippine Ambassador <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. A <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed that the ambassador received <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' letter but added that the government does not take it seriously and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> did not receive it. A source knowledgeable of the Weinstein-Hoffman contacts said the $ 5 billion was explicitly mentioned in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' letter to <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> but not in the one to President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The letter `` is authentic, but the offer is phony,'' said <PERSON> Severina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government which is charged with recovering <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government has been not been negotiating with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stressed law-and-order issues Wednesday, meeting with his state anti-crime council and signing legislation to ease prison overcrowding and fight child pornography. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also took what should be the last step to close the books on the state's 1988 fiscal year, just meeting a deadline to sign legislation providing $ 124 million. The money is largely for underfunded entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Top aides to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, struck back in answer to Republican criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s search for a running mate was not going well. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself generally steered clear of such topics. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who embarks on a seven-state campaign swing Thursday, spent Wednesday tending to gubernatorial duties, meeting with his anti-crime council and signing into law measures that will add about 1,000 beds to the state's overcrowded prison system and restore a child-pornography statute struck down by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Later, he announced a number of other bill signings, including the deficiency budget legislation _ the governor's last act in erasing a $ 400 million shortfall during fiscal 1988, which ended June 30. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a public ceremony to sign the prison and child-pornography bills not long after senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides held a briefing at which they said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican nominee, and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were having to scramble to give their fall effort direction and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had begun his vice presidential search on a sour note. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to enter that fray, telling reporters he did not know details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s search and saying every candidate had a personal approach to such tasks. His aides were less kind. `` It is our view that the process has not begun well,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager. She cited reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a pollster, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, heading the search, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was requesting background information from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and other Republicans who were not being seriously considered, just to placate them. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans for what she called `` an early decision to go negative'' and attributed sharp criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by Republicans to a lack of good things to say about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It's a bit early in the campaign to have run out of positive things to say about your own candidate,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said. Many Democratic speakers at last week's Democratic National Convention, including keynoter <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at length, receiving loud applause for comments ridiculing the vice president. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to campaign during the Republican National Convention next month but that an itinerary had not been established. `` We do not plan any fishing or hunting trips during that period,'' she said, referring to a trip <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during the first few days of the Democratic convention. `` We plan to campaign.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in addition to signing the crime and prison bills Wednesday, announced distribution of $ 7.8 million in state and federal grants for victim assistance programs. He said that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has been a national leader in `` increasing sensitivity and awareness of what it is like to be a victim of crime,'' and he also said there has been a 13 percent drop in crime in his state in the past four years. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shrugged off questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that, until it was amended, allowed passes to first-degree murderers, including a man who escaped from a furlough and raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. `` I've got a record,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, referring to the crime statistics and other programs. `` I do n't know what the vice president's record is.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, encouraging a reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, praised Hungarian Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> Wednesday for `` your openness to new ideas.'' At the conclusion of the first-ever official White House visit by a <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> agreed that economic reform in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will necessitate a freer political climate. `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has to face enormous tasks today,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said through an interpreter during a departure statement on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> of the White House. `` This can only be done, we are aware, if the people, if the citizens enjoy more rights, more freedoms.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, `` We are encouraged by your recognition that economic reforms can not succeed unless acompanied by political reforms as well.'' The president said that decisions to be made by <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' government in the coming months `` will set the direction of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s development over the next decade,'' adding that `` we have been impressed with your openness to new ideas. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> replied that `` we are modernizing our political system and our political practices.'' At a news conference Wednesday night, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said his visit symbolized a `` new era of detente'' in East-West relations which `` provides not only the superpowers but the small and medium-sized powers with the opportunity to participate in a dialogue.'' He said the current relaxation of tensions is `` much deeper'' and `` much richer'' than the detente era of the 1970's. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the administration promised to review ways in which Hungarian products can have greater access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who leaves <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Thursday, indicated in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> speech that political reform has to be carried out within the framework of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s one party state. A senior administration official, describing Wednesday's talks on grounds he not be publicly identified, acknowledged there was no discussion between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> of any possible move to a multi-party system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. This official said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted to focus attention on <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> because of the Hungarian's interest in establishing economic ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his willingness to consider internal change. This official said that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has improved its human rights situation, it could do more in the area of permitting demonstrations and dissent. But he said `` freedom of travel'' from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country has improved substantially. The official also said the two leaders did not discuss the question of possible withdrawal of the 65,000 Soviet troops based in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Several weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had received increasing indications that a Soviet military retreat from its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally was likely. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> gathering that any Soviet troop pullback from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would have to be part of general scaling down of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The visit was the first ever by a <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> party leader since the country came under <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rule 40 years ago. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became premier a year ago and was named party chief in May.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> named <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> newspaper editor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> as president of its struggling news division on Wednesday, hours after <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said he was leaving because `` it has n't been all that fun lately.'' `` Different times call for different types of people,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said as he announced the appointment. <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> has most recently been a part-time general news executive with <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and editor of the Ames, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> A former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, he is also former editor of The Courier-Journal of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- Register and the front page of The Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, who left public broadcasting four years ago to join the network, said he is quitting because of differences with the executives installed by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which bought the network in 1986. `` It's time for them to get their own guy in there,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he was attending an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` Things have changed. It has n't been all that fun lately. I've been there four years It's a difference in style, personality and priorities.'' <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said that he had met <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> a couple of months ago, in a meeting about First Amendment issues. He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had asked to meet him in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and offered the job last Wednesday. `` He wants me to lead, he wants me to manage, he wants me to use my news judgment, and he wants me to be a good businessman,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview, `` but most of all he wants me to think about the future and help lead <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> into the future, safely and soundly, and with vigor.'' <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said that he and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had not discussed the network's third-place position in the evening news ratings, or the possibility of launching another prime-time news program `` I'll go over there tomorrow and meet everybody, and I assume I'll start working,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said. Though he had not been to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> headequarters Wednesday, he added, `` I think I started working today.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON>, the veteran <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent and commentator, said he has known <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> for many years and praised the appointment as `` audacious and intelligent.'' `` We get various reactions to it around the water cooler here,'' <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> said in an interview. `` One is that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has set good journalism as his first priority _ that's obviously clear. Another reaction I would have is that <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> will be able to prove that good journalism is the heart of the enterprise.'' <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, 49, veered off the fast track in 1987 to become editor at the 10,000-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, which he owned with two partners. He continued to hold the title of General News Executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and divided his time between <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Those who have worked with <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, who is also a lawyer, describe him as a creative, hard-driving editor with an ability to inspire a staff. `` He has an electric personality,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, editor of the Des Moines Register. `` He's a brilliant journalist, a great idea person and a very outgoing personality who had good effects on morale in the newsroom.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> has `` an energy field that gets everybody fired up. He is just an exceptional individual. He's the best questioner I've ever heard in my life.'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> would retain the title of editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and plans to commute to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> on weekends. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> is former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, where he fostered PBS documentaries, including the award-winning series `` Frontline.'' During his tenure at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, `` Nightly News'' and the `` Today'' show rose to No. 1 in the ratings. Recently, though, `` Nightly News'' has fallen to third in the close competition among the evening newscasts. Although `` Today'' has remained in first place and expanded to `` Sunday Today,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> recently lost the show's executive producer, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, to <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, where he is producing `` USA Today: The Television Show.'' Despite its three-year first-place status in the prime-time ratings, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has not successfully launched a prime-time news show. The last was `` 1986,'' canceled before the end of the year for which it was named. The cancellation prompted the departure of anchor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, whose resignation was effective immediately, would n't say what his plans were other than to leave for a vacation Friday The change at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> marked the second time in a month that corporate bosses have reached outside the network to hire a news president. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> recently named <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> was promoted to head of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the drug-dealing case against reputed mobster <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and two co-defendants after a haggard jury announced it was deadlocked on the seventh day of deliberations. `` The time has come to declare a mistrial,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said before calling the jury back into the courtroom, ending the second trial stemming from a 1983 indictment. The earlier trial also ended with a mistrial in January. In that case, prosecutors accused the defendants of jury tampering, a charge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said remains under investigation. This time, the foreman of the anonymous jury said jurors were troubled by a defense claim that tape recordings, made from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bug placed in the kitchen of co-defendant <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>'s home, might have been tampered with by the government to fit the case. `` The jurors finally indicated their problem with the evidence is, in fact, tampering,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>. `` We only hope the court system will recognize this situation and correct it by dismissing the case so these defendants do not once again have to undergo criminal proceedings,'' he concluded. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRusso </PERSON> denied the tampering charges, but agreed with defense lawyers that no one was happy with the result. `` I feel empty, having been with it for so long and not having a resolution,'' said <PERSON> LaRusso </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishetti </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, brother of reputed <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family head <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, was not happy. `` He wants this matter resolved once and for all,'' the attorney said. And <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Santangelo </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON>, said, `` A mistrial is n't a victory. It's a non-verdict.'' <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Cedarhurst </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON>, 43, are charged in a 1983 indictment with supervising a multimillion-dollar heroin-smuggling operation. The judge set Sept. 7 as a tentative retrial date. The second trial began in May. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> had sent the jurors back to deliberate despite a pessimistic message from the anonymous panel's foreman: `` Your honor, it's a dead point. The jurors began rehearing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tapes Sunday as they considered charges of heroin possession, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, racketeering and running a continuing criminal enterprise. News of a deadlock surfaced after the jury sent a note to the judge at 11:45 a.m., that said, `` After breaking yesterday, we all gave serious thought to where we were heading _ it amounted to nowhere.'' `` We unanimously agreed that we will be unable to reach a verdict on any count, no matter how long we are asked to continue deliberating,'' said the note. Only 11 jurors were deliberating because one juror was excused after a federal marshal found several grams of cocaine in clothing that was delivered to him Tuesday, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said the matter is being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two acting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on Wednesday insisted the agency is running smoothly, with no hint of the `` deep malaise'' portrayed by two of their predecessors who quit in protest earlier this year.

On Tuesday, former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> testified that when he resigned March 29 a `` deep malaise'' had set in at the department in the face of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who preceded <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> as criminal division chief, told the committee that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a longtime friend of the attorney general. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> told the committee that when he went to the department from a top <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position, `` I was under the impression there was a black hole, that morale was shattered. I found that was not the case. Morale was not on the floor. `` I do n't think morale was as serious a problem as portrayed by Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, at least since April. At this time I think the department is functioning well.'' `` Have you seen an instance where <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> acted improperly?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION> and a Meese supporter. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>: `` All of my professional associations with the attorney general have been correct and proper.'' He called <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> `` professionals, men of integrity and decency,'' who simply had a different view of department morale. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who started at the department in June, said, `` No, I did n't see any malaise. I found the criminal division conducting itself according to the highest standards.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> told him `` There are some who will never like Attorney General <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The department functions well and does a good job.'' But the senator also had criticism for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, saying he `` probably should n't have made'' comments critical of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> on Monday. In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had conducted a competent and thorough preliminary inquiry of his conduct, there likely would have been no need for an independent counsel's investigation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has announced he will resign at the end of the month now that Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has decided not to bring charges against him following a lengthy investigation. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably committed'' three felonies and a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has sharply criticized the findings.

 A military judge Wednesday found Pvt. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> guilty of two AIDS-related court-martial charges but acquitted the soldier of other charges. Army Col. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> convicted <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of bringing discredit upon the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for engaging in unprotected sex early in 1987 after testing positive for presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus and having been counseled to take precautions if having sex. Cole also found <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> guilty of consensual sodomy with then-Pfc. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> during March 1987. The judge acquitted <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of aggravated assault against <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and a soldier identified only as Pfc. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. He also found <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> innocent of two counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of his sexual partners,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in acquitting <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of assault. `` By God's good grace, and blind luck, no one was infected.'' Cole later sentenced <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> to receive a bad-conduct discharge, but did not set a specific date for it. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is scheduled for release from the Army in November. The judge also restricted <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> for 60 days to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> outside this southeast <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> town, ordered him to forfeit $ 1,200 in pay over three months and ordered him not to have unprotected sex. The sodomy charge alone carried a maximum term of five years in prison. Cole had indicated previously that he would not impose a prison term on a discredit conviction. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> hugged his mother after the sentencing and told reporters he was `` surprised because I was expecting the whole 17'' years in prison, the maximum penalty if he had been convicted of all the charges. He said he had expected a heavy sentence `` because of the emotion surrounding it and the disease itself.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he would not stay in the military even if his automatic appeal is successful, but he said, `` I do n't feel any remorse toward the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the press.'' The bad conduct dischage is considered better than a dishonorable discharge because <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> may be entitled to retain some veterans benefits. Col. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beans </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, staff judge advocate at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> whose office prosecuted <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said he was trying to `` figure out the judge's logic with our failure to prove an aggravated assault. Quite frankly, I thought we did it, I thought we made our case.'' Beans said, `` The sentence is light, but you can understand that this soldier has had this cloud hanging over his head for 17 months.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was accused of having threatened the health of <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and two female soldiers by failing to use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested positive for the AIDS virus, which indicated he may develop AIDS and could spread it. He was the first member of the armed forces charged with AIDS-related offenses in March 1987. Legal issues delayed his trial, though, and military courts have tried other AIDS-related cases in the interim. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' case was `` fact-specific,'' involving knowledge about AIDS two years ago, and therefore would have little value as a precedent in other cases. Cole ruled after receiving written closing arguments from the prosecution and hearing oral arguments from the defense Wednesday afternoon. Capt. <PERSON> Gaylen </PERSON> <PERSON> Whatcott </PERSON>, the prosecutor, called 10 witnesses Tuesday, including <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' two alleged female victims. They testified that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had told them he had a rare or incurable blood disease but did not mention acquired immune deficiency syndrome before having sex with them. Cole permitted <PERSON> Whatcott </PERSON> to submit a transcript of pretrial testimony from <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> after the government said it was unable to find him for the trial. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>'s 1987 testimony included a description of homosexual activity with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. In addition, the judge allowed the prosecution to admit medical records reflecting <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' AIDS test results, despite defense objections that the government had not demonstrated sufficiently that adequate steps were taken to secure blood drawn in 1986 when <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was tested for AIDS.

 Two Democrats charged Wednesday that campaign tax proposals by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would undo `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s greatest achievement.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> said tax cuts suggested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would destroy the Reagan-backed Tax Reform Act of 1986. They specifically blasted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans to reduce the tax rate on capital gains, and to increase tax credits for oil and gas exploration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the capital-gains cut would stimulate investment and generate long-term revenue. The oil and gas breaks would restore an estimated $ 1 billion in credits lost by energy developers in the 1986 reforms. But <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a major figure in the writing of the 1986 tax-reform bill, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans `` an attempt to dismantle tax reform, which is <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s greatest achievement.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is practicing the old politics of pandering to the special interests,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> echoed the charge, saying the rich and powerful `` have never really had to ask where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was.

 An Irish teen-ager with a history of running away from home stowed away on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> guided missile destroyer, and five sailors accused of helping her during 10 days at sea have been arrested, officials said Wednesday. Police in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> identified the 16-year-old girl as <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>. She was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday after an illness delayed attempts to return her to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The five sailors accused of helping her during the USS Conyngham's trip were being held at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. The teen-ager was found aboard the destroyer Saturday when it returned from its visit to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. She was being taken to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a return flight when she became ill. After an emergency landing Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the girl was taken to <LOCATION> Rex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where was discharged Wednesday evening <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said travel arrangements were being made for the girl. He would not elaborate and neither he nor hospital officials knew where she was spending Wednesday night. The girl apparently slipped aboard the Conyngham while it was on a courtesy call in <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The ship held an open house during the visit, and that is apparently when the girl slipped aboard, officials said. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, said the girl was discovered in a 2 -LCB- - foot by 15-foot utility passage when the ship docked Five sailors who allegedly helped the girl are in the base brig, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. Some of the sailors apparently brought food and water to the girl during the 10-day <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> crossing. `` No charges have yet been filed,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said the girl was expected to be released from <ORGANIZATION> Rex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> sometime Wednesday to continue her trip home. Irish police said they expected her to take a Thursday flight from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the girl, escorted by an <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION> agent, was flown Tuesday from <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> From there, she and her escort boarded a flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where she was to catch a connecting flight to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` I understand she became ill on the flight to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, that she complained to her escort of nausea and then went into convulsions,'' NIS Agent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> said. The plane made an unscheduled landing in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> to drop her off. A <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> police spokesman, who would not give his name, said the girl was reported missing by her parents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>. The spokesman said the girl was the eldest of four children and had run away from home several times _ once having to be returned home from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The parents declined to talk with the press. The girl had originally told <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials that she was orphaned when she was 13 and always wanted to come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to find work. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the girl was treated for dehydration Saturday at the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. He said a full physical found no health problems. If charged and convicted, the five sailors face a maximum five years in prison and a fine of $ 2,000 for aiding an illegal entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Medicaid Abortion Payments To Rape, Incest Victims</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS new 3rd graf with final passage of appropriations
bill.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to extend Medicaid abortion payments to rape and incest victims, although President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he might veto a $ 140 billion appropriations bill over the issue. The 73-19 vote came during the third day of contentious debate on the fiscal 1989 appropriations bill for the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and Education. The massive spending bill, covering most of the nation's social spending, was approved 80-16 at the end of a confusing day of parliamentary maneuvers, reversals and last-minute amendments. Medicaid now pays for poor women's abortions only if their lives are endangered. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was the first time either chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had expanded eligibility since 1981. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., who championed the move, said it would help `` break the chain and get moving in the other direction'' after years of restrictive federal abortion regulations As approved on the floor, the provision requires prompt reporting of the rape or incest incident in order for a victim to qualify for federal funds. It also gives state legislatures authority to adopt less liberal funding schemes. `` I sincerely believe this amendment reflects the middle ground ... protects the maximum number of lives,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., who offered the modified floor amendment The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does not expand eligibility for Medicaid abortions beyond what is permitted in current law. That difference and others will be resolved in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> has said presidential advisers would recommend a veto of the entire apropriations bill _ which would keep the three agencies in business after the new fiscal year starts Oct. 1 _ over the Medicaid expansion. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said he agreed to the Exon modifications because they gave his provision a better chance of surviving conference. As far as a possible veto, he predicted that `` considering everything else that's in the bill and that it's an election year, it could be overridden.'' The massive appropriations bill, which includes $ 1.2 billion for AIDS research, education, prevention and treatment, drew numerous amendments on family planning, abortion and AIDS. In several instances the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> first rebuffed and then accepted amendments on controversial subjects. Senators earlier in the week rejected attempts to eliminate and restrict the federal family planning program for low-income women. On Wednesday they voted against a ban on federal money for school clinics that distribute contraceptives, then later approved the ban for school clinics that provide abortion counseling or referral services. They also rejected several attempts to renew a ban on federal money for AIDS education material that encourages or promotes homosexuality, then approved two amendments that sent conflicting messages on the same subject. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the AIDS education restrictions last year, failed several times to extend them on Wednesday. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later embraced an amendment that not only contains the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions but also says federally funded AIDs materials can not `` use words stating that homosexuality is ` normal,' ` natural' or ` healthy.''' Lawmakers voted 82-15 not to kill it and then approved it by voice vote. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> called the amendment, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, `` an exercise in bigotry, period. It's about the most objectionable thing I've seen on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor.'' The <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> amendment won approval after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 61-37 for what Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., labeled a pre-emptive strike against the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions The <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> amendment bans federal funds for material that directly promotes or encourages homosexual or heterosexual sexual activity or intravenous drug use, but at the same time says AIDS education programs and materials must provide accurate information on how to avoid AIDS. Some senators who voted for the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions last year said they did not anticipate the chilling effect they would have on the war against AIDS. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said a study by his Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee found that the amendment had delayed program funding, diverted staff time, slowed the distribution of educational materials and prompted some educators to produce material that is less explicit, less risky and less effective. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he initially thought the measure was toothless but `` it is a fact that effective materials have been shelved and vital proposals have been tabled because of the fear of what this amendment might do. In other action Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 48-45 to kill a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment that would have banned federal funds for contraceptives or contraceptive prescriptions issued on school premises. The target was school-based clinics, which receive some Medicaid and block grant money. But later lawmakers approved by voice vote a more limited ban on funds to school-based clinics that provide abortion services.

<HEAD>Defense Concludes Summation at Biaggi Case; Attacks Meese Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s defense lawyer took a final swing at Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in closing arguments at the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption trial Wednesday, calling <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` a crook'' and the case against the congressman `` a frame.'' Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>'s remarks sparked a bitter exchange with prosecutors while the jury was out of the room. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six others are accused of a racketeering conspiracy that turned <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ a now-bankrupt military contractor _ into a cash cow that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts. But a cornerstone of the defense case has been the theory that four corrupt <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives who testified for the government had links to White House insiders like <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and did not need to bribe <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. `` If these four people from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> knew that they had an open door to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>, `` you tell me what they needed <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> for. Extra baggage?'' In his closing argument to the jury last week, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Little sought to defuse the so-called `` Meese defense'' by conceding `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is a sleaze'' but insisting that it had no bearing on <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s alleged crimes. But <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>, the last defense attorney to sum up before the jury, said the case was really about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` Sleaze is not enough. We're talking about a crook. We're talking about a man who today sits in a building with that eagle in front of it,'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said, pointing to the Great Seal above the judge's bench, `` the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> He got promoted for being a crook.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been charged with any wrongdoing but has admitted getting key aides to help <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> win an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contract while he was White House counselor. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was under scrutiny for some time because of his <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> connections, but a special prosecutor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, determined there was insufficient evidence to charge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with wrongdoing. However, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he will leave office later this summer. `` You do n't think <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> wants you to convict <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> asked the jury. `` He'd throw a party if you did.'' At another point he said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> obtained the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contract without <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s help, adding the case against <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> `` is a phony, ladies and gentlemen, it's a frame.'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> also attacked the four cooperating <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials _ <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorten </PERSON> _ as `` vultures'' who `` lived for money.'' All four pleaded guilty to state and federal corruption charges and testified in exchange for leniency. All four also admitted to stealing millions of dollars from the company when they were n't trying to cheat the government or each other Little bitterly protested <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>'s comments about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to the judge during a recess with the jury out of the room. <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> claimed he meant the four cooperating <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> witnesses were framing <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> _ not the prosecution. But the defense attorney stuck to his prediction of a post-conviction celebration by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> created the swindle that led to the indictment,'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said during the exchange, insisting that a <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> conviction `` will take his participation in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> away from the public.'' Little accused <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> of `` poisoning'' the jury's mind and `` leaving them with the impression that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is behind this case.'' `` I will stipulate that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> engaged in improper conduct in connection with this case and I said so in my summation,'' said <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> was hinting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, somehow, was behind <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s indictment. `` Your argument is deceptive,'' <PERSON> Little </PERSON> told <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>, who shot back: `` Maybe you'd also like me to put a bound over my mouth so I wo n't talk. That might also be more helpful to you.'' The prosecution was slated to present its rebuttal argument to the jury Thursday, paving the way later this week for the judge's instruction on the law to jurors and the start of deliberations in the four-month-old trial

Held longest of the 18 is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. `` I intend to do it -LRB- raise the hostage issue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- because I feel that their good offices will be very good for obtaining the release of the hostages,'' the secretary-general told reporters earlier. `` I think they might assert their possible influence in order to have this problem out of the way for both the humanitarian and political business.'' He said the hostages were a `` parallel issue'' to ending the war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has pursued the hostage question previously with Iranians and others. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Tuesday: `` If they -LRB- the Americans -RRB- really want to talk, let them take a non-hostile pose by releasing our assets. If so, we will use our influence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and intercede to solve the problem of hostages.'' In a meeting with reporters Tuesday, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said `` The problem of hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a question relating to the Lebanese. `` It is not our question, but on the basis of humanitarian aspects we will do our best, as we have done till now, and we do hope that all innocent people as hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or anyplace else ... could be released very soon.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Wednesday he believed the secretary-general's `` good offices could help. What was ineffective in the old days may not be so today. Things are moving, things are changing.'' Asked about <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s statement and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said: `` We are not closing the door on anything. We maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail. `` The hostages are ... with us day and night, in our heart and our mind always, and we will do whatever is honorable and decent and wo n't provoke more hostage taking.'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he has visited <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> five times to discuss the matter and `` the important thing for us is to liberate the hostages in such a way that they wo n't be replaced by another group of hostages.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general held separate peace talks with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday on a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insisted that face-to-face negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must precede any truce. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said that he also raised `` very, very specifically'' with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> the issue of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other hostages held by pro-Iranian factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` This is a question on which one has to be very discreet,'' he told reporters after meeting <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> for two hours. `` I raised it very, very specifically.'' He did not disclose the Iranian envoy's response and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> later did not answer questions about the hostages. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief told reporters he thought <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might help on the hostage issue for `` humanitarian and political'' reasons. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met for two hours with Iraqi Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> in the morning and saw <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> in the evening. No substance was disclosed. It was the first full day of separate talks with both adversaries. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> for almost three hours Tuesday. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will not be `` stampeded'' into a settlement. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on direct talks appeared to raise difficulties for agreement on a cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he could not require the belligerents to hold direct talks if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> objects. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> opposes direct talks at this time but left the door open to a request by the secretary-general. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday night he was awaiting answers from both sides on his proposals for implementing a cease-fire and peace plan, mandated by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> one year ago. Some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said problems appeared to be cropping up in the negotiations because of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistent attitude, its military offensive and the use of outlawed chemical warfare. They noted that <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> described as a `` courtesy call'' his official visit with the secretary-general, while <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials described it as `` substantive.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s first responses were `` hopeful proposals.'' No formal meetings were scheduled Thursday. Before <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters Wednesday, he said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insists on face-to-face negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before it will accept a cease-fire. Last Monday <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> abruptly said it would accept a cease-fire after rejecting a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire for one year. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, `` The Iranians know this request from the Iraqi side and I imagine they are considering it.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> did not answer questions on direct talks after his meeting Wednesday night. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` responded very postitively'' to the secretary-general's proposals. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has not disclosed his current proposals for implementing a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and other parts of a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> peace plan adopted in July 1987. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> countered <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s call for direct talks by charging that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was procrastinating and sabotaging <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace efforts He said he lodged a protest with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s purported use of chemical weapons. `` How can we take the Iraqis seriously when ... they are using chemical weapons?'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said to reporters. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said a solution `` can not be done on terms of one side or the other'' and urged both governments to `` help me in finding a solution through compromise.'' On the way into his meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> shall not allow -LRB- itself -RRB- to be stampeded to reach -LRB- a cease-fire -RRB- or to make a hasty step under the present circumstances.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said his government wants `` real peace _ durable and comprehensive,'' but doubts <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intentions. `` We shall seek guarantees and we believe that the first step and the starter for constructive work is face-to-face negotiations between the two parties under the auspices of the secretary-general,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. `` If the Iranians do not accept that formula, that means that they are not sincere about peace.'' Diplomats and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said pressure was mounting on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to soften its position and stop the ground offensive it began after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced on July 18 that it would accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted Resolution 598 soon after the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed it unanimously on July 20, 1987. Resolution 598 provides for a truce, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border skirmishes.

 A pair of `` missing'' newlyweds have turned up alive and well in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, police said Wednesday, 3 -LCB- months after the couple dropped out of sight without a word to relatives or classmates at a suburban Christian college. The father of <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, 22, who eloped with <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, said the couple was `` madly in love'' and disappeared so they could spend time alone together. The bride's parents, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Wednesday afternoon for a reunion later in the day with the couple. `` We just know they are alive and well and very happy and very anxious to see us,'' said <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, who was asked when he arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> if he was upset with his daughter and son-in-law. `` I'm a father. I do n't think they ran from us. `` They ran to something else. They were interested in perfect love ... That's what it appears to be from what we've been able to piece together,'' <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> told reporters. The couple, both students at <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, had eloped a week before they vanished April 2. Their ransacked luxury car was found in an alley in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, its motor still running. The couple were not seen or heard from until they sent letters to their parents and contacted the MacLeans by telephone Tuesday, police Commander <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> said Wednesday. The newlyweds were not at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lindbergh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> on Wednesday afternoon when the MacLeans arrived. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> said they were headed for a private reunion with the couple at a hotel. After the couple vanished, police in three states poured resources into the search, and friends at <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> held prayer vigils, put up posters and questioned people at roadside restaurants and gas stations. `` We're disappointed that they would put people through all that grief, but at the same time, we're glad that they're OK,'' said <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Wheaton </PERSON>, a private, evangelical Christian school. `` We are disheartened that we'd expended so many man-hours,'' said <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>, who headed the investigation. He said police may try to recover the costs of their efforts, but refused to comment further. <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> refused to provide details about the condition or whereabouts of the couple except to say they had called from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area. `` As far as I know, there is no criminal activity involved in the case,'' said <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>. `` Is n't that terrible? Two yuppie zeros costing taxpayers all that money,'' said a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police officer after <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>'s news conference. He refused to give his name. The elder <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> that his daughter and son-in-law would `` touch base'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> later Wednesday. He would n't disclose their whereabouts. `` They were madly in love with each other and I really believed that a significant part of it was that they just wanted to spend time together,'' he said. `` We have n't asked them any particular questions. We're here as mother and dad, really.'' Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s parents, who live in <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, told police Wednesday morning they had heard from the couple, <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s parents were vacationing and may not have heard the news, he said. Telephones went unanswered Wednesday at the homes of both sets of parents and at the <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, home of Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> The search for the couple began when police found their BMW in a downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> alley. Investigators noted that some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance indicated they had planned to vanish. But families and friends were concerned the couple might have come to harm, saying they were too responsible to have gone away without letting loved ones know they were all right. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> said Wednesday that the couple indicated their car was found ransacked apparently because it was stolen after they left it with the keys under the mat. As concern spread, police in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> joined the search. The couple were last seen by Mrs. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> on April 2, the day before Easter, as they left her home. They had said they were having dinner in the city before heading for <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION>, about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Friends told police the couple had been saving money for a trip, and that Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> had bought $ 600 worth of clothes and made entries in her diary about travel. In June, police learned that `` Hidden <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>: The Adventurer's Guide,'' had been checked out March 29 on <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s library card, fueling speculation the couple was missing by choice <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> had been scheduled to graduate in May. Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, a junior, was set to graduate in December.

 Crews set backfires with flame throwers Wednesday to protect Old Faithful from the worst forest fire outbreak at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> National Park this century, while wildfires forced hundreds of people from their homes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, about 1,200 firefighters battled blazes that burned about 1.3 million acres, an area larger than the state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, and strong winds fanned two of the largest fires, officials said. Large fires also burned in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> flew by helicopter over 10,000 charred acres in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s southern areas and told 500 firefighters that he supports the policy of letting naturally caused wildfires burn unchecked in wilderness areas unless they endanger buildings, people or roads. The so-called prescribed fires are believed to eliminate dead and diseased timber and stimulate new growth. `` We are n't going to waste our resources where fires are n't doing harm to the park,'' he said `` There is a long-term beneficial effect from fire.'' Later, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> appeared to hint at a more aggressive stance because of the dry conditions in the area. `` The problem is to decide when you have a prescribed burn or when you have a fire you want to fight,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` In the dry conditions, they're taking the view that any fire that begins they will try to fight it.'' But <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Clary </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> assistant superintendent, said park officials largely will follow the existing policy on natural fires. `` We'll evaluate each one,'' he said. `` If it's one log and you do n't want it to go anywhere else, you do n't want to waste the effort and the manpower. But if it's in the middle of the forest and has the potential, we certainly do n't need to have additional fronts to work on at this point.'' Crews took an active role against a 9,700-acre fire burning within six miles of Old Faithful, the park's most famous attraction. Firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters started backfires in meadows to direct the blaze away from the geyser and nearby structures. They hope the backfires will exhaust fuel ahead of the fire's eastern and northeastern edges and prevent it from spreading to Old Faithful. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a fire information officer at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, said 1,000 acres had been burned intentionally by Wednesday evening and firefighters were optimistic that the tactic would succeed. `` While we have n't had a chance to evaluate it, we are being told it is going as planned and people seem very upbeat on what is going on out there,'' he said. Three pumper trucks were parked at Old Faithful to provide fire protection if necessary. In all, about 83,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres have been blackened by fires. An unusually hot, dry summer has left <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> parched. `` The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the late 1800s,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplinger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official coordinating firefighting. Arson was blamed for a forest fire that burned 2,000 acres outside <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, destroyed at least seven houses and forced the evacuation of over 2,000 people, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> of the state Division of Forestry. The blaze also burned four vehicles and 15 outbuildings, including garages, sheds and barns. An estimated 575 firefighters had the blaze 70 percent contained earlier Wednesday, but winds fanned the flames and reduced the containment figure to 50 percent. One firefighter suffered a burned neck and a resident suffered smoke inhalation. Another person was hurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident. Fire incident commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said the blaze, which was first reported Tuesday afternoon, may have been started by the arsonist who is believed to have started about 50 fires since May. `` Whoever's doing is, they could burn down half of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> if they want,'' <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said. A 1,700-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> forced two dozen people from their homes about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> and crept toward about 50 homes, but officials said the structures were not threatened. About 130 firefighters got a hand from two helicopters toting water buckets and four air tankers that strafed the flames with retardant. Fire officials imposed strict fire restrictions beginning Friday throughout drought-parched <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> south of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Until we see a major break in the weather, these restrictions will hopefully minimize new fire starts which could very quickly threaten life, property and high value resources with potentially catastrophic results,'' said, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, branch chief for fire management in the <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest fire, 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Livengood </LOCATION> in the state's interior, was pushed by winds and grew to 409,000 acres, said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The fire has been burning since early June. Most of the fires in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were burning in remote areas and were allowed to burn because they posed no threat to people or property. A fire northeast of Mount Rainier National Park in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state quickly spread across 1,200 acres in steep terrain, fanned by wind and temperatures near 90. More than 800 firefighters battled the blaze, which closed part of the transcontinental <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION> and a highway. A timely rainstorm and the labors of up to 700 firefighters contained a 5-day-old, fireworks-caused fire that blackened 1,955 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Flaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gorge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, officials said. Firefighters also contained a lightning-sparked wildfire that burned an estimated 3,400 acres of remote terrain in northwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Company Says It Will Pay Fines to Settle Safety Citations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has agreed to pay an $ 873,220 fine for hundreds of alleged safety violations at its strike-torn paper mill here. The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> initially proposed fines totalling $ 1.3 million but later downgraded some of its citations for safety violations and reduced the fines, said IP spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. IP promised not to contest the citations, to pay the fines by Aug. 15 and to correct any remaining violations, but it did not admit any wrongdoing, company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials did not comment on the settlement. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the agency would announce its findings Thursday. `` In those instances where safety deficiencies were brought to our attention, we moved swiftly to correct them,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the mill's resident manager, said in a prepared statement. `` In fact, an overhwleming majority of the items cited by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> have already been corrected.'' `` We will continue to do everything possible to ensure we are in compliance with all state and federal regulations as the safety of our employees is our highest priority,'' he added. Spokesmen for unions representing more than 1,200 IP workers who have been on strike since June 1987 said they would not comment until Thursday. The company has continued to run the mill with what it says are permanent replacement workers. The unions went on strike over wages but subsequently have sought to publicize the alleged safety violations. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to downgrade the severity of citations previously categorized as `` willful'' to `` serious.'' The settlement covers 197 citations for about 1,000 individual violations found during <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspections in January and June, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. That includes 29 citations previously classified as `` willful,'' 122 in the less severe `` serious'' category, 14 `` repeat'' citations and 32 listed as `` other.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the violations were similar to those cited in a preliminary list released earlier by the striking unions. That list cited such things as flammable liquids stored in unapproved containers, fire extinguishers that were improperly discharged, unguarded fan blades and oxygen stored with fuel gas. The company is appealing a $ 242,000 fine levied by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> last October for a separate series of safety violations.

 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told fellow Cubans to get ready to welcome troops home from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> because a settlement is near in the 13-year Angolan civil war. `` We really are on the threshhold of a political solution,'' he said Tuesday in a three-hour speech marking the 35th anniversary of the start of the revolution that overthrew right-wing dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also said Soviet-style economic and political reforms are not in store for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which he said is improving its economic performance through greater worker discipline. The revolutionary leader said Cuban troops can now leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> because they have been victorious on the battlefield but will remain `` until the last minute'' _ when a peace agreement is signed. `` It ca n't be abrupt,'' he said. `` If the agreement is achieved, if the agreement is signed, we will proceed to the total withdrawal of the internationalist force from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.''

 The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent annual pace from April through June, but rising food, energy and clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 4.7 percent, its highest level in almost six years, the government reported Wednesday. Some private economists worried that the big jump in inflation was signaling the concluding stages of the current long economic recovery and could well result in a recession some time next year. The White House dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary deviation. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the growth rate in the gross national product, the economy's total output of goods and services, was down only slightly from a revised 3.4 percent increase in the first three months of the year.

<HEAD>In Eighty-Eight, Ky., This Is The Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 EIGHTY-EIGHT, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ It's'88 in Eighty-Eight, and people are getting ready to celebrate the odd convergence of a point in time and a pinpoint on the map. The last time Eighty-Eight entered the spotlight was when voters here cast 88 votes for President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and 88 votes for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. That earned the town a feature in `` <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>'s Believe It or Not.'' Four decades later, this is the year for Eighty-Eight to call attention to itself again. `` The townspeople have really got excited about it,'' said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, owner of the 88 Market and the driving force behind The Eighty-Eight Celebration set for Sunday. `` That's on the eve of the big day,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, referring to Aug. 8 _ or 8-8-88. There will be a parade, an antique car show, gospel singing, and arts and crafts offerings. The celebration includes a reunion for all who attended the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Eighty-Eight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and a special invitation is going out to anyone 88 years old. It's doubtful there's ever been anything like it in Eighty-Eight, a picture-postcard village with the market, a tire company, neat little houses lining a two-lane road and a red brick church anchoring the town at each end. The first hint that Eighty-Eight's time had come was back in January when collectors sent their New Year's cards to receive the town's postmark. One collector enclosed a note: `` This is your year.'' Until then, `` I had n't even thought about it,'' said postmistress <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>. Soon, all manner of mail, including about 200 graduation announcements from students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, began arriving for cancellation at Mrs. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>'s cubbyhole post office inside Ms. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>'s store `` I'm happy that they're recognizing us,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, 57, who had to make a concession to the town's sudden vogue. After 31 years of hand-canceling mail, she was trading her ink pad and rubber stamp for a self-inking postmarker. The town attracted other attention as well. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of Bowling <PERSON> Green </PERSON> decided to get married here, and the Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, who performed the ceremony, recalled the couple was quite specific about the time: 4:28 p.m. on 4-28-88 in Eighty-Eight. `` It was just sentimental,'' said the new Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. When the marriage license was filed, she added, `` the clerk's office thought the minister put the date where you put the place.'' Eighty-Eight's 200 or so residents were at first loath to make a fuss but finally yielded to the times. Serious planning for a commemoration got under way in a town meeting in June at the 88 Market, which is something of an unofficial community center. And Ms. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, whose store already sold everything from baby food to country hams, has added a special line of merchandise for the occasion: Eighty-Eight caps and T-shirts. `` They've been going like hotcakes,'' she said. The first T-shirt was ceremonially presented to local resident <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON>, age 88. How did the town get its numerical name? The explanation given by some is that it lies 8.8 miles east of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Barren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat. That's not it, says <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an Eighty-Eight native and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> attorney who says he has the authoritative account. It begins with <PERSON> Dabnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON>, who opened a general store and stagecoach stop here around 1850 and became the first postmaster sometime in the late 1860s. Needing a name for the place, <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON> opted for a number because `` his figures were more legible'' than his handwriting, said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON>'s great-great-grandson. To pick the number, <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON> counted the money in his pocket _ 88 cents. `` That's the correct version, according to all the older people in the family who told me,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. At some point _ just when is n't clear _ the town's name was officially spelled out. But mail still arrives here sometimes addressed to `` 88, Ky.''

 `` Kids, we just ca n't afford to buy this. We do n't have enough money right now.'' `` But mom, why do n't we go to the bank machine and get some more?'' If you're a parent of small children, that sort of exchange most likely sounds familiar. One of the innumerable tasks of rearing your offspring in this capitalistic society is to teach them about money. It's a complex subject, of course, intermingling facts with personal styles and values. It can hardly be taught in a single lesson. And as in many other basic elements of life, children are likely to gain much of their understanding of money by observing what their parents do, rather than by listening to what they say. Nevertheless, professional advisers on matters of personal finance say, there are strategies and tools available to help in the process of teaching about money. For instance, suggests the <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the back-to-school shopping parents and children do over the next few weeks can provide a chance to make some points about money management. `` Shopping can teach children about making choices and separating needs from wants,'' the trade group says. `` Start by making a wish list. Then set priorities. Show children that if you shop without a plan, you're likely to run out of money before you've bought everything you need. `` Next talk about alternatives. Is it better to buy several moderately priced items or fewer, more expensive items? Will buying one item mean you ca n't buy another, or that you'll perhaps have to wait to buy the other? `` After you make the purchases, help your child evaluate them. For example, you might ask, ` Would you buy the item again? Did it work the way you thought it would?''' On a broader scale, what is the best way to teach children what money is, how it works and and what it can _ and can not _ do? These days, schools are devoting increased time and resources to the subject. Extensive learning material, some of it even in comic-book form, is produced by the various <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks around the country. For information about how to get this material, most of which is available at no charge when requested in single quantities, you can write or telephone your nerest Federal Reserve bank or branch. <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, the Boston-based mutual fund and discount brokerage firm, offers a teaching kit titled `` You and Money'' free to parents. It can be ordered by telephoning 1-800-544-6666 -LRB- in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, 617-523-1919 collect -RRB-. <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyvers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, offers assurances that callers will not encounter sales pitches for the company's products or be inundated with subsequent mailings of promotional material. The kit, which employs such devices as crossword puzzles and word search grids, stresses these points: _ Money is an essential resource that gives people decision-making opportunities _ Money is not only earned by working, but also by investing _ Economics is the science of how people produce goods and services, how they distribute them and how they use them _ To achieve financial goals, planning and investing are essential However they go about it, parents who try to teach their children about money may get an unexpected dividend that often comes to those in the role of instructor: They may learn a few things themselves.

 You can always worry about inflation. If it is n't present in fact, it is as a threat. And while the threat might be small, it is always magnified by the number of worriers, which is great. Inflation today is both a presence and a threat. As a presence, it is relatively minor, running at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the past year. Relord, however; relative to the double-digit rates of the 1970s, 4 percent is indeed small. But even at 4 percent a lot of damage can be done. At 4 percent, for example, ative is a big wa 7 percent savings account earns only 3 percent in real terms, but the tax is applied as if it were 7 percent. A savings account, by whatever name it is known, therefore becomes mainly a financial technique for staying afloat rather than getting ahead. Four percent inflation cuts your dollar in half within 18 years. Add in taxes, which are always applied to inflated rather than constant dollars, and the time shrinks. Meanwhile, the cost of things you save for, such as an education for your kids or your own retirement, may have their own private inflation rate. Health care inflation, for example, sometimes runs double the overall rate. So is 4 percent damaging? It is, if it persists. It is insidious as tance Art Merges and Emerges at Summer Festival

 It's been more than 50 years since modern dance pioneers <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> defiantly kicked off their toe shoes and whirled in bare feet for a tiny <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> college audience. The revolt against the rigid parameters of ballet that characterized the movement's earliest days has faded. Indeed, ballet itself has lost much of its formality over the past four decades largely due to the late <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> and his influence on other choreographers. `` The war is over,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON>, director of the American Dance Festival. `` The ballet world is more and more turning to modern choreographers for their creative work. `` We need each other, there's no doubt about that.'' The proof was in the line-up for the recent six-week festival on the forested campus of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ the nation's dance capital _ the annual event is considered the mecca of modern dance. Virtually every major name associated with modern dance _ from <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> _ has studied, taught or performed at the festival. More than 300 new works have premiered here, more than 100 of them since 1969, when <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON> took over. And thousands of dance students _ including <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> _ have studied here. At this year's festival, choreographers known for their collaboration with big-name ballet companies, such as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lubovitch </ORGANIZATION>, mixed with experimental and sometimes bizarre talent. `` When I hear, ` That is n't dance,' that's when I sit up and take a look,'' <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON> said in an interview. Some of his `` far-out'' proteges, such as <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON>, have gone on to become darlings of the modern dance world. <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> was recently named resident choreographer at American Ballet Theatre. This year's event devoted two weeks to revivals of black American composers' works _ including <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Primus </PERSON>' `` Strange Fruit'' of 1943, an eerie portrayal of a white woman who has just witnessed a lynching; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McKayle </PERSON>'s `` Games,'' a dance set to the chanting of black ghetto children playing a street game; and works by <PERSON> Talley </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomare </PERSON>. The festival also showcased 26 choreographers from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who traded ideas and styles from their own cultures as part of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choreographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>, co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have to help to interchange -LRB- dance styles -RRB-, because the world is dying,'' said visiting choreographer <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Urzua </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The world's only festival devoted to modern dance was born in 1934 at <ORGANIZATION> Bennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON>, fed up with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> summer heat and the constraints of classical ballet, headed for the cool <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> climate to encourage each other and to start the revolution. They danced in bare feet, gained weight and practiced movements while lying or sitting on the ground _ all antithetical to the ethereal world of ballet. They also taught students in order to support themselves, and at the end of the six-week session performed only for each other on the campus. The festival moved to <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1948. In 1959, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> choreographed `` Episodes'' with <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, using <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> as a solo dancer. `` That was the beginning of the coming-together, choreographically, of the two worlds,'' <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON> said. Since moving to <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, the festival has continued its cautious partnership with classical ballet, while maintaining the endless battle for funding. Raising money to support the festival _ $ 1.75 million for this year's operating budget _ is a year-round operation for <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, and two staff members at <ORGANIZATION> ADF </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. About 45 percent comes from festival tuition and ticket sales, with the rest gathered from private corporations, foundations and individual dance lovers, as well as local governments, <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON> said. With funding uncertain, the festival's trappings are modest. An old white frame house shaded by crepe myrtle trees on <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s East campus serves as summer headquarters. More than 300 dancers attend classes and perform in converted classrooms and gymnasiums around the university _ most of which lack air-conditioning to ward off the stifling <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> heat. In a sweltering gymnasium, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a diminutive blonde in her 60s who helped found the <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Limon </PERSON> dance troupe, called out instructions to about 30 muscular men and women in leotards. Outside on the campus lawn, more than three dozen dancers in <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' African American Dance class hopped frenetically and sang the words to an African folk song, while drummers played African rhythms. In a makeshift studio off the university's student union cafeteria, the sound of clattering dishes competed with a jazz dance recording. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, a 34-year-old dancer from <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, tried to absorb it all. `` It's live, breathe and work dance, every hour of the day and night,'' she said. `` I love it.''

 When creator <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddenberry </PERSON> has a question about `` Star Trek'' the man he turns to is <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. The information about `` Star Trek,'' and the lore amassed over the past 22 years, is so vast that only the most dedicated Trekkie could possibly keep track of it. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> has been the show's official archivist at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> for the past two years, but for nearly nine years before that he was an unpaid but virtually full-time consultant. `` I might get a call from a game show asking which cast member first said, ` Beam me up, <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON>,''' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. `` No one ever said that on any ` Star Trek' episode. The fans made it up, like ` Play it again, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.' `` I frequently get calls from merchandising and licensing. They'll want to know what actor played such-and-such a character and how can they get hold of him to sign a waiver. Television stations call a lot asking for help in designing a promotion campaign.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> emphasized, however, that he is not the final word on the show. `` I'm a consultant,'' he said. `` I'm not hanging over anyone's shoulders. They can consult me or not.'' `` Star Trek'' made its debut on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and ran for three years. It has also been an animated series, four hit motion pictures have been made and a fifth is in the works, and the new TV series `` Star Trek: The Next Generation'' is an enormous hit in syndication. `` I was 12 years old when ` Star Trek' began,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. `` I'd gone through ` The Hardy Boys,' even my sisters' ` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>' books, and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> had gotten me into science fiction I remember I spent one summer in a tent in the backyard reading. My mother thought there was something wrong with that. `` On TV I'd watched ` Lost in Space,' ` Voyage To the Bottom of the Sea,' and ` Time Tunnel.' Then ` Star Trek' came on. The first episode intrigued me. The next episode was so good, I cried at the end. After that I scheduled my life around watching ` Star Trek.' I watched the shows over and over and over again. My mother could n't understand that I asked her if she ever went back to the same restaurant.'' His mother, incidentally, finally began watching and was soon an avid `` Star Trek'' fan herself. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, who was born in the same hospital in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doohan </PERSON> -LRB- Scotty -RRB-, ran a `` Star Trek'' fan club in high school and college. He moved from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in 1969 and went to his first science fiction convention with a cousin in downtown <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` It changed my whole life,'' he said. `` I went to the first ` Star Trek' convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1971. I met <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddenberry </PERSON> there and he was very kind to me. But I did n't know who he was until he was introduced at the convention.'' That was the first of many `` Star Trek'' conventions he was to attend in following years. In 1974 he moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to work as a hospital orderly. `` I still kept in touch with everybody, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON>'s assistant, began calling me for information,'' he said. `` She knew my memory of the shows. If there was a question or a problem they'd call me. Eventually, it got to the point where I had an office, a parking space and my name in the Paramount studio directory. And I was n't even on the payroll. `` I kept getting more and more calls. From publicity, from merchandising, from everybody. I was spending nearly all my time at the studio. Finally, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> proposed establishment of the job of archivist and I went to work on July 1, 1986.'' It's a job that you'd think would make <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> the envy of every Trekkie. But <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said they're such a compatible group that they help each other out. He frequently calls on other Trekkies when he's stumped. `` I'll call <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Tathwell </PERSON> if I need to know dialogue from the first 79 episodes or the movies,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> knows all about the toys and memorabilia. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vardaman </PERSON>, who works on the new series as a stand-in, knows the dialogue better than I do. And he's worked with a lot of the guest stars.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> also turns out the best-selling `` Star Trek'' calendars for Pocket Books. Next up is the fifth `` Star Trek'' movie, which was postponed when <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON> accepted an offer from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> to direct <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> in `` The Good Mother.'' The tentative start date for `` Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' is Sept. 12. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> will direct. <PERSON> Harve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will produce. `` I think they'll keep making the movies as long as the original seven cast members want to,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> is becoming very hot as a director and that could affect his availability. It's such an ensemble cast that if one actor was lost for any reason I do n't know if the other actors would want to go on or how the fans would accept it.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After half a century in the grip of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> and his family, the long-ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has a new leadership that hopes to steer <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from the authoritarian and uncompromising ways of its past. The changes at the top and in direction came at the party's recent 13th congress in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> Ever since the government of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> was driven to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949 by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s Communists, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or Kuomintang, has been consumed by an undying dream of returning to govern the world's most populous nation. While the congress vowed to keep that dream alive, it cautiously acknowledged the need to replace its aging party elders who date from the Chiang days on the mainland to a more dynamic leadership aware of the need for democratic change at home and pragmatism in dealing with mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The new thinking comes as the mainland Chinese have been making radical changes of their own, including overtures to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for a one-nation, two-systems type of arrangement they made with the British on capitalist <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s new leadership unveiled at the congress clearly showed power is shifting to native Taiwanese, who constitute 85 percent of this prosperous island's nearly 20 million people. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> was acclaimed the first native Taiwanese leader of the party. That helped consolidate his power base that was virtually non-existent when he succeeded <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, the eldest son of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, as head of government upon his death in January. The elder <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, who was elected head of the party in 1938, died in 1975. The party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, long dominated by mainland Chinese, for the first time has a native Taiwanese majority. Giving more power to native Taiwanese was part of a sweeping liberalization program that began with <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, the final ruler of the <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> family dynasty. Shortly before his death, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-Kuo </PERSON> lifted martial law, allowed the formation of opposition political parties and ended a 38-year ban on travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to allow family reunions. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has promised to continue the liberalization process but may proceed with caution since his new 31-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> still contains some party elders who remain unenthusiastic about a quick pace of change. `` We do n't believe drastic change will benefit society,'' the party's 38-year-old deputy-secretary general, <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ying-jeou </PERSON>, told reporters at the end of the congress. The major unresolved political issue is overhauling the parliamentary system in which aging Nationalists elected in mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before 1949 hold a majority of seats as a symbol of the party's claim to rule the country. In the Legislative Yuan, the highest lawmaking body, the Old Guard has an advantage of about 2-to-1 over Taiwan-elected legislators. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> said that through retirement of party elders and an increase in the number of seats contested on the island, the ratio of holdovers to Taiwan-elected lawmakers should be about equal after elections in late 1989. After another three years, Taiwan-elected representatives should hold a 2-to-1 edge, he said. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, however, has staged street demonstrations in support of opening all seats to elections, actions that elicited expressions of caution from the Nationalists on the need to maintain law and order. Under pressure from the new generation of leaders, the party congress adopted a more practical approach to dealing with the mainland. Ma described the new policy as providing `` much more flexibility to what we had been doing before.'' The Kuomintang, which once sent ballons across the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> with handbills urging an uprising against `` Communist bandits,'' now will try to influence their compatriots by taking the `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> experience'' of economic prosperity and growing democracy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The ban on travel to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also has been eased. The Nationalists also will tolerate imports of Chinese raw material and the export of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> investment to the mainland so long as the business is conducted through a third country. `` There is no way we can control indirect investment, as well as indirect trade,'' Ma said. The point of the new flexibility, according to the policy statement, is `` to utilize our political and economic influence to win the support of our mainland compatriots.'' The changing face of the Kuomintang prompted a leading member of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s opposition party to acknowledge the ruling party's new dynamism. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Huang-hsiung </PERSON>, a lawmaker from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that his party `` is facing a new challenge from the restructured Kuomintang.'' `` But I believe the condition is better for democratization now,'' he said. `` We can better pressure them to compete with us on equal footing.''

<HEAD>Author Alice Hoffman Talks About `That AIDS Novel'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> calls `` At Risk,'' her seventh work of fiction, `` another very small domestic book.'' Everybody else in the publishing industry is calling it `` that AIDS novel.'' Even before publication, 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> snapped up the film rights to `` that AIDS novel'' and the Book-of-the-Month Club made it a Main Selection. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s publisher, G.P. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON>'s Sons, has run off a first printing of 100,000 copies and is spending $ 100,000 to promote `` At Risk'' _ the kind of publicity campaign usually reserved for authors who trade bon mots on the talk show circuit or write diet and exercise books. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was recently in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss `` At Risk,'' acquired immune deficiency syndrome and why such topical subject matter is often considered the kiss of death for so-called `` literary fiction.'' `` I think some critics, for reasons I do n't truly understand, feel that a writer should n't write about something that's topical _ that there's news and there's literature, and the two have nothing to do with each other,'' said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, whose `` Illumination Night,'' `` Fortune's Daughter'' and other works have firmly established her as a `` serious'' writer. `` I think that I always write about issues. ` White Horses' -LRB- her fourth novel -RRB- is about incest; my last book -LRB- ` Illumination Night' -RRB- is about agoraphobia,'' she said. `` I think it just so happens that what I was obsessed with was what a lot of other people are obsessed with. I think that's why ` At Risk' is getting more of a reaction than anything I've done before. `` I really wrote it for myself; I really thought it was this very small domestic book. ... It seems to me amazing that there are n't more books about AIDS, because I think there are so many different stories to tell.'' The story <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> has chosen to tell is of the <ORGANIZATION> Farrells </ORGANIZATION>, a painstakingly normal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> family whose world collapses with the discovery that 11-year-old <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> has contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion. While she battles ostracism from her classmates and struggles for small victories in gym meets, her parents, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>, retreat from one another and her 8-year-old brother, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, languishes from neglect. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was asked why she opted to have a character get the disease through a blood transfusion, a rare occurrence even before blood was routinely screened for AIDS. `` I wrote about the thing I know the best, the thing that I'm most enmeshed in right now, and that's family life,'' said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> who has two sons, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 4 months `` I imagined how I would feel if my kid was in school with somebody with AIDS, especially at the preschool level. I felt fearful. I knew it was irrational; I knew it made no sense, and in a way this book was a personal way of working that out.'' She said her approach highlights the universality of the AIDS problem by giving the disease to a child instead of to a homosexual male. `` AIDS is not a gay disease and to look at it that way is very dangerous and really destructive,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. Writing a book in which a central character suffers from a fatal disease smacks of potboilerdom, but <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s rich and imagistic prose saves `` At Risk'' from becoming maudlin. She was asked if she found herself fighting sentimentality. `` I do n't think I fight sentimentality,'' she said quickly, laughing. `` I do n't think I'm sentimental, but I'm definitely emotional. I think sometimes those two things are thought of as the same thing. I also think that a lot of times what women are sometimes more interested in is thought of as sentimental, as less important _ things like families and children, emotional entanglements, that kind of thing.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 36, grew up on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Adelphi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before earning her master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s prestigious creative writing program. She has been writing and publishing steadily since then, living in `` a big old falling-down house'' outside of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with her husband and two children. Since moving to that area about eight years ago, she has written one or two screenplays a year. Only one has been made into a commercially released film -LRB- `` Independence Day'' -RRB-, but the pay is still lucrative enough that her husband, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, quit his teaching job to work at home with her on the projects. She has already completed the screenplay for `` At Risk,'' although production has not begun on it. The writer's strike has idled her screenwriting for now, and she has not started work on her next novel. What, then, is she working on these days? She smiled. `` Birth announcements.''

<HEAD>Differences Persist Over Document That Shook Catholicism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A papal edict that caused an upheaval in Roman Catholicism was commemorated this week. American bishops saluted it for `` prophetic wisdom,'' but recognized obstacles to it. The occasion was the 20th anniversary of the late Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>'s 1968 encyclical `` Humanae Vitae,'' `` Of Human Life,'' which reaffirmed the church's ban on contraception, and set off a church storm Repercussions still linger in the widescale Catholic rejection of the particular prohibition and, as seen by some scholars, in the spread of dissent to other areas of church teaching. In this country and elsewhere, the event catalyzed a searching examination of Catholic rights of conscience, and debate over it still goes on. The enclyclical, asserting an inseparable link between the unifying and reproductive dimensions of sexual intercourse, said it always `` must remain open to the transmission of life.'' Despite continuing resistance to the rule, bishops and some <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> groups paid tribute to it. Also, a new study gave a positive assessment of the church's only approved way of limiting pregnancies _ natural family planning. This involves charting the wife's period of fertility and avoiding intercourse during it. In responses from 3,763 couples using the method, 70 percent found it satisfactory. `` The results verify that couples who are properly instructed and well-disposed find natural methods satisfactory and effective,'' said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, head of the bishops' pro-life committee. It was the first such nationwide study of its kind, with answers to questionnaires gathered from couples instructed in the use of natural methods in 24 diocesan programs across the country. The study, funded by the Knights of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, a national <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> fraternal organization, found that two-thirds of the husbands and wives consider it important to be `` in conformity with church teaching'' in their sex lives. Only about 10 percent reported unintended pregnancies in the past year. `` The results are highly encouraging,'' said Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, director of the church's Diocesan Development Program for Natural Family Planning. However, as indicated by numerous surveys over the past decade, large majorities of Catholics, generally found at more than 70 percent and ranging up to 90 percent, disagree with the church's ban on contraception That situation, multiplying into dissent on other church fronts, burst widely after the promulgation on July 29, 1968, of `` Humanae Vitae.'' It generated public dissent from about 650 American <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theologians, including most of some faculties, and created prolonged turmoil in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between priests and the late Cardinal <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. Several national hierarchies _ in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elswhere _ affirmed conscientious decisons about the issue _ similar to a 1971 <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> compromise settling the dispute in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, in the early phases of the outcry, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops in 1968 issued a statement recognizing rights of responsible theological dissent. But in 1986 this was repudiated as `` unworkable'' by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Archbishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, now cardinal-designate, after the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> barred the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, a noted moral theologian, from teaching theology. He dissented from various church sexual teachings, including bans on contraception and divorce. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>'s controversial encyclical came in the wake of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, from which he had removed the issue. To study it, he set up a broad commission of scientitific and religious scholars. Its strong majority recommended dropping the contraception ban, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s reassertion of it hit like a thunderclap. He attributed resulting difficulties largely to `` a certain climate of expectation which had given rise, among Catholics and in the wider circle of public opinion, to the idea of presumed concessions ...'' Twenty years later, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities said `` we see ever more clearly the prophetic wisdom'' of the church's position and `` the courage of Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> in reaffirming'' it. At the time he did so, they said, the birth-control pill was relatively new and people `` were still reeling from the ` sexual revolution' of the 1960's ... Today's climate is different again. `` Looking back over the past 20 years ..., we can see a gradual decline in family size and an increase in divorce, both notably pronounced among Catholics, and an overwhelming assault on the sacredness of human life in judicial decisions and social policies regarding abortion. `` We find in our society a growing ambivalence regarding children, and an increasing tendency to equate the bond of marriage with mere cohabitation.'' Against these tendencies, the bishops said, adherence to the church's teaching against contraception helps married couples develop sensitivities to each other's needs that `` solidify the marriage relationship. `` Efforts to live their sexuality in accord with the teaching of the church brings to married couples peace of mind and conscience. It also deepens their faith and affirms their reliance on God's providential care ...

The evangelical fortnightly, Christianity Today, says responses from 401 of 749 subscribers surveyed found that 74 percent want creationism taught along with evolution in public schools, and 82 percent favor voluntary school prayer. Seventy-six percent support a constitutional amendment banning abortion except to save the life of the mother, and 86 percent oppose school-based health clincis that distribute contraceptives.

Little tiny, short films,'' he said. `` All those films usually centered around one person who is on the outside and starts getting involved in some over-ambituous thing to get ahead and winds up creating a chain reaction.'' `` Midnight Run'' is <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>'s fourth feature film. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> stars as a bounty hunter who will collect $ 100,000 from his bondsman if he can bring a bail-jumping accountant from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> is going to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> by plane but changes his plans when the accountant -LRB- <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON> -RRB- reveals his fear of flying. The two instead travel by car, bus, passenger train and box car, pursued by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, local police, a fellow bounty hunter and the Mafia, from whom <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON> took $ 15 million and donated to charity. <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> and screenwriter <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> created the story. `` We were just hanging around talking and he told me about a friend of his that had to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to pick up a prisoner and after he got the prisoner on a plane, the guy went nuts and could n't fly,'' <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> recalled. `` They had to come across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with different types of transportation.'' The film required extensive location work, a process that took its toll on the crew. `` Each day the crew is presented with an entirely new set of problems,'' he said. `` Each time we got to new a place, by the time we knew the problems and how to deal with them, we had to move to another place. `` Our camera crew quit, our assistant director crew quit. It was a difficult production.'' But <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> had more than enough to be thankful for while making `` Midnight Run,'' starting with the actors. `` It never occurred to me in a million years that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> would want to do my movie,'' said <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>, still shaking his head in amazement. `` I could n't believe it.'' He recalled one scene in `` Midnight Run'' in which <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> visits his ex-wife in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and asks for money. `` He asks her what her new husband will think about her giving him money and she just says, ` It'll be OK; he'll understand.' He says, ` Well, that's love.' When he says it, his spine just kind of collapsed. His posture just collapses in the subtlest way. `` I ca n't picture him thinking, ` Well, when this line comes up, I'll just collapse my spine.' It's just so in character that it happened and it's so subtle and so powerful that you think, ` Where did this guy think of that?' `` That's genius of the highest order when he's doing apparantly so little.'' `` Genius'' is a word <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> also uses for <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON>, who the director described as `` one of the great deadpan humorists.'' The pairing of the blank-faced <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON> and the intense <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> worked out better than <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> had ever imagined. `` When I told people I was doing this movie with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON>, they thought it was the weirdest combination,'' <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> said. `` Once I saw the two of them together, it was screamingly obvious to me that they were the perfect combination.'' `` Midnight Run'' centers on the love-hate relationship of <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON>, who are endlessly fighting and making up. The bantering between male leads can be found in <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>'s other features as well. `` I think it all has to do with the fact that when I was growing up, the things I used to watch on TV that I enjoyed were Laurel and <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> movies and ` The Honeymooners,''' he said. `` Those are the things that entertain me more than anything. Having them as sort of role models.''

 Step aside noh and kabuki, and make way for the Metropolitan Opera, <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> and `` 42nd Street.'' Those familiar names in such Western culture capitals as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are finding homes in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Japanese people are internationalizing,'' said theater critic <PERSON> Kenichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirahama </PERSON>. `` From the destruction of war, the country has rebuilt itself and now become a glittering show business market.'' The lineup of summer goodies lends weight to the claim, with <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> among the many heavyweights bound for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to appease local hunger pangs for foreign theater. `` It's ` event heaven' here,'' said <PERSON> Shirahama </PERSON>, who has also published several books on Japanese theater. For star performers, a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> engagement usually is more than just stage appearances. Many are given plum TV spots plugging sponsor products in their contracts. `` We even get requests from foreign artists to sponsor them in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Norio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` They've recognized the clout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> holds and the need to succeed here.'' For giant corporations, doubling as sponsors for the eager artists `` is a way of polishing the company name,'' <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON> said, though they rarely make profits because of the astronomical costs and heavy taxes involved. <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breweries </ORGANIZATION> paid dearly when it sponsored a recent Met tour: It picked up a tab of $ 3 million to put the company on stage. But the amount is small compared to the estimated $ 17 million needed to transport <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s 500-member La Scala opera in September. Hefty door prices are inevitable to offset the production costs. But for the yen-strong Japanese, who still buy if the price is high, money is no obstacle. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>'s `` The Mahabharata,'' for example, was sold out months in advance despite the $ 270 ticket price for the nine-hour play. Choice box seats for two were tagged at $ 615 each. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is an affluent society,'' said <PERSON> Toshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuronuma </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` People can afford the high prices for the tickets.'' She also said the Japanese people are no longer satisfied with home productions of opera and ballet and now want to see `` the real thing.'' `` Their tastes have gone up,'' <PERSON> Kuronuma </PERSON> said. Language is also no handicap for the Japanese audience. The shows make sure to cater to every need. During its tour, the second to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but the first in 13 years outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Met projected Japanese subtitles on a small screen above the stage. `` 42nd Street,'' meanwhile, made do with simultaneous interpretation. But `` The Phantom of the Opera'' went one step further and was both translated and adapted for a local theater group, as were other musicals, including `` Cats,'' `` La Cage aux Folles'' and `` Les Miserables.'' As for `` The Greatest Show On Earth,'' which made its international debut last month in northern <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, the singing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ringmaster is pulling in crowds with shouts of `` subarashii zoo-san, okashii piero'' -LRB- `` amazing elephants, strange clowns'' -RRB- _ after a two-month Japanese-language crash course. In order to accommodate the flood of imported productions, concert and theater halls have been sprouting up all over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In less than three years, more than a dozen have opened their doors, while about eight more halls will be inaugurated next year. Probably the most ambitious to date has been the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Globe Theater, a pinkish gray 650-seat structure built at a cost of $ 15.4 million. It was inaugurated with a performance by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in April. Across town, the <PERSON> Casals </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, dedicated to the late cellist <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Casals </PERSON>, opened last December. The sleek, new Suntory Hall was the site for the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>. Seating over 2,000, it was among the first of the modern music halls to open its doors to imported artists two years ago. The rise in foreign theater has definitely influenced interest for new halls. `` It's a good feeling to listen to music in pleasant surroundings,'' <PERSON> Kuronuma </PERSON> said. She dismissed criticisms that the Japanese interest in foreign productions was merely a boom, and said it was even likely to replace noh and kabuki as the major theater form. `` Noh and kabuki appeal to the older generations,'' <PERSON> Kuronuma </PERSON> said, `` but opera, ballet and the like attract a bigger group of people, including the young crowd. `` With them the trend is toward internationalizing.'' Japanese theater, she added, is `` too traditional.''

 Dissident Bishop <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, excommunicated from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the church's first split in 118 years, says <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is wrecking his own job. `` He is like a soft drink seller praying for cold weather,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> says. `` He's going to put himself out of business.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, 48, was ousted from the church at the end of June after he and three others were consecrated bishops by Rebel Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in a ceremony in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> promptly excommunicated him and the four new bishops, provoking the first major schism in the Roman Catholicism since 1870. Also ousted was retired Brazilian <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> who took part in the ceremonies. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> predicted the `` official church in 10 years will almost have disappeared.'' `` The only Catholic church strong will be the Catholics that keep to the complete faith,'' he said. `` For us the future looks bright, but for the mainstream church, people will have gone the modern way and cease to be Catholics.'' <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s traditionalist followers are estimated at 100,000 to 500,000 by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and more than a million by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Econe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, 82, denounces church reforms of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, including its affirmation of religious liberty, ecumenical relations with other Christians and putting the Latin liturgy into modern languages. He charges the church has been `` Protestantized'' and `` democratized.'' He was suspended from functioning in 1976, but defied it and expanded his movement, ordaining more than 200 priests. Consecrating the new bishops brought his ouster and theirs. The British-born <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, ran the rebel movement's <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquinas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION> until it recently moved to <LOCATION> Winona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. He plans to stay in <LOCATION> Rdigefield </LOCATION> to operate a retreat center there. He said Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> `` is not understanding of how to defend the faith in today's world.'' `` For example, the church is to move with the times, but not jump in with the times,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said in an interview at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ignatius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retreat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` If a man with a rope is trying to save a man who is drowning, he should n't jump in with him,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said it does n't bother him that his actions are disapproved by the pope. `` If he was a rootin' and tootin' Catholic pope, I'd be all shook up,'' he said. `` But since he's losing his <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> way, it does n't upset us.'' The excommunications expel <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> and the others from the church and prohibt them from receiving its sacraments. `` This pope on his present course will destroy the papacy,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said, `` but the Catholic church has the guarantee of the Lord that it will survive until the end of time, and part of that is the survival of the papacy.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> has not always been a Catholic, nor has he always had dreams of becoming a priest or bishop. An Anglican, he converted to Catholicism when he was 30 years old. `` I never wanted to be a bishop,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. He added that he was selected by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said he decided to become a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> because, `` I knew the world was going to hell in a hand basket.'' He said he `` the Catholic religion is the only answer.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> says he plans to travel and admister confirmations and ordinations. `` A number of Catholics do n't take this excommunication too seriously,'' he said. He pointed out the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is considered infallible only `` under certain circumstances and outside of those he's not infallible.'' `` The pope has to be speaking as a pope on a matter of faith and morals with the intention of binding the whole church in a definitive or defining fashion.'' he said. `` Outside of those circumstances, he's capable of saying 2 plus 2 is 5.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> also denies the ceremony in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> was a schism. `` A schism means someone was cut off from the church,'' he said. `` We claim to be very much a part of the church.'' In another interview with the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Catholic, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> predicted that <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> will `` come back to tradition'' when God uses the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, who `` are on the brink of invading <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' to chastize the church. The pope, fleeing <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, will then turn to the traditionalists, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. In response to a question, he agreed with <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s charge that the Roman hierarchy is `` doing the work of the anti-Christ.''

 <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> said he wrote `` Tidy Endings'' because he wanted to explore the personality of a man who would fall in love with another man terminally ill with AIDS. The short play picks up the story after <PERSON> Collin </PERSON>'s death as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, his lover, and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, his former wife, bicker over division of the estate. `` Tidy Endings,'' which Home Box Office will cablecast beginning Sunday, was the last segment of <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON>'s `` Safe Sex'' trilogy on Broadway. <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> also stars as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stockard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> is <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>. `` It's a drama about a man who's bitter, lost, hurt and bleeding,'' said <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON>. `` I had a lot of questions about that character. I write to explore personalities. I wanted to look at a man who would fall in love with someone terminally ill. `` This is about how he deals with it There's something very sad about <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>. I think he wants everyone to mourn for him and he's sort of disappointed when people do n't He has a kind of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> Nightingale quality. He gives up his job to care for this man.'' <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> was interviewed during a late-evening break on a location set for the motion picture version of `` Torch Song Trilogy.'' He won two Tonys for writing and starring in the comedy on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. It tells the story of <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckoff </PERSON>, a gay young man and female impersonator whose homosexuality is driving his Jewish mother to distraction. <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> won a third <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> for writing the book of the musical `` La Cage Aux Folles.'' In `` Tidy Endings,'' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> has gone on with her life. But <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> is devastated by the death of <PERSON> Collin </PERSON>. `` She had to give the funeral, write the obituary, and now she's telling <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> to move out of the apartment,'' said <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> `` She has a problem of letting go as well. I thought of them as two vultures fighting over the memory of this dead man. These are two people who should be taking care of each other. They're jealous and neither can trust that <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> could love them both. That's what drew me to the story. `` I think they're both incredible people. I could n't do what either one did. I think they're both heroes, although the death puts them in their worst light.'' In the story that spawned the play, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> does not begin his relationship with <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> until the latter is terminally ill. He also forges a truce of sorts with the young son <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> had with <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> was in his motor home dressing room, which was parked outside a seedy-looking bar standing in for a gay hangout in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He was preparing for a scene in which he meets his lover, played by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON>. He was in the last days of a two-month shooting schedule. `` Torch Song Trilogy'' was written in the worry-free days before AIDS and is played as a period story. The movie also stars <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bancroft </PERSON> as his mother -LRB- <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> of `` The Golden Girls'' played the role on Broadway -RRB-. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> plays the love of his life, who is killed by a street gang hunting for gays. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrodad </PERSON> is his young adopted gay son, and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is the woman <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON> leaves <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> for when he begins to worry about appearances. <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> is both an actor and a writer, but calls himself an artist because he does n't want to be limited. He has a degree in painting from the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I never act again, it's OK,'' he said `` If I never write again, it's OK. Life's too short I always say a murderer is much more forgivable than a person who is boring. `` I had a painting teacher who turned me off painting. I turned to ceramics. I have a house full of ash trays to prove it. In college I was writing and painting and acting all at the same time.'' <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> has also appeared in such movies as `` Garbo Talks,'' `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>,'' `` Dog Day Afternoon,'' the TV movie `` Apology,'' and narrated the award-winning documentary `` The Life and <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION>.'' His well-known foghorn voice has also been heard as Satan in the TV movie `` The Demon Murder Case.'' He bristles at a question suggesting that playing mostly gays might be typecasting. `` You would n't ask <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> if he plays only straight roles,'' he said. `` I'd much rather play a homosexual. I know a lot more about it. I happen to think homosexuality is the norm.'' <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> has also written the book for the musical `` Legs Diamond,'' very loosely based on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gangster. It goes into rehearsal soon with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who wrote the music and lyrics, in the title role. `` This has almost nothing to do with the real Legs,'' he explained. `` We are not glamorizing gangsters. We are glamorizing show business.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> preparing for several interviews when he picked up a microphone and announced: `` Good Evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s historic <PERSON> Faneuil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> for tonight's segment of ` The Advocates. Our topic tonight: the horrors of the Vietnam War.'' The Democratic presidential nominee was simply making a microphone check, but he also was providing a glimpse back to his days as a television star, of sorts. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had his `` Death Valley Days'' when he was a candidate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has `` The Advocates.'' While no one is comparing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor favorably to `` the Great Communicator'' in terms of television presence, his cool and relaxed manner in TV interviews and campaign debates has been noted. The program <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hosted from 1971 to 1973 and from 1978 to 1980 pitted two teams, usually divided along liberal and conservative lines, against one another to debate topical issues. He had little on-air experience before that, but former executive producer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Harney </PERSON> said, `` He took to it like a duck to water. We spoke to him about looking at that camera lens as if it's your wife. Beyond that, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needed little coaching, <PERSON> Harney </PERSON> said. The 60-minute program, broadcast on public television from <ORGANIZATION> WGBH-TV </ORGANIZATION> studios in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, kept <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> up to date on major issues. Also, it helped him develop skills on television that he would later use successfully as a candidate and a governor. `` It was superb training for him,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barum </PERSON>, a broadcast journalism professor at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who watched <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from close range as an on-air columnist for public broadcasting stations. `` It was n't one of those TV programs where all you did was look at a TelePrompTer,'' Barum said. `` He had to be very fast on his feet and yet be evenly paced.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joined the program after an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor. It was a period of political planning for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, when he was beginning to build the organization that would win him the governorship four years later. Conservative writer <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who appeared on several programs, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' television presence has changed little. `` It was a dry, level performance then and it's a dry level performance now,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> media consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> also appeared on `` The Advocates.'' `` He learned very early on that television is a medium of the economic use of the body and the hands,'' <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to be jumping all over the stage or the screen to get attention. <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said the taped format enabled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to review his own performance on the broadcasts each week and to work slowly to improve. But <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Democratic rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, said that not all of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' experience could be carried over to a campaign `` Some of those dynamics change when you become the total focus rather than the man in the middle,'' <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said. In speeches and debates, he finds <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` a little bit too much under control,'' and he is annoyed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' frequent tucked-in-thumb hand gestures. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took two years to decide whether to seek office again after his failed bid for reelection in 1978. He needed only weeks to decide to go back on the air as moderator of `` The Advocates.'' `` While I regret the circumstances that allow me to be here, it's good to be back,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his audience. He said of his return performance, `` It's amazing how fast you settle back in. ... Being governor did n't hurt.'' The Emmy Award-winning program was presented in a courtroom format. Two teams of `` advocates'' faced off over an issue. Each team had an attorney-like figure and several witnesses. Teams were allowed to cross-examine the opposing witnesses. `` The Advocates'' was one of the most popular offerings on public television, second only to `` Masterpiece Theater'' at the time in the number of public television stations which picked up the program. One Nielsen survey indicated that 3.6 million homes tuned in to at least one broadcast of The Advocates per month in 1971. Throughout the programs on such topics as SALT II, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil, and Vietnamese refugees, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed to side with the audience in almost a Ted Koppel-like role, asking witnesses to explain arcane or technical words in everyday language. He appeared clipped, sober and straightforward, yet his demeanor seemed more relaxed than his typical gubernatorial appearance. At one point during a debate on nuclear power, for example, a witness kept referring to `` quads'' of energy. `` Could you tell us lay people what that is?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. When the response was, `` It's a million billion British thermal units,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> translated, `` It's a lot of power.'' Former network correspondent <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON>, who directs the press and public policy center at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, said the experience seems to have made <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about even in television effectiveness with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his future opponent in the the presidential election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON> said, listens too much to his advisers who would be better to `` let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has a way of clipping off the end of a sentence. His voice runs down and he repeats phrases,'' according to <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON>. `` Neither one is God's gift to television.''

 Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter earnings could benefit from its new series of mainframe computers, which are 25 percent to 50 percent more powerful _ and up to 15 percent more expensive _ than their predecessors. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday unveiled the new machines, which are the latest version of the company's 3090 series that debuted in 1985. The 10 models in the Enterprise System-3090 S series are led by the model 600-S, which <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> called `` the industry's most powerful general purpose processor.'' It has 56 percent more processing power than its preceding model. The new machines range in price from $ 985,000 for the basic 120-S model, which will be available in September, to $ 12.4 million for the most powerful 600-S model, which will be available in the fourth quarter. Analysts said that although the new machines were priced between 10 percent and 15 percent more than preceding models, they welcomed the increase because of the positive effect it would have on overall future earnings. `` In the past <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had been pushing prices down very aggressively while looking for volume to offset -LRB- the increase -RRB-, and they had been disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. But computer users have been more interested in a product's performance `` It appears <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has been getting that message, and this is clear evidence they are focusing more on performance than price,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> gained 25 cents to close at $ 122.62 -LCB- a share in composite trading. While analysts had been predicting strong earnings in the fourth quarter, they said the latest announcement solidified those predictions. Mainframe and peripheral products account for about half of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s total revenue. `` If this announcement had not come, the earnings estimates would have been down dramatically,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The new products had been expected widely in the industry. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe orders had dropped off dramatically in the past few months as customers held off making decisions until the new products were announced. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannavino </PERSON>, vice president and president of the data systems division, said demand for the new series `` will be very strong. We have talked to a lot of customers already, and they are anticipating it.'' He said he expected orders to begin coming in within the next few weeks. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Wladawsky-Berger </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s data systems division, said the new mainframes would help customers reduce the number of people needed to manage data as well as cut the cost of manufacturing. The new models offer faster high-volume transaction processing, as with credit card checks or airline reservations, and have scientific and technical applications as in aerospace design. More than 67 upgrade options are available in the series. From the basic system, the customer has 67 different ways to increase capacity. In addition to the new mainframes, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its MVS-ESA operating system is available, a month ahead of schedule. This operating system can be used with the 3090-E models as well as new S models. The company also announced an improvement offering higher performance levels for customers who use the computers for numerically intensive work, such as weather forecasting and oil exploration.

<HEAD>Feds Accuse Attorney Of Racketeering Violations In Insider Trading
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time, federal prosecutors have brought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insider trading and said they would use the law more in the future to crack down on financial wrongdoing. Attorney <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> was one of 12 people indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury for alleged financial crimes. `` This is the first time in history we've used the racketeering statute in an insider trading case,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, now of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was accused of making $ 680,000 in illegal profits by using information he obtained when he was a partner of the <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> law firm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` He misappropriated the confidential information of his firm and of the clients,'' said <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. On nine occasions, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> learned of large pending stock acquisitions by clients, then invested heavily in the company whose stock was being bought, the government alleged. The racketeering statute provides greater penalties and gives the government greater power to seize illicit gains than other laws prohibiting insider trading, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` In the future, we expect to use the racketeering laws as a powerful weapon in these cases,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is charged in the 70-count indictment with wire fraud, securities fraud, racketeering and filing a false income tax return. If convicted on all counts, he could be fined $ 13.5 million and forced to make restitution of any illegal profits. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 44, could not be located for comment. Directory assistance for <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> had no listing for him and his former law firm said it had no knowledge of his whereabouts. Eight of the 12 people indicted Tuesday were accused in a separate $ 1.2 million scheme of churning accounts, a practice of brokers trading on customers' accounts merely to generate commissions. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said none of the 120 customers involved ever made a profit. The government alleged the scheme was carried out by officers and employees of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with branches in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Those indicted include <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Josten </PERSON>, an owner and president of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted <PERSON> Josten </PERSON>'s last known residence was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but directory assistance had no listing for him. Indictments also were returned against three people in an ongoing investigation of trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. They are accused of participating in fraudulent trading involving <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, a former broker with <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> pleaded guilty of two counts of fraud in February and was sentenced to three years in prison The government said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> would take successful trades he executed for his company and make it appear that the trades had been made for one of the three independent traders indicted on Tuesday. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said more than $ 700,000 was diverted illegally to the defendants, while <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> got a 35 percent cut. Indicted were <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, 29, who the government said had $ 142,500 illegally diverted to her account; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riss </PERSON>, 29, $ 390,727; and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 35, $ 180,000. All are from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. Conviction would carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence and a $ 750,000 fine.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign trade in the first half of 1988 increased by almost 20 percent over the same period last year, led by sharp jumps in trade with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiangdong </PERSON> told a news conference that total trade was $ 35.8 billion, up 19.5 percent above last year. Exports were up 16.1 percent to $ 20.2 billion and imports climbed 24.3 percent to $ 15.6 billion. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign trade was `` stable and healthy'' and `` demonstrated good prospects of a smooth transition from the old system to the new.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is decentralizing controls over its foreign trade, and is trying to develop export industries while confining imports to machinery and high technology items that will help in the nation's modernization drive <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said that through May, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was $ 2.9 billion, up 26.3 percent from the first five months of 1987. Trade totalled about $ 7.5 billion with the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> region during that time, up 35.5 percent; $ 5.5 billion with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, up 8 percent; $ 3.8 billion with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, up 3.5 percent; and $ 1 billion with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, up 32.1 percent. The ministry's figures differed from those released earlier this month by the Customs Office, which showed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a trade deficit of slightly more than $ 1 billion on total trade of $ 43.2 billion. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said the two offices calculated differently the goods imported and then processed for export. He said the ministry does not include imports of equipment by foreign-funded enterprises which will be used to produce goods for export. Foreign investment jumped by 186 percent in the first half compared with last year, with the approval of 2,109 foreign-funded enterprises, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. The value of those contracts was $ 2 billion, up 130 percent, he said. He said U.S.-invested projects jumped to 85 this year from 34 last year. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> continued leading foreign investors with 79 percent of projects and 67 percent of money invested. Foreign-invested companies in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> exported $ 570 million worth of goods in the first half of the year, up 133 percent, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said.

 The dollar gained slightly today while share prices soared in active trading as traders awaited the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures for the second quarter. The dollar opened at 132.50 yen and traded between 132.37 yen and 132.65 yen before moving back to 132.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's close. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 120.23 points the previous day, surged 434.81 points, or 1.59 percent, to close at 27,738.57. Today's gain was the second-best this year. A 513.09-point spurt was recorded July 19. Volume of the first section totaled 1.3 billion shares, compared to Tuesday's 900 million shares. Construction, real estate and electrical shares led the rise. `` The dollar and share prices were supported by market expectations that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP data would show a solid performance of its economy,'' said one dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. The gross national product is the total retail value of the goods and services produced by a nation's economy in a given period. Share prices were firm and trading was helped by a burst of activity prompted by the first day of trading for the August account, dealers said. Today's transactions will be settled four trading days later on Monday _ Aug. 1. The first day of trading for a new month's account usually attracts buyers.

<HEAD>Deficit Narrows in June, But Improvement Is Below Expectations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed 7 percent to 1.52 billion pounds, or $ 2.6 billion, in June, the government said Wednesday. The improvement was below market expectations, and the pound tumbled on the news. The seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a revised deficit of 1.64 billion pounds in May and a deficit of 793 million pounds in June 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current account deficit, which includes `` invisible'' trade, narrowed 11 percent to 1.02 billion pounds in June from a revised deficit of 1.14 billion pounds in May. This deficit stood at 93 million pounds in June 1987. Last month's trade in invisible items, which covers services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments, was estimated to be in surplus by 500 million pounds. The department previously reported May's trade deficit as 1.71 billion pounds and the current account deficit as 1.21 billion pounds. Market forecasts had called for a June trade deficit of 1.3 billion pounds and a current account deficit of 800 million pounds. Exports totaled 6.82 billion pounds in June, up from a revised 6.54 billion pounds in May and up from 6.4 billion pounds in June 1987. Imports totaled 8.34 billion pounds in June, up from a revised 8.19 billion pounds in May and up from 7.2 billion pounds in June 1987. A foreign exchange dealer at major <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> bank, who was n't identified in accordance with British custom, said the pound was hit by a wave of selling right after the figures were released Shortly after the release of the trade report, the pound was quoted at $ 1.7065, compared with $ 1.7120 just before the announcement. The drop increased fears that interest rates, which have risen sharply since early June, would go up again. That pressured <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> stock prices at midday. But the foreign exchange dealer said it was too early to ascertain if the pound would continue falling. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` These are very disappointing -LRB- trade -RRB- numbers. Whether or not the cost of borrowing has to rise depends on what happens to sterling. Perhaps the markets will ride it out.'' Sterling has risen in the past few trading sessions on the country's relatively high interest rates, but market players had warned that the currency was susceptible to a deterioration of the country's trade balance.

<HEAD>GNP Registers Healthy Gain But At A Price</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with six graphs to UPDATE with GNP report. Picks up 2nd
graf pvs, But stock ...
^By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy expanded at an annual 3.1 percent rate during the second quarter, but with that healthy growth came sharply higher inflation, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product _ the broadest measure of economic health _ was off slightly from a 3.4 percent increase in the first three months of the year. Inflation, however, picked up substantially during the spring, with a price index tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, the biggest advance since a 5.5 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982. This inflation index, which measures a fixed selection of goods, had risen 3.5 percent in the first quarter. Today's report blamed the pickup in inflation on higher costs for a wide range of consumer goods. In another report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said order to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for durable goods quickened by their fastest pace in 30 months in June, when heavy demand for new aircraft pushed orders for `` big ticket'' items up 8.8 percent. But stock traders, unexcited by Tuesday's report, noted that much of the increase came in military goods, a category often subject to wide monthly fluctuations. The stock market struggled to post a slight gain, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rising 2.14 to 2,073.97. In commodities markets, most crop futures prices plummeted in response to forecasts for continued rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In its durable goods report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for items expected to last at least three years totaled $ 125.23 billion last month, $ 10.14 billion higher than the May total. The June increase, which followed a 1.9 percent decline in May, was the biggest advance since an 8.9 percent jump in December 1985 and provided further evidence, analysts said, of the strength in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing. `` Stripping the fluff away, we are still left with a strong pace of activity in the durable goods sector,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. On the labor front, the government said that major collective bargaining settlements in private industry during the first six months of this year provided for wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said this was a slight decline from the 2.9 percent average wage increases in the contracts the last time they were negotiated, generally two to three years ago. The contracts in the first six months of the year covered 1.02 million workers. Separately, most crop futures prices plunged their permitted daily limits on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following forecasts for more rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and reports that recent showers had helped the crops. The broad decline marked the seventh straight day of falling prices for future delivery of soybeans, which closed at their lowest levels in nearly nine weeks.

 Also contributing to growth in the April-June quarter was a $ 14.4 billion rise in consumer spending, which climbed at an annual rate of 2.3 percent. Business investment shot up at a 14 percent annual rate during the spring as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers continued to spend heavily to expand production facilities because of export demands. Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter while imports fell by 6.2 percent. Even housing construction showed some strength in the second quarter, rising by 2.8 percent, partially reversing a 6.5 percent drop in the first quarter. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed GNP growth would slow to a rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent from July through December. `` The rise in interest rates that has already occurred will slow growth in the second half and I am looking for unemployment to rise a little bit as well,'' he said. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Caton </PERSON>, director of forecasting for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, economic forecasting firm, said he was looking for the economy to slow, either on its own or because of inflation-fighting moves on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does n't see some signs that the economy is slowing, then it will move to push interest rates up farther out of fear that inflation could get out of hand,'' <PERSON> Caton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, another private forecasting service, said he believed growth would be reduced by about one-half percentage point in the second half of the year because of the adverse impact of the drought. He said the higher prices consumers will have to pay for food will reduce the amount of income they have to spend on other items.

 The stock market turned in a mixed showing in quiet trading today as traders studied the latest statistics on economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.95 to 2,075.92 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 376 up, 456 down and 539 unchanged.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today reported profits of $ 1.66 billion, or $ 3.43 a share, as strong international sales helped the automaker post another world earnings record in the second quarter. The No. 2 automaker said its earnings during the period ended June 30 rose 11 percent from $ 1.50 billion, or $ 2.90 a share, during the same period last year. Sales during the second quarter jumped 14.8 percent to $ 22.39 billion, from sales of $ 19.50 billion during the year-ago period. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it earned a company record of $ 760 million outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up 23.1 percent from overseas earnings of $ 536 million during the second quarter of 1987. But profits from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations fell 8.8 percent to $ 903 million, from $ 982 million during the same period last year. The company said sales incentives, higher material and labor costs and development of new products depressed domestic earnings. However, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said those costs were offset by reduced manufacturing costs and a lower tax rate. During the three months ended in June, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it increased its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market to 22 percent, up 1.4 percentage points. The overall earnings gains come on the heels of record first-quarter net income of $ 1.62 billion, or $ 3.31 per share, on sales of $ 20.74 billion. That was up 8.8 percent from $ 1.49 billion, or $ 2.87 a share, on first-quarter 1987 sales of $ 18.14 billion. Before <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings were announced, the auto industry's world earnings record was held by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which posted $ 1.61 billion in profits during the first quarter of 1984. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> last week reported a 29 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings. The nation's largest automaker posted profits of $ 1.5 billion, or $ 4.52 a share, on record sales of $ 29.9 billion. That was up from $ 1.17 billion, or $ 3.39 a share, on revenue of $ 26.7 billion during the year-ago period. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 3 carmaker, is expected to report its second-quarter earnings Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> called the second-quarter report `` a credit to the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> team throughout the world.'' They also said in a joint statement: `` The geographic diversity of our operations, as well as our many product and business lines, provided a broad base for our earnings.'' For the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 3.29 billion, or $ 6.74 per share, on sales of $ 43.13 billion, compared with $ 2.99 billion, or $ 5.77 per share, on $ 37.64 billion in sales during the first six months of 1987.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is investigating unusual movements in stocks prior to their mention in upcoming issues of Business Week, the magazine's publisher confirmed Wednesday. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeachy </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which is being joined in the probe by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. According to Wednesday editions of The Wall Street Journal, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> are also participating, but <PERSON> McGeachy </PERSON> could not confirm that claim. Late last week the publishing company confirmed that its legal counsel was investigating suspicious price movements and heavy trading in stocks mentioned in the `` Inside Wall Street'' column before Business Week was available to the public. While the investigation encompasses <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>'s entire operation, some magazine officials believe the information was leaked by someone unrelated to the editorial staff, such as a printer at one of the four plants where Business Week is printed, or a postal worker. The magazine's 960,000 weekly issues are printed early Thursday, released to the press after the market closes that day and to the general public on Friday. Experts had expected <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> to team up with the enforcement operations of stock exchanges and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to trace the leak. <PERSON> McGeachy </PERSON> said the magazine plans to include a statement on the stock activity in this week's issue, due to reach the public on Friday. The statement is expected to confirm that <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> is conducting its own investigation as well as cooperating with authorities. In addition, the statement notes that the magazine's already `` stringent'' internal securities measures have been beefed up.

<HEAD>Business Philosophies Clash in Battle for Savoy Hotel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Savoy, the Edwardian dream hotel on the Thames that still makes its own mattresses and decorates each room differently, is under siege from a mass-market predator. The seven-year struggle for the flagship Savoy and its five sister hotels has become a titanic clash of business philosophies represented by two 79-year-old men. Inside the <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> is Sir <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON>, chairman for 36 years and now a director. He is a former lord mayor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> whose family controls a key 10 percent of Savoy shares. Banging at the door is Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, an Italian immigrant whose <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> empire claims to be the world's most profitable hotel and catering company. The battle, pitting old guard against the new, is the kind of lively confrontation that inspired the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> operettas launched at the adjoining Savoy Theater. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> is a catering adviser to Buckingham Palace, and, to borrow a phrase from `` HMS Pinafore,'' he very much remains an Englishman. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> does the catering at Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Downing Street residence and symbolizes the kind of swashbuckling entrepreneurship that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> deeply admires. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON>'s `` upper crust'' credentials contrast sharply with <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>'s hard-driving commercialism. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> says quality comes before profit. <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> says they go hand-in-hand. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> wrote in a recent circular to shareholders that `` To be sucked into a vast miscellaneous combine like <ORGANIZATION> THF </ORGANIZATION>, many people consider, would be a disaster for our patrons and our staff ... There can be no need to gratify <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>'s ambitions.'' In his 1987 autobiography, Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> claimed the Savoy was falling well short of its potential. He said the group's hotels needed to be refurbished and re-equipped to restore their `` old glamor.'' `` They require a massive injection of capital such as we can provide and which they have not been able to accumulate because of poor profitability,'' <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> claimed. Officials at the Savoy, built in 1889, fear a takeover will endanger its uniquely English identity, its discretion and personal service. `` You've got a difference of philosophy, a <PERSON> David </PERSON> versus a Goliath, a small company that is trying very hard not to be part of a great big one,'' said <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 51, only the fourth managing director of the Savoy in 99 years. `` I just do n't believe they'll provide quite what we do. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> promises to double the Savoy's profits in one year by injecting new money and firing its top management, which it claims is grossly overpaid. `` One of the best hotels in the world ... has been starved of investment and could be a lot better,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, personal assistant to <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, the 43-year-old heir and chief executive. `` We believe that we could make it the best in the world.'' The Savoy earned $ 24 million before taxes last year. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, a 44-nation conglomerate, posted pre-tax profits of $ 306 million last year from its 800 hotels and 3,000 catering outlets. In 1981, <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> captured 69 percent of the ordinary shares in the Savoy but a complex, two-tier share structure designed by <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> to repel takeovers left the company with just 42 percent of voting shares, and no representation in the Savoy boardroom. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> is suing the Savoy over a 5.7 percent block of shares it wants canceled. It claims <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> issued the shares fraudulently to strengthen his personal control over the Savoy when he negotiated its only foreign acquisition, the <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, in 1970. The suit is expected to reach court this fall, and if <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> wins, the Wontner group's absolute majority on the board of 50.5 percent will drop to 47 percent and leave the balance of power in the hands of 2,000 independent shareholders. In a vote July 1, a majority of those shareholders voted to retroactively approve the 5.7 percent share issue, as <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> had urged them to do, but <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> is confident they can be won over. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> said the shares had been placed in a Swiss foundation to help hotel trainees. The foundation, which had <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON>, his daughter and son-in-law on its board, did not declare its shareholding until October 1986. Under British company law, shareholdings in excess of 5 percent must be declared. When it opened, the <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> was a wonder of the age, with 24-hour room service, speaking tubes on every floor, and 67 bathrooms at a time when its most luxurious rival, the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, had just four. The hotel still insists on pure linen sheets and towels, keeps separate kitchens on all seven floors, and decorates each of its 300 rooms individually so that no two are identical. Under <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> contended, `` I think you'd find some pictures might disappear off the walls, you'd find nice bits of furniture would end up in the auction room. Probably a lot of the reserves of wine in our cellars would be sold and we'd get a standard wine list.'' Power denies this, saying: `` We allow places to develop their own character, and we market them as a collection, not a brand or a chain.'' <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> spent $ 12 million restoring the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to its former splendor and `` we actually have a Rembrandt in the <PERSON> George </PERSON> V'' in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. It owns the <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; bought its 19th luxury-grade hotel, the Eden, in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>; and for 25 years it has owned family-run <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Power </PERSON> calls `` the typification of the English hotel, even more so than the Savoy.''

 Six years after its first product was sketched on the back of a pancake house napkin, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> continues to take the computer industry by storm. The Houston-based company last year posted sales of $ 1.2 billion _ reaching the billion-dollar level faster than any other company in history and despite the overwhelming presence of industry giant <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company's first product, a portable computer, was the result of a meeting over coffee involving founders <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. All three worked for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and were brought together on a project to start a disk-drive unit. While with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, the trio decided to venture on their own. `` We did n't really realize the fast track we would be on. We were moving quickly, but we did n't fully understand how big the potential was,'' said <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>. `` When we were raising our initial venture capital, we told the investors that we thought $ 20 million or $ 30 million -LRB- in sales -RRB- the first year was possible and they laughed. That was unheard of. A company had never started with their first-year sales that high.'' <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> and his partners began designing their first personal computer in February 1982. Sales began in 1983. When the year was complete, they had tallied sales of $ 111.2 million, an American business record. Sales in 1984 hit $ 329 million as the company introduced the desktop personal computers, which became one of the top-selling lines of desktop business personal computers within four months. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> climbed into the Fortune 500, making it the first company to do so in four years. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s sales records have continued because its personal computers are compatible with industry standards, meaning they support the largest base of business software programs and add-on equipment. In an industry dominated by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is playing the role of a modern-day <PERSON> David </PERSON>, challenging Goliath head to head. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has gone on to create a new standard with its Personal System-2 line, but many customers prefer to stick with the old one. `` I think we're competing very well with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, 43, company president and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> countered an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> product announcement in June with one of its own in what some analysts said will protect <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership in the 386-processor personal computer market. The new personal computers are based on <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 80386 microprocessor. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s Deskpro 386-25 is the world's most powerful personal computer, according to company spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>. And the <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> Deskpro 386s, <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>'s favorite, is the first personal computer to use a new, cheaper <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> chip. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced additional models of its Personal System-2 line, which included a 25-megahertz 386 machine, but the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> product wo n't be available until September. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> machines already have been shipped. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, which already has 1 million square feet of space in six <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> buildings, in July announced plans for a $ 137 million expansion which will add 1.4 million square feet on 85 acres. The expansion makes room for up to 4,000 more employees, nearly doubling the present worldwide work force of 4,800. `` I kind of like the path we're on,'' <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said of his company's performance. `` I do n't intend to make any major changes. We've developed a system for identifying new product opportunities and then delivering those new products to market quickly.'' Just last week, the company reported a 91 percent jump in profits in the second quarter, to $ 59 million, on sales of $ 457 million. For the first six months of the year, earnings more than doubled, to $ 105 million, on sales of $ 896 million. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lovett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Garrison in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, does n't see <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s growth or profits stumbling. `` I do n't see any clouds in the near-term future. I do n't see any clouds in general,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s ventures. In its third year, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> unveiled its Deskpro 286 model and portable 286 computers. It took <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> nine months to offer a similar product and by that time, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> was enroute to unveiling a suitcase-size portable. The portable 386 and Deskpro 386-20 computers were introduced in September 1987. Eighty percent of the 386-based personal computers sold through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealers during 1987 were <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> personal computers, according to <ORGANIZATION> Storeboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a consulting company that provides market information on the computer industry. The survey somewhat exaggerates <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s share because it misses <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s sales through its direct sales force. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> only sells its products through about 3,000 authorized dealers in 40 countries. `` They primarily are attuned to the marketplace,'' analyst <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` They bring products the public wants and they do well because they are sold only through dealers. They go to great lengths to make sure their dealers are happy.'' Much of the credit for <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s success goes to <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, who has been responsible for overseeing its record-setting growth in all operational areas. <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, who spent 13 years with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, also is responsible for recruiting high-level executives from other corporations. He credits <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s success to teamwork among employees. `` We were naive in many ways and we stuck with some very basic philosophies,'' <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said. `` We did n't have all the answers and we used the capabilities of everybody to come up with good answers. ... That evolved into our culture.'' <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> was named one of the five best-managed companies in 1987 by Business Month magazine. `` What carried the day with the judges was not <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s survival, or even the speed with which its sales homed in on the $ 1 billion mark, but that it accomplished these feats fighting mano a mano with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>,'' the magazine said in its December 1987 issue Internationally, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is establishing a network of manufacturing facilities with a portable and desktop production plant under construction in <LOCATION> Erskine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and a printed-circuit board assembly plant in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s first satellite manufacturing facility outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The company's main assembly operations are in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Co-founder <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who also spent 13 years with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, oversees the technical group that supports all product development. He led development of the original <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> portable personal computer and was instrumental in engineering the company's subsequent products <PERSON> Murto </PERSON> directed and coordinated overall sales operations and marketing before leaving the company in April 1987 to pursue a religious vocation. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s only setback so far came when the company set up a Dallas-based subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1984. Its main product was Telecompaq, which was used to line a telephone and a computer into a single unit. Production stopped last year after an investment of more than $ 20 million, analysts say. Despite that stumble, analysts predict <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> 1988 sales will increase 25 percent to 40 percent, pushing revenues as high as $ 1.8 billion.

 Crop futures opened higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but corn prices turned lower in early trading. Grain and soybean futures were due for a technical rebound after more than a week of mostly falling prices, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it earned 179 million pounds in the first half, rebounding from the same period a year earlier when it lost money because of additions to its loan-loss reserves. The bank's first-half profit, which is the equivalent of $ 306 million, compares with a loss of 521 million pounds in the first six months of 1987. <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>'s 1987 first-half loss was the result of adding 916 million pounds to its reserves to protect against losses from loans to underdeveloped countries. Other major banks around the world took similar steps. In the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> added 90 million pounds to its loan loss reservers. <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>'s revenue in the first six months grew 14 percent to 1.35 billion pounds from 1.18 billion pounds. Interest income rose to 823 million pounds from 686 million pounds a year earlier, wile other income, which includes commissions and foreign exchange earnings, rose to 530 million pounds from 489 million pounds.

<TEXT>
 Acting Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said today that morale at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is not as bad as former top department officials have portrayed it. At his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said, `` The morale is not on the floor.'' On Tuesday, former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> testified that when he resigned March 29 a `` deep malaise'' had set in at the department in the face of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s ongoing legal problems. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, however, testified that he does n't think the morale problem is as serious as <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and former criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> portrayed it _ `` at least not today.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said that when he came to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in May after serving as an assistant treasury secretary, `` I was under the impression'' that it was `` a black hole over there'' in terms of morale. `` I found that was not the case,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` I think the department is functioning well and I look forward to serving under'' the man chosen by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to be <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s successor, former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was asked by Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., what could be done to improve morale at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> replied that it is important for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to confirm nominees to top positions in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is serving in an acting capacity in the No. 3 job in the department while <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> is serving as acting deputy attorney general. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> is the acting attorney general in charge of the criminal division. The judiciary committee is holding a confirmation hearing on <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> today; a hearing for <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> is scheduled for Thursday. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has a `` blind spot'' on ethical issues and allowed himself to be `` hornswaggled'' by a friend trying to benefit from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s influence. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> also described Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as showing deep concern in a meeting to discuss the resignation of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and former criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> last March. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told the judiciary committee that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had created an `` Alice in <LOCATION> Wonderland </LOCATION> world where right was wrong and wrong became right.'' `` I am clinging to the notion that <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had a blind spot where these ethical issues were concerned and that he was taken advantage of, that he was abused, that he was hornswaggled by one <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said today on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told the committee that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a longtime friend of the attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has announced he will resign at the end of the month now that an independent counsel has decided not to bring charges against him following a lengthy investigation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has criticized the special counsel, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, for saying in his report that the attorney general `` probably committed'' three felonies and a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> interview, described a meeting in which he and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> explained to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> why they were resigning. `` The vice president was distressed. I've described him as being florid,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` He asked quesitons, and there was no doubt when I left the meeting I felt that in time the problem would be solved, as it has been by Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> participated actively in the meeting. `` He was both vocal and there was a lot of body language,'' he said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s supporters were trying to undercut congressional testimony by the former top aides. Complimentary letters about the attorney general from 10 current and former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were released at the same time Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee was hearing testimony highly critical of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told the committee the attorney general was responsible for a `` deep malaise'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> responded by citing the favorable letters, saying `` it appears that the rest of the leaders of the department do n't agree with Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and they're the ones that are much closer to the career employees.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> testified to the commitee that he resigned in protest last March 29, along with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, after telling <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the attorney general had probably broken the law. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told the judiciary committee that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from longtime friend <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, at whose request <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had provided assistance to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and on a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that on the morning he and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> resigned, the criminal division chief told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>: `` Ed, I do n't gainsay that there are other reasons why you might have wanted to push these two projects -LRB- a $ 32 million engine contract for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline -RRB- _ redeem the campaign pledge in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, save our cities, peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. That is not the question. `` The question is whether Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is taking official actions that he knows are going to rebound to the financial benefit of his friend.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> responded that aggressive prosecutors can take the facts `` a little bit too far'' and pointed to the conclusion by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had not violated the gratuities statute. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said in his 814-page report that `` there is no direct evidence that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> accepted anything of value from Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> with the requisite state of mind for a gratuities violation.'' However, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should have been sensitive to the possibility that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s motivation was to show appreciation for official activities benefiting him.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel's Profit Triples in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit tripled in the second quarter from a year earlier, boosted by higher steel prices, increased shipments, improved productivity and lower financing costs. The steelmaker reported on Wednesday second-quarter profit of $ 151 million, or $ 2.05 a share, up from $ 47 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose 27.3 percent, to $ 1.4 billion from $ 1.1 billion. `` We expect favorable steel market conditions to continue through the balance of the year,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` Although steel shipments may decline modestly in the third quarter due to normal seasonal factors, they should continue at relatively high levels and prices are expected to remain firm.'' The company's basic steel operations posted second-quarter profit of $ 166 million and earnings for the first half of the year of $ 264 million, up from $ 47 million and $ 96 million for the same periods in 1987. Earnings at <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s plant at Sparrows Point, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, also improved over last year, the company said. The steel bar, rod and wire division in <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, posted second-quarter losses, but improved from last year's losses because of increased shipments. The company's plant at <LOCATION> Steelton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, continued to incur losses in the second quarter and the first six months of the year because of depressed markets for rail and large diameter pipe, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said. In the first half of the year, the steelmaker's profit tripled to $ 236 million, or $ 3.32 a share, from $ 72 million, or $ 1.17 a share, a year earlier. First-half revenue rose to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.26 billion.

The complex deal also calls for sale to the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s holdings in American President Cos.. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and three other companies and would give <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> a 40 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> The companies valued the total deal at $ 1.2 billion in cash and stock. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, a holding company run by investor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON> out of this <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-area </LOCATION> coastal enclave, said it would receive $ 827 million cash and 18.7 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> stock, giving it a 40 percent share of the transportation, dredging and wiring company. <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> would get <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s 16.9 percent share of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>; its 9.6 percent holding in American President, an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, - based container freight company; and its 13.2 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> also would get <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s wholly owned <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Equilease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, which has bought and reshuffled a number of companies in recent years, would be subject to a 10-year standstill agreement limiting the way its <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> shares could be voted or sold and restricting further purchases, <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> said. An affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zell </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> has agreed to buy warrants for purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> stock to keep the men's 20 percent equity share, the company said. The railroad portion of the deal is subject to federal antitrust review, which <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> said is expected to take 30 days. The transaction would allow <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> to combine 30,000 railroad cars owned by Signal's Pullman Leasing with <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s 43,000 cars to make the largest railcar leasing operation in the country, <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> said. On March 18, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> abandoned plans to wage a proxy fight to gain seats on <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s board after an adverse court decision and said it would consider selling its stock in the railroad company. The action ended a six-month battle in which <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> had at various times sought unsuccessfully to acquire all or part of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> and had challenged the rail company's plans to restructure and sell off assets. In announcing the deal, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> also said it was proceeding with plans to split its businesses into two companies. After the <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> deal closes, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> said, it will file documents with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> concerning the split into The <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wheelabrator would own <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s share of <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other assets related to the waste-to-energy business The <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would hold the rest of the company's assets.

 <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its second-quarter earnings rose 16.3 percent due a lower tax rate and continuing growth of its beer business For the second quarter, net income was $ 211.5 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with of $ 181.8 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose 6.3 percent to $ 2.53 billion from $ 2.38 billion for the same period a year ago. August <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the company's president, said Budweiser sales continue to grow and its Busch brand `` experienced broad-based geographic growth.'' <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>, Michelob Light and Natural Light continued to experience double-digit growth in the light-beer segment, the fastest growing segment in the industry. The company said growth in net income and earnings per share benefitted from the phase-in of lower federal income tax rates. For the first half of the year, net income was $ 363.9 million, or $ 1.23 a share, up 17.4 percent from net income of $ 309.9 million, or $ 1.02 a share, a year earlier.

 Prices edged higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after long-awaited <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic reports failed to send any clear-cut signals to the stock market. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 3.1 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,840.8. Volume was 363.9 million shares, up from 338 million shares traded Tuesday. The British trade report, which showed a June deficit at the high end of market expectations, knocked the index to its session low of 9.2 points below Tuesday's close. But in the absence of concerted selling pressure, the index then recovered to about the same level as before the report was released, dealers said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed 7 percent to 1.52 billion pounds, or about $ 2.6 billion, in June, the government said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current account deficit, which includes trade such as services, narrowed 11 percent to 1.02 billion pounds, or about $ 1.7 billion. The pound responded to the trade numbers by falling suddenly, but then recovered most of its losses.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that its after-tax profit rose 29.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, boosted by increased traffic and lower employee costs. The rail line, one of the nation's largest, said Wednesday that its second-quarter profit rose to $ 158.2 million, or 87 cents a share, from $ 122.4 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said the earnings were the highest since its reorganization in 1982. Second-quarter revenue increased 6 percent, to $ 1.11 billion from $ 1.04 billion. `` This very favorable performance is due to the combination of increased traffic and revenues, and reduced employee costs,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> operates <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> said rail traffic was up 5.9 percent in the second quarter, while rail expenses showed no increase He attributed that to continued benefits from last year's voluntary early retirement program. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON>, a company representative, said 2,100 nonunion management employees had taken early retirement. Thirty-five hundred union members _ conductors, firemen, engineers and clerks _ have opted for the retirement or separation programs since they were first offered in 1985. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 11.9 percent, to $ 276.7 million, or $ 1.51 a share, from $ 247.2 million, or $ 1.30 a share, a year earlier. The 1987 period included an after-tax gain of $ 32.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from the sale of 2.3 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> stock. First-half revenue was up 5.8 percent, to $ 2.14 billion from $ 2.02 billion.

<HEAD>Ford Reports Another Quarterly Earnings Record</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that its second-quarter earnings climbed 11 percent from a year ago to $ 1.66 billion, setting an auto industry record for the second consecutive quarter. The profit was 2.5 percent above the previous industry record the No. 2 automaker set in the first three months of this year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings, which work out to $ 3.43 per share, came on second-quarter sales of $ 22.39 billion. During the same period last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.50 billion, or $ 2.90 per share, on sales of $ 19.50 billion. In April, the company reported earnings of $ 1.62 billion, or $ 3.31 per share, on sales of $ 20.74 billion for the first three months of 1988. That broke the previous auto industry quarterly earnings record of $ 1.61 billion posted by the much-larger <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the first quarter of 1984. `` We're just delighted with these earnings, ...'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance, said Wednesday. `` But we ca n't let up because the competition is tough.'' Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported a 29-percent increase in its second-quarter earnings, compared with the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 3 automaker, is to report its second-quarter figures Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its latest earnings were based on strong business in its international operations. The company said it made a record $ 760 million outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the quarter, up 23.1 percent from overseas earnings of $ 536 million during the April-June period last year. The bulk of the overseas gains came in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where strong sales volumes and currency rate changes pushed profits up, the company said. `` The present leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> was internationally trained,'' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> auto analyst <PERSON> Arvid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` The first <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was a world-class guy. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- became international long before anybody else even thought about it.'' The increases overseas offset an 8.8 percent decrease in its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> earnings, which dropped to $ 903 million in the second three months of this year from $ 982 million during the same period in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. The company said sales incentives, higher material and labor costs and development of new products depressed domestic earnings. But <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said those costs were offset partially by reduced manufacturing costs and a lower tax rate. For the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has earned $ 3.29 billion, or $ 6.74 per share, on sales of $ 43.13 billion, up 10 percent over the $ 2.99 billion, or $ 5.77 per share, on $ 37.64 billion in sales it made during the first six months of 1987. Wednesday marked the ninth straight quarter in which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has reported a record company profit and the fourth quarter in a row in which it has outearned <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. `` Of course, to beat <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> the way they have is like winning two gold medals in the Olympics,'' <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON> said. `` I've felt them to be the best-managed worldwide corporation. Today, they're proving it.'' Despite the showing, <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON> said he does n't expect <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to continue on the same pace. `` This is the last time that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, in the near future, will beat <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in its earnings,'' he predicted. `` They are very close right now, even in the second quarter and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has the momentum to stay where it is, ...'' <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON> added, `` but it's easier to move upward than to move down, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> has surely been down.'' Another analyst, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, disagreed. `` My guess is that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is not gaining on them,'' he said. `` If you look at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s profits, they are just what they should have been. ... There's a big gap of profitability there that is not being closed. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will have three times the profit margin of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> this year,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. `` GM does not appear to be catching up.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said its second-quarter net income slipped 1 percent to $ 263 million partly because of lower earnings from its oil and gas exploration and production division. Net income totaled $ 266 million in the 1987 period. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, does not release per share figures. Revenue totaled $ 5.4 billion for the quarter, up from $ 5.2 billion a year ago. In the oil and gas exploration and production division, earnings totaled $ 73 million in the second quarter, down from $ 152 million for the same period last year. But earnings from oil products nearly doubled, totaling $ 103 million in the second quarter, compared with $ 56 million in the year-ago period. Earnings from chemical products were $ 133 million, up from $ 101 million in the same period last year. Shell President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said strong earnings in the oil and chemical products divisions helped to offset the decline in exploration and production earnings, which mainly reflected lower crude oil prices. `` The outlook in our exploration and production segment is, for the most part, tied directly to crude oil and natural gas prices. Crude oil prices have been at lower levels than a year ago,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. For the first six months, net income totaled $ 609 million, a 63 percent increase from the $ 374 million earned in the first half of 1987. Total consolidated net income for the first half was $ 1.5 billion, which includes a one-time gain of $ 900 million as a result of a new accounting measures adopted in the first quarter. Six-month revenue totaled $ 10.5 billion this year and $ 9.7 billion last year.

The decision does not affect the three Kroger-owned warehouse stores, known as <ORGANIZATION> Welcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntire </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Choice's 5,000 employees were notified of the decision Wednesday The stores will continue to operate until they have been sold, he said. <PERSON> McIntire </PERSON> would not say how much money the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> chain has lost or for how long it has been unprofitable. He also would not say how much money <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> felt it had to invest to be competitive. He said optimistic estimates indicated that many of the stores could be sold in 60 days. The stores could be sold individually or as a chain, with profits being reinvested in other <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stores or being used to repurchase <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> common stock periodically, <PERSON> McIntire </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> entered the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> market in 1980 when it opened a SupeRx drugstore there. The SupeRx chain was sold in 1986 and the remaining supermarkets were renamed <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Choice.

<HEAD>Frosts Hit Brazilian Coffee Plantations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Frosts that hit <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s southern coffee belt this week may reduce next year's expected bumper harvest, government agronomists said Wednesday. The extent of the damage was not immediately known but was not thought to be heavy, the agronomists said. `` If <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was expecting a harvest of 40 million bags next year, the frost might reduce it to 39 million,'' <ORGANIZATION> Erlei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION>, an agonomist with the government's Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Varginha </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Minas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerais </ORGANIZATION> state, the country's No. 1 Coffee-growing state. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is the world's largest coffee grower and exporter, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is its main market. <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION> said frosts Tuesday and Wednesday `` affected the tips and leaves of coffee trees, which will produce less next year. But the inner part of the branches was not hurt.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerais </ORGANIZATION> is expected to produce about 8.3 million 132-pound bags of coffee this year, about one-third of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s total crop. The cold weather does not affect this year's harvest, which is already being picked. But it can hurt next season's production that starts when the coffee trees flower in September. In <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> state, the No. 2 Coffee producer, light frosts occurred in the northwestern coffee plantations but did not cause significant damage, said <PERSON> Alceu </PERSON> <PERSON> Veiga </PERSON> <PERSON> Filho </PERSON>, an economist with the <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Frosts were more severe in <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION>, the third-largest coffee producer, south of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. `` The frosts hit harder here. Next year's harvest will be down, but we'll only know how much in two or three days,'' <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Simoes </PERSON>, an agronomist with the <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION>, the state capital, 523 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simoes </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> would harvest 2.5 million bags of coffee this year and had expected a 5 million bag harvest in 1989. Temperatures rose slightly in southern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Wednesday but frost warnings were still posted for the coffee belt. After severe frosts in the mid-1970s, many of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s coffee trees were replanted farther north, where the weather in winter is warmer.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its second-quarter profit jumped 27 percent because gains in a number of key businesses. Net income totaled $ 639 million, or $ 2.67 a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $ 504 million, or $ 2.08 a share, in the second quarter of 1987. Sales during the period rose 9 percent to $ 8.5 billion, from $ 7.8 billion last year. Second-quarter earnings included a $ 43 million gain from the sale of the company's interest in a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil property. Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> attributed the second-quarter showing to strong sales and earnings from a number of the company's operations including agricultural and industrial chemicals as well as downstream petroleum and coal `` The company's effort to expand markets worldwide, coupled with continued emphasis on productivity, were important factors in our earnings growth,'' he said. Net income for the first six months rose 37 percent to $ 1.2 billion, or $ 5.12 a share, compared with $ 895 million, or $ 3.70 a share in the year-ago period. Sales for the first six months were $ 16.5 billion, up 10 percent from the $ 14.9 billion during the same period last year.

<HEAD>Pan Am Posts $5 Million Loss; USAir's Profit Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported a net loss of $ 5 million in the second quarter, while <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its after-tax profit rose 21 percent during the same period. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said the loss compared with an after-tax profit of $ 10.5 million, or 8 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987. The loss occurred despite a 19.8 percent rise in second-quarter revenue, to $ 1.07 billion from $ 896.8 million a year earlier. The company blamed the earnings deterioration largely on a loss of $ 19.9 million at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, compared with profit of $ 6.3 million a year earlier. The loss at <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s main subsidiary, was partly offset by improvement in its Northeast shuttle operation, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' earnings were hurt by increased fuel costs, higher aircraft rental charges and higher costs of new maintenance standards, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> recently reached a tentative labor agreement with leaders of its biggest union, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, and withdrew its earlier threat to sell a large portion of its assets. The accord, if ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' membership, is expected to save the airline around $ 81 million over the next three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union is the third out of the five unions at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to sign a new cost-saving contract with the carrier, which is still seeking $ 90 million in wage cuts from its flight attendants and has imposed $ 35 million in reductions on the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> under federal labor rules. The new agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> `` brings us significantly nearer to finalizing our total labor cost reduction package,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said in announcing the second-quarter results. The company has lost about $ 1.7 billion since 1981. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s loss widened to $ 88.4 million from a loss of $ 83.1 million a year earlier. First-half revenue was up 19.2 percent, to $ 1.97 billion from $ 1.66 billion. Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the ninth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier, reported that its second-quarter profit rose to $ 92.5 million, or $ 2.14 a share, from $ 72.7 million, or $ 2.32 a share, on 25.8 percent fewer shares a year earlier. Revenue in the latest quarter more than doubled, to $ 1.5 billion from $ 619.6 million. `` Second-quarter results are indicators of trends that began in March and have continued to date,'' said Chairman and President <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colodny </PERSON>. `` I am also pleased that all subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> contributed to the record profitability of the second quarter.'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> operations include <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, four wholly-owned commuter airline subsidiaries, and a leasing and servicing unit. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987, was merged into <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> on April 9 of this year. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> is to be merged into <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> in early 1989. In the first six months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s net income declined 23.4 percent _ to $ 73.7 million, or $ 1.70 a share, from $ 96.2 million, or $ 3.13 a share.

<HEAD>Rain Fears Hold Crop Futures In Check; Mixed Close</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Jitters about next week's weather held crop futures prices in check Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> where corn prices fell, soybeans were mixed and wheat was higher. On other markets, coffee futures plummeted; sugar fell sharply; precious metals were higher; livestock and meat were mixed; energy futures advanced; and stock-index futures retreated. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> grain and soybean futures traded higher for most of the session in a technical rebound following seven straight days of generally falling prices linked to improved crop conditions in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But late in the session a rumor surfaced that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s new 6-to-10-day forecast would predict normal rainfall in the region during the middle of next week, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The rumor was correct. The forecast, released about 1 -LCB- hours after the close, called for above-normal temperatures and normal rainfall in most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the five days beginning Tuesday. A similar rumor on Monday had been borne out by the 6-to-10-day forecast released that day. `` Today people started selling when they heard that rumor and down we went,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. The price rise earlier in the day reflected bargain-basement buying after the sharp break in prices _ particularly for soybeans _ during the past seven days, analysts said. Soybeans for August delivery had tumbled nearly $ 2.40 during that period to a 9-week low of $ 7.55 -LCB- a bushel. `` This market has undergone significant damage and I think people now will be more inclined to buy on the breaks,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, grains analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large Chicago-based commodity trading firm. Wheat settled 4 cents to 10 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.61 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 8 -LCB- cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.79 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 8 cents higher with September at $ 2.49 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 17 cents higher with August at $ 7.53 -LCB- a bushel Coffee futures plummeted to their lowest levels since Dec. 14 on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, mimicking Tuesday's sharp sell-off in sugar futures Sugar futures extended their losses. The coffee market plunged despite the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it was cutting export quotas in a move designed to bolster prices, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The 1.5-million-bag quota reduction brought to 51.5 million bags the total amount of coffee that producer countries may export during the current marketing year, which ends on Sept. 30. It was the second quota reduction this quarter and the ICO is allowed no make no more quota cuts for the marketing year. The sell-off was triggered when the price for September delivery of coffee slipped below $ 1.31 a pound, a psychologically important level for technical traders, <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON> said. `` We just saw a wholesale bailout of speculative and fund money from the market today,'' he said. September coffee settled 8.90 cents lower at $ 1.2405 a pound. October sugar settled .71 cents lower at 11.35 cents a pound. Strong cash prices and expectations for a bullish cattle inventory report Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> supported cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The cattle inventory report is expected to show that drought-related selling of cattle by producers has reduced the nation's cattle herd to its lowest level in 25 years, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, livestock market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Pork futures finished mostly lower, with hog prices pressured by a drop in the volatile pork-belly market, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .48 cent to .97 cent higher with August at 66.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.25 cents higher with August at 78.82 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 45.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.85 cents lower to .20 cent higher with August at 32.95 cents a pound. Precious metal futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were buoyed by a government report that inflation had risen 4.7 percent in the first quarter, the sharpest increase in almost six years, analysts said. Gold settled $ 1.50 to $ 1.80 higher with August at $ 433.50 a troy ounce; silver was 6.8 cents to 9.6 cents higher with July at $ 6.964 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices headed higher in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting some new optimism about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s prospects for bolstering prices West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 26 cents higher with September at $ 16.16 a barrel; heating oil was .45 cent to 1.22 cents higher with August at 45.03 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to .80 cent higher with August at 50.80 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its second-quarter earnings rose 8 percent on a 29 percent revenue increase despite a sluggish performance in the company's core business, photographic products. For the quarter ended June 12, the company earned $ 390 million, or $ 1.20 a share, up from $ 362 million, or $ 1.06 a share, a year ago. Sales totaled $ 4.13 billion, up from the $ 3.21 billion recorded in last year's second quarter. Both the earnings and sales figures were records for the quarter, the company said. `` I think these numbers are more of a surprise than most people thought,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON>, a stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gundy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It looks like everything is cooking on all burners.'' Although sales and earnings were higher because of last February's acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of such products as <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> aspirin and Lysol disinfectant sprays, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said records would have been set even without <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>'s help. `` It's hard to single out any one thing that really stood out. We had good advances across the board,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. He was unable to provide exact figures on just how helpful Sterling has been to <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s bottom line. A lower corporate income tax rate also helped <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to the record, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Profits for the first six months of the year were up 20 percent at a record $ 650 million, or $ 2 a share, compared with the first half of 1987 when they were $ 540 million, or $ 1.59 a share. Sales for the first half of the year, at $ 7.46 billion, were up 27 percent, compared with last year's $ 5.86 billion. The company, which is one of this country's 10 largest exporters, continued to enjoy the benefits of the weak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar that has made American products cheaper overseas. The best example of this can be found in <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s imaging segment, which includes the company's mainstay products of film and photographic paper. Sales in this country declined 1 percent in the second quarter, but jumped 13 percent elsewhere. Overall, sales for the second quarter increased 24 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 33 percent in the rest of the world. The imaging segment offered the most interesting aspect of the financial report, according to <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>. Worldwide profits for both the quarter and the first half of the year were down, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> noted. `` This is because of a very significant sales phenomenon as a result of the introduction of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s new ` Gold' film,'' he said. `` Dealers are selling out of inventory with the old film and have n't been able to order enough of the new film from <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>.'' As a result film sales are on the decline, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> adressed that problem in his brief comment about the financial results when he noted that early results from the third quarter indicate strong sales of the new Kodacolor Gold film.

 The dollar fell against most major currencies Wednesday following a government report showing slower-than-expected growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and intervention by central banks. Gold prices were mostly higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 433.45 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 431.90 late Tuesday. Analysts said the dollar fell quickly after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the gross national product rose 3.1 percent in the second quarter. Analysts said the market had expected a rise to between 3.4 percent and 4 percent. European traders had been scooping up dollars before the report, anticipating a healthier growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, but they hurried to dump their dollar holdings once the report was out, dealers overseas said. `` Europeans have been fairly bullish and buying dollars for days,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdain </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But following the report, `` the dollar dropped off very quickly on panic selling. They wanted to get out,'' he said. Analysts said the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the market, selling dollars and buying marks to keep the currency stable. Central bank intervention as well as statements by European government officials and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> implied that the dollar was within a recent target range set by the Group of Seven nations, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> includes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.35 Japanese yen to a closing 132.50 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell back to 131.68 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it fell to 131.63 from 132.43 late Tuesday. The dollar's fall pushed up the British pound despite a larger-than-expected rise in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade deficit in June. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7265 late in the day, up from $ 1.7135 late Tuesday. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, it cost $ 1.7288 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.7075 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8593; 1.5384 Swiss francs, down from 1.5463; 6.2255 French francs, down from 6.2615; 1,364.00 Italian lire, down from 1,373.25; and 1.2056 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2093 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8495 West German marks, down from 1.8600; 1.5375 Swiss francs, down from 1.5455; 6.2375 French francs, down from 6.2670; 2.0820 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0975; 1,365.50 Italian lire, down from 1,374.50; and 1.2070 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2083 Gold and silver prices held within a narrow range. Dealers in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> said the two metals appear to have found some technical support after their plunge on Monday, when gold fell almost $ 16 and ounce, and silver dropped 55.5 cents. Gold closed at $ 433.30 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 431.10 late Tuesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold slipped to a late bid price of $ 433 a troy ounce, from $ 433.50 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 432.50, up from $ 431.50 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid price of $ 432.34, unchanged from Tuesday. Silver finished at $ 6.964 a troy ounce on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, up from $ 6.880 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, silver fell to a late bid price of $ 7.00 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $ 7.01.

<HEAD>Primerica Earnings Flat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported flat second-quarter earnings on a 45 percent increase in revenues. Net income for the quarter totaled $ 50.5 million, the same as the second quarter in 1987. A slight drop in the number of outstanding shares increased per-share earnings to 91 cents. The Greenwich-based company said a gain from retiring debt added 10 cents per share or $ 5.4 million to the earnings totals for the period. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> revenues for the 1988 second quarter were $ 1.1 billion up from $ 748.5 million a year ago. The revenues included those generated by <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Net income for the first half of the year totaled $ 106.2 million, off from $ 120.2 million last year. Revenues in the first half of 1988 were $ 2.1 billion, compared to $ 1.5 billion in the same period in 1987. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said, `` Many of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s businesses performed well during the second quarter, and earnings continued to benefit from lower corporate expenses.'' He also said the operating income for the company's financial services businesses, excluding investment banking and securities brokerage, was `` limited to a 3 percent improvement year-to year, primarily due to lower earnings from the company's mutual fund subsidiary resulting from continued investor uncertainity. `` <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>'s commissions, trading and underwriting revenues were adversely affected by prolonged sluggishness in the financial markets, resulting in a small operating loss for the investment banking and securities brokerage subsidiary during the period,'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is raising prices for one model and cutting the cost of two others to remain competitive in the subcompact car market. The cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> will decrease 3 percent compared with a comparably equipped 1988 model, from $ 7,503 to $ 7,279.

 Investors who jumped into the agricultural commodity markets when the Midwestern drought became apparent last spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather changed for the wetter, experts say. With crop conditions either static or improving, prices for future delivery of grains and soybeans have fallen precipitously. `` This is not a good market for speculators anymore,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, grain market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the livestock and sugar futures markets, and has prompted some economists to lower their month-old projections for 1989 food inflation from about 7 percent to 6 percent or less. That may be good news for consumers but it's a weak balm for the bruised speculators who bet on rising crop prices but failed to collect their winnings when the markets peaked late last month and early this month. The ensuing decline accelerated last week into a tailspin that ended Tuesday with soybeans for August delivery at $ 7.55 -LCB- a bushel, a 31 percent drop from the contract's high of $ 10.93 -LCB-, reached on June 23. The value of a 5,000-bushel soybean contract plunged nearly $ 17,000 during the period. August corn settled Tuesday at $ 2.87 -LCB- a bushel, down 21 percent from its high of $ 3.64 on July 5. The reason for the collapse: rain. After 2 -LCB- months of unseasonable heat and very little water in the Corn Belt, the Midwestern weather suddenly turned friendly to the struggling crops about two weeks ago. Five days of scattered showers were followed by cool temperatures, then more rain, then more cool temperatures. The change in the weather `` turned this market on a dime,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, chief grain market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large, Chicago-based speculative trading firm. `` Trees do n't grow to the sky, and this certainly is a reminder of that old trading adage.'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. `` Things do n't go up forever.'' Soybean futures best illustrate the rise and fall of the agricultural commodities because the nation's relatively small soybean stockpile has made that market extremely sensitive to changing weather patterns during the growing season. Speculative interest in soybeans began mounting in April after the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> predicted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean inventories would total about 290 million bushels when the new marketing year begins on Sept. 1, down from 436 million bushels a year earlier. On April 4, August soybean futures settled at $ 6.80 a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Speculators who bought in at that price and sold just before the market peaked realized enormous profits. They could sell today and still come out ahead. Analysts say the biggest losers were speculators who bought into the soybean market at about $ 9 a bushel in mid-June and were determined not to sell until prices topped $ 11. Soybeans never went that high and by the second week in July, those investors were losing money on paper. Many have been forced to sell at a loss. `` People bought on emotion rather than on supply and demand and, lo and behold, those speculators are out now,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gelderman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> trading firm that caters to commercial processors of grain. `` It's not easy to make money trading commodities and I think a lot of people found that out,'' he said. Some commodity funds managed by large investment houses and speculative commodity-trading firms had gains as high as 35 percent in June, said <PERSON> Chicagoan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Klopfenstein </PERSON>, who tracks more than 90 such investment pools and publishes their results in his monthly Norwood Index. But <PERSON> Klopfenstein </PERSON>'s own fund, the Norwood Hyacinth Fund, was down 12 percent as of Wednesday morning, according to its management firm, <ORGANIZATION> Dunn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stuart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Sophisticated commodity traders can profit from a falling market as well as a rising one But analysts said the public loves a bull market and it's difficult to persuade investors to bet that prices will fall. <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said American farmers also were losers in the drought rally. He said grain growers could have used futures and options markets to lock in high prices for their crops for the next two or three years, but relatively few did. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmer is at fault here,'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. `` We had these prices up here for a month and he just let them go by.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Express Doubts on FCC Proposal in Telephone Regulation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee said Wednesday they remain unconvinced that consumers will benefit from a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposal to change the way telephone companies are regulated. Panel members said they were open-minded about the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to lift limits on the profits of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone companies and instead set a ceiling on prices But they said they have yet to see evidence that the change would benefit ratepayers. `` The only thing that we know for certain is that this plan has raised more questions than it answers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., subcommimttee chairman AT & amp; T and the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies have been lobbying hard for a change from profit regulation to price caps, but other players in the telecommunications industry fear the proposal would give these large companies too much power over competitors. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effect next year unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted to block the plan or pressured the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to drop it. At the panel's hearing, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> vice president of marketing services, supported the plan as it applied to his company, the nation's largest long-distance company and serving about 70 percent of the market. The rates of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, the only long-distance company whose interstate business is federally regulated, set the pace for the rest of the industry. Limits on prices rather than profits would `` in all probability result in greater price decreases or smaller price increases'' by creating incentives for cost-savings by allowing the company to be more competitive and innovative, <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON> said. But as applied to the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, the proposal fails to assure that charges for connection to the local phone networks will drop with declining costs, he said. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 long-distance company, also opposes price caps for the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies because of the local companies' control of access to the local phone network. Local access charges are already excessive, and higher charges would simply raise long-distance rates for consumers, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies and thus consumers would benefit from the same encouragement for cost-savings, efficiencies and innovation that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would under price caps. At a minimum, local phone rates would go up 3 percent less than inflation, he said. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Competitive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 100 long-distance companies, said lifting profit regulation on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies would be a mistake. `` Deregulating monopolies is just not good policy,'' <PERSON> Dundon </PERSON> said. Without adequate controls, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would be able to undercut competition by charging below cost for some services and making up the difference with higher prices on essential services. The Bell companies, given more flexibility, could tailor service arrangements for the large long-distance companies at the expense of the smaller companies. `` The price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitive environment, where market forces would exercise a check on excessive or predatory prices,'' he said in his testimony.

<HEAD>New Leasing Company Plans ``Significant'' Order Of Boeing 757s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new aircraft leasing company formed by <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> plans to acquire a `` significant fleet'' of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 passenger jets, in a deal possibly worth billions of dollars to the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> planemaker, a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit, said the company envisions an order `` in the range of recent deals completed by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.'' In May, American announced it was buying 50 757-200s and taking options on 50 more in a deal worth more than $ 4 billion if all 100 planes are delivered. A few days later, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said it was ordering 30 757s and taking options on 30 more, an order <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> valued at more than $ 2 billion. `` We're talking about that sort of order,'' <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary. `` We ca n't be more specific at the moment.'' He said the two partners in the new venture company, <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, were negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> officials, but he declined to say when an order might be placed. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said he had no information about any negotiations. `` They simply advised us of their preference for the 757 and some of the delivery dates they were looking for,'' he said. `` We do n't have a contract or anything with them at this point,'' he said. `` We're just glad to see it at this point as an endorsement of this particular model.'' Formation of the new company was announced Wednesday by Sir <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>, and T.A. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, who signed a memorandum of understanding in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. GPA currently leases 135 aircraft valued at more than $ 2 billion. The company does not have any 757s, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said, but has 115 of the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s. The twin-engine 757-200 can carry up to 228 passengers for 3,000 nautical miles. The 757, first introduced in 1982, had been a lagging seller until this year, when the American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> orders were placed. So far this year, 121 of the planes have been ordered, compared with 239 for all previous years, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> only lists firm aircraft orders in its records, not options. For 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has orders for 426 commercial jets, worth a total $ 19.01 billion. The company is well on its way to a fourth-straight year of record orders. In 1987, 366 jets worth $ 19.9 billion were ordered. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog of more than 170 757s, and <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said space on the 757 assembly line in suburban <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> has been booked well into 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> says the 757 is unsurpassed for fuel efficiency and exceeds the toughest airport noise standards. But with fuel prices remaining low in recent years, airlines had been reluctant to place orders for the new jets, which run $ 41 million to $ 47 million a copy. Besides being quiet and cheap to run, industry analysts and airline executives have said many carriers are choosing the 757 because the aging planes in airline fleets are starting to require too much maintenance. Also, as airports are becoming more congested, American and other carriers are looking at 757s to replace smaller-capacity planes on many routes. GPA and <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> like the plane because it can be used in a wide variety of applications, including transatlantic flights, <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON> said. `` The 757 is a pretty flexible airplane,'' he said, noting that it is used by a wide range of operators from major trunk airlines to tour operators. <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> also has been a supplier of engines for the plane since its inception. Part of the GPA-Rolls-Royce deal is that the planes will be equipped with <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> RB211-535E4 engines, <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON> said. Of the 360 757s ordered so far, 211 are or will have <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> engines. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> is the other major engine supplier for the plane.

 The arrests of 26 merchants on charges of selling sexually explicit T-sirts have raised questions of anti-Semitism and constitutional rights in this beach resort city. `` That's ridiculous,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON>, who said the sweep was designed to get offensive T-shirts off the streets. The allegations of anti-Semitism surfaced outside a police station Tuesday when those arrested were released on bail. Several defendants and their relatives, who would not identify themselves, complained they were targets of the probe because they were Jewish. `` They feel very badly that they were mistreated,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> <PERSON> Aizenman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chabad </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubavitch </PERSON>, who met and prayed with the defendants at the jail. `` I think it's natural that's -LRB- anti-Semitism -RRB- one of the things that came up. Eighteen of the 26 people arrested were Jewish, <PERSON> Aizenman </PERSON> said Wednesday, adding that 17 were from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kesner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emanuel </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative Jewish congregation, said the issue of anti-Semitism `` is merely a nasty ploy by this group that has been challenged with illegality in their business.'' <PERSON> Kesner </PERSON> said those arrested are not part of his congregation but added `` the Jewish teaching is the law of the land supersedes all other laws.'' <PERSON> Kesner </PERSON> said that during his 24 years in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> `` I have never had an anti-Semitic experience.'' Many of those arrested have declined to talk with reporters, saying they are afraid their complaints might lead to more legal problems. `` Police did n't tell us what not to sell. I just do n't know exactly what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a store owner who was arrested. He said he would stop selling T-shirts when told which ones not to sell. Those arrested are charged with violating state obscenity statutes, a felony offense punishable by up to three years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. Under state law, something is considered obscene if it appeals to the prurient interest in sex, is patently offensive and, when applied to contemporary standards, has no artistic, political or scientific value. Police began buying T-shirts in beach shops over the weekend. They were shown to Solicitor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> who told authorities which decals would be considered obscene under state law. Police have not confiscated any T-shirts from the stores. One of the T-shirts carried a cartoon of a male sex organ wearing a condom with the slogan `` Captain Condom'' on the front. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flom </PERSON>, an attorney representing the merchants, said they were hoping to get a national organization such as the Anti-Defamation League involved in the matter. Bonds in the case were set at amounts ranging from $ 10,000 to $ 30,000 by City Judge <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambe </PERSON>. All those arrested were released by early Wednesday morning. The amount of the bonds was in the same range as those set in three recent murder cases in the county. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushing </PERSON> has agreed to review the bail. The bond amounts brought fire from <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, the executive director of the state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He called them an `` outrage,'' adding `` jaywalking is more dangerous than these shirts.''

<HEAD>Digital Earnings Up 6.4 Percent In Its Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYNARD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings rose by 6.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, reflecting continued worldwide sales growth. The giant computer company posted a profit of $ 401 million, or $ 3.08 per share, in the three months ended July 2. That compared with a profit of $ 377 million, or $ 2.85 per share, in the same quarter last year, the company said. Operating revenue during the quarter rose to $ 3.34 billion from $ 2.67 billion a year earlier. `` We are pleased with the strong gains as our growth continued to outpace that of the industry,'' <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This performance reflects the growing number of large organizations around the world that are implementing <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s enteprise-wide computing solutions,'' <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said For its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 1.3 billion, or $ 9.90 per share, up 15 percent from $ 1.14 billion, or $ 8.53 per share for last year. Revenue rose 22 percent to $ 11.48 billion from $ 9.39 billion last year, the company said. Company officials credited the increased earnings to growth in <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s VAX product line. `` Demand was seen across the whole VAX family,'' <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said. `` At the low end, we shipped more than 12,000 work stations during the fourth quarter and 30,000 for the year, thus reaching a leadership position in this rapidly growing market.'' `` The Micro-VAX 3000 series did particularly well and over 500 VAX 6200 systems were shipped since their introduction three months ago,'' he continued. At the high end, shipment of VAX 8000 Nautilus systems exceeded 3,000 for the year.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in early trading Thursday, while stock prices continued a two-day upswing. The dollar, which fell 0.80 yen to close at 131.65 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, opened in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 131.67 yen, down 0.83 yen from Wednesday's close. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues rose 117.85 points to 27,856.42 early Thursday, following a gain of 434.81 points on Wednesday. Exchange dealers said growing concern about inflation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> following Wednesday's release of second-quarter figures for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> second quarter gross national product pressured the dollar lower. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product, the broadest measure of an economy's health, grew 3.1 percent in the second quarter, down slightly from the revised 3.4 percent rate the previous quarter. But inflation registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982, rising at a 4.7 percent annual pace. Securities analysts dismissed the influence of the dollar's fall on the stock market. `` In today's directionless market, share prices are determined solely based on the supply-demand relationship,'' said <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't apply the same old principle of ` When the dollar falls, stock market also falls' any longer.''

<HEAD>South Korea Current Account Surplus Up 31.7 Percent In First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s overall current account surplus ballooned by 31.7 percent in the first half of this year, although its surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shrank by 14.8 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The nation posted a $ 1.28 billion surplus for the month of June, up from $ 993 million in June 1987. The record monthly surplus boosted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first half surplus to $ 6.06 billion from $ 4.6 billion a year earlier. Officials at the central bank predicted the surplus likely would top $ 10 billion by year end, above the government's recent projection of $ 8.5 billion and last year's record $ 9.85 billion. Officials attributed the growing surplus mainly to continued strong exports. The country's trade balance showed a surplus of $ 1.03 billion in June, compared with $ 823 million in the same month last year, the officials said. The trade surplus in the January-June period rose to $ 4.73 billion from a year ago's $ 3.42 billion. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s global exports in the first half soared 28.1 percent to $ 27 billion and imports rose 26.1 percent to $ 22.3 billion. But <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the first six months shrank to $ 3.91 billion from $ 4.59 billion a year earlier, as Korean imports from that market rose at a much faster rate than its exports to that country. Imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> jumped 43 percent to $ 5.63 billion while exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose 11.6 percent to $ 9.54 billion. The officials said <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the January-June period fell to $ 2.12 billion from $ 2.98 billion a year earlier. The Korean government's trade policy calls for increased imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and fewer from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to try and avoid trade friction with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been pressuring <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to give <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more access to the Korean market to help reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit.
