<HEAD>Union Awaits Negotiators For School District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Negotiators for the 22,000-member teachers' union met again Sunday with school district representatives to seek a solution to a week-old teacher walkout that has caused chaos in city classrooms Representatives of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District arrived around 8:15 p.m., more than two hours after <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> negotiators showed up for talks set to begin at 6 p.m., said <ORGANIZATION> UTLA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. `` It looks like the other side is dragging its feet and trying to prolong this thing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said before they arrived. She added that teachers were prepared for a second week in the walkout that began May 15. `` We'll have our teachers out on the line again,'' she said. `` They've invested too much at this point.'' Details of developments in recent talks have been sketchy because of a news blackout imposed by state mediator <PERSON> Draz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrvichin </PERSON>. The walkout last week played havoc with education in the nearly 600,000 - student district Many students walked out of classes and some joined teachers on picket lines. In some cases, students were housed in auditoriums because the district was unable to hire enough substitute teachers to fill classrooms. During the 16-month-long labor dispute, teachers have sought higher salaries and more say in how the district's 600-plus schools are run. Teachers earn between $ 23,440 and $ 43,319 a year, depending on experience and level of education. The union wants a three-year contract with a 26 percent raise, including a 10 percent raise the first year. The district, the second largest in the nation, has refused to go higher than a 21.5 percent raise over three years. The strike, which began May 15, is the district's first since a 23-day walkout in 1970.

 Family members and a handful of friends attended funeral services Sunday for the man authorities say was the `` godfather'' of a cult linked to at least 15 slayings on the U.S.-Mexican border, a relative said. The body of <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> late Saturday night and was cremated for the funeral Sunday, <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WQBA </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> `` It was always his wish to be cremated,'' said <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, who said only that relatives and close friends were invited to the funeral. He revealed no other details about the services. `` It was a decision of ours to be so private,'' he said. `` We do n't want anyone there that does n't belong there to curse the funeral.'' <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> has been described as the leader of a sect that authorities blame for at least 15 killings outside the border city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. Sect members have said some slayings were ritual killings while others were drug-related. Authorities had sought <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and his female companion <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, 24, since the discovery of the first of the bodies on a border ranch in April.

 Soldiers on Sunday set up roadblocks to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s center and moved into its train station, but hundreds of thousands of students defied martial law and remained in Tiananmen Square despite fears of an army crackdown Large pro-democracy demonstrations also were reported in several other cities. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, more than 300,000 people rallied on the waterfront of the <LOCATION> Huangpu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and 200,000 more gathered in the city's People's Square. The only violence reported was a clash between armed police and students in western <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday in which students said they were attacked with electric cattle prods. One student injured in the attack said 45 students were hospitalized. The thousands of students staging a week-old hunger strike in the 100-acre Tiananmen Square ended their fast Saturday, saying they needed to regain their strength in case troops moved in. Students and their supporters in the square early Sunday numbered about 200,000. Protests since the hunger strike began have drawn hundreds of thousands. The hunger strikers initially demanded a dialogue with the government on reform, to be broadcast live, and an apology for an initial official declaration that the student democracy movement was a plot against the party. But after Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> declared martial law in parts of the capital Saturday to put an end to the protests, most students and their supporters demanded <PERSON> Li </PERSON> resign. The army's move Sunday apparently was aimed at stopping the flow of tens of thousands of people to the capital to join the protests. Citizens blockaded the station by parking coal trucks across the road and hundreds of students sat in front of it as a further barrier. The army set up roadblocks around the capital about 12 miles from the city center, said a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source said 60,000 to 70,000 troops moved into the city center by subway Sunday and followed connecting tunnels to the walled palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the People on three sides of Tiananmen Square. The subway was closed to regular traffic as of noon Saturday. There was no outward sign of the reported troop presence in the city center and it could not be confirmed. Inside Tiananmen Square, the sun rose Sunday on a triumphant but weary and bedraggled crowd of at least 200,000 students, medical workers and ordinary citizens. The students spent the night sitting in rows with gauze wound around their mouths and noses for protection against a possible tear gas attack. Around the square and on roads throughout the city, citizens barricaded the way with buses, trucks and anything available. Thousands also surrounded tanks and trucks filled with soldiers at several points in the suburbs, immobilizing them. `` The people are strong,'' an elderly woman marveled as the long night ended peacefully. But soon after, five army helicopters swooped twice over the square as they did repeatedly Saturday, reminding the protesters the standoff was not over. The students waved and cheered defiantly. `` The danger is not over,'' said a medical student who was helping care for about 3,000 of the students who were weakened by the hunger strike. Student leaders had said over a loudspeaker Saturday night that the protesters should not resist if the army came. `` Our principle is peaceful non-resistance,'' they said. On Sunday, the student leaders held lengthy, private meetings to discuss their next step. Nothing was immediately announced. Some reportedly favored staying in the square while others wanted to join citizens confronting army vehicles. The widely ignored martial law regulations include bans on marches, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, speeches, the spreading of rumors, attacks on party, government or military organs and `` any other destructive actions.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s hard-line stand toward the students appears to have forced the resignation of the more liberal Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. Chinese sources said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, highly respected for his pioneering work in economic reforms, resigned his post after failing to persuade <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to compromise with the students. There has been no official word on <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s future. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s political victory could be brief, however, if the military refuses to cooperate in the crackdown. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Saturday urged that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government and demonstrators use `` restraint and moderation'' in the crisis. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> recommended that their citizens not travel to the country. Protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have demanded <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> retire. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, is widely admired for initiating market-oriented reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But he has come under sharp attack by students for holding onto power too long and letting political reform lag behind his economic reforms. The students began the protests on April 15 after the death of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a leading reformer who was ousted from his post for not cracking down on earlier student protests. The rallies gradually grew in size as workers and others joined in and evolved into the biggest show of defiance in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40 years of communist rule.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered the expulsion of 11 Soviets, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> responded by ordering eight British diplomats and three journalists out of the country for alleged espionage, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` It's a mirror-image act of retaliation,'' British Ambassador <PERSON> Rodric </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Roderic </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON>, the embassy's political counselor, said <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday night and told that 11 Britons would have to leave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> within 14 days. The previous day, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON> was called to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and told by Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretwell </PERSON>, the deputy permanent undersecretary, that 11 Soviets were engaged in `` activities incompatible with their status'' and must leave in 14 days, a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had not planned to make public the expulsions and did so only after the Soviets retalitated. The spokesman refused to say what the Soviets were accused of doing, but the charge he used of `` incompatible activities'' is diplomatic jargon for espionage. <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said the Britons ordered expelled from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were Embassy Second Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Second Secretary <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, Third Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, Vice Consul <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, Naval Attache Capt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, Assistant Naval Attache Lt.

The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> refused to identify the Soviets expelled. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ITN </ORGANIZATION> radio reported the Soviets were caught spying on military installations. Press Association, the domestic British news agency, quoted unidentified diplomats as saying those expelled from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> include Soviet journalists. The expulsions of British and Soviet nationals are the first since the two countries expelled 31 of each other's citizens four years ago. The 1985 dispute began when <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> ordered 25 Soviets to leave after they were identified as secret agents by Soviet defector <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordievsky </PERSON>. In addition to the 11 Britons ordered expelled Saturday, <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said three British diplomats who had already completed their tours of assignment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year were declared `` persona non grata'' by the Soviets, meaning they can not return. <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON> also was told Friday that three former staff members at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> could not come back to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said.

 Students occupying <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in violation of martial law said Sunday Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> ordered them to leave the square by dawn Monday or face a military attack. Troops occupied major state-run news organizations. Soldiers set up roadblocks around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, presumably to prevent more demonstrators from reaching the capital, and about 1,500 troops armed with automatic weapons moved into the train station. Troops occupied the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reporter said. Soldiers will be sent to major universities, which have been the center of the monthlong protests for democratic change, to `` keep order,'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> television reported. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> called the 27th and 28th armies into the capital Friday night and declared martial law in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday to put down the student-led protests that have drawn hundreds of thousands of people and caused major demonstrations in other cities. He did not say how many troops were called in. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, in a message to the independent student union that has led the protests for a free press, an end to official corruption and other reforms, said the military would clear <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> by force by 5 a.m. Monday if the students refused to leave, according to an announcement by the union. In a broadcast over the student loudspeaker system in the square, they also claimed <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> jails to be ready to accept a large number of students. `` We call on all of you to come stand with us,'' a student said after the announcement. `` The students are very weak and they need the people of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to help them. Even 200,000 people can not withstand the army.'' A Chinese source said 60,000 to 70,000 troops moved into the city center by subway and followed connecting tunnels to the walled palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the People on three sides of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. The subway was closed to regular traffic as of noon Saturday and remained closed Sunday. There was no outward sign of the reported troop presence and it could not be confirmed. Official media repeatedly broadcast a statement that troops were in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to restore order, not to suppress the students. But it was clear order could not be restored without moving the students from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. The widely ignored martial law regulations include bans on marches, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, speeches, the spreading of rumors, attacks on party, government or military organs and `` any other destructive actions.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s hard-line stand toward the students appears to have forced the resignation of the more liberal Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. Demonstrations in other cities continued Sunday. Tens of thousands of people marched in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, according to a Western resident, and police diverted traffic. Several hundred marched in the coastal city of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, a reporter at a local newspaper said. The military failed to make an expected attack Saturday night on 200,000 students and supporters who kept all-night vigil in Tiananmen Square. Many spent the night with gauze wound around their mouths and noses for protection against a tear gas attack and others slept on the hard stone pavement. Around the square and on roads citywide, citizens barricaded the way to <LOCATION> Tianamen </LOCATION> with buses, trucks, lightposts and anything else available. Thousands surrounded and immobilized tanks and trucks filled with soldiers throughout the city and in the suburbs. Local residents gave the soldiers cigarettes, food and water, and at one point Sunday 600 soldiers retreated several hundred yards. Troops set up blockades on highways into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to prevent more people from moving into the capital. Crowds in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> and the surrounding area thinned substantially Sunday, but people began flocking toward the square in the evening after <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s ultimatum was announced.

<TEXT>
 Five Syrian gunboats intercepted a freighter carrying supplies for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s besieged Christians and forced it to return to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said Sunday. The Syrians' use of their naval forces, along with intensified weekend shelling, marked a tightening of the blockade on the Christians' coastal enclave. The spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, identified the Lebanese-owned vessel as the Cedars and said it was intercepted at dawn Saturday as it was heading to a harbor near the northern city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sources say <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has based a flotilla of gunboats in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, which is Syrian-controlled, despite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s traditional control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline. It was the first known Syrian interception of a ship heading for the Christian enclave. Despite daily shelling of the Christian ports, several small freighters have made it through. Police said Syrian artillery in and around Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> pounded the enclave's coastline with 200 shells and rockets Saturday and Sunday in another violation of an Arab League cease-fire declared May 11. The bombardment, the heaviest since the cease-fire was called, targeted a 10-mile-long stretch of beach between the ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos, police reported. The Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies have been shelling the Christian ports to prevent ships with food or weapons from reaching the enclave. No casualties were reported in the latest attacks. At least 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded since fighting began March 8 between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian troops and the alliance of Syrian and Druse forces <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vying for power with a rival Moslem government, accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of sending reconnaissance jets on `` provocative runs'' over the enclave for the first time during the confrontation. He charged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s failure to challenge the Syrian penetration of what the Israelis consider their air force's preserve was `` evidence of a backstage understanding between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on maintaining their occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians have 40,000 troops with tanks deployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, mostly in Moslem territory, under an increasingly discredited 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies a border strip in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contends the Syrians have lost their credibility as peacekeepers by siding with the Moslem side. He has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians, whose forces outnumber his troops 4-to-1. The last known Syrian air force flights over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were in the early days of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claimed it shot down 80 Syrian jets over the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> then. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also charged that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies were bent on `` detonating a new security blowup in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' before an Arab summit Tuesday to discuss ways of ending <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. He said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> heads of state must not allow <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to `` swallow'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and he urged Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to intervene to stop the bombardment of the Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main arms supplier. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the pro-Syrian Cabinet, messaged <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders gathering for the summit that a Syrian pullout from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> can only be demanded by a unified Lebanese government.

 They huddled together, marched, debated and waited restlessly for an attack by their own army. When the sun rose Sunday, it showed a city physically and emotionally taxed by the first nervous night of martial law. Tiananmen Square, the majestic 100-acre expanse at the heart of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, was a garbage-strewn squatter camp for 200,000 students and supporters who spent the night in fear. Broad, tree-lined <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main east-west street, was littered with garbage and broken glass. Empty buses were parked across main intersections. Colorful flags that had been hung over the street to welcome Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week were ripped or torn down. All over the city, residents who spent the night guarding their streets against an expected troop advance began going home to rest. `` They'll come back at night,'' said a student who was among the students, medical workers and supporters occupying Tiananmen Square. Some curled up on the ground and tried to sleep, but most spent the night in anxious activity _ marching around the square, listening to student speeches and preparing for an attack. `` Obey the orders of the broadcast station,'' student leaders urged repeatedly over the loudspeaker system rigged in the square. `` Do not take any action without hearing it on the broadcast.'' Another broadcast warned to be careful when stepping on subway grates _ `` they might be electrified.'' Several thousand students from the <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mongolian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sat outside a nearby subway stop in case soldiers emerged from it. Students walked around with rolls of gauze hanging around their necks or around their heads, ready to be pulled over their noses and mouths in case of tear gas assaults. Despite the knowledge that troops had entered the city and were carrying tear gas, many people said they could not believe soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would attack their own countrymen. `` I do n't think anything bad will happen,'' said a student from the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Medical University No. 3 Hospital, who was in the square with hundreds of other medical workers to treat students who had been on a hunger strike. `` No one wants violence, the soldiers especially,'' he said. Student leaders announced that `` latest information'' said the troops would arrive at 2 a.m. Sunday. When the hour arrived, the students sat in rows facing outward and pulled their gauze into place. `` We ca n't fear for ourselves, we are fighting for the future of democracy,'' one student said through the mask. Off to one side, a woman with a megaphone tried to organize local residents to gather around the students. A man ran up crying, `` The soldiers are already in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>.'' Someone else reported tanks in his home district, about six miles from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. More than 300 motocyclists, many riding double, roared around the square every hour, honking their horns and leaving a cloud of exhaust fumes. Rumors flew. When no troops appeared at 2 a.m., the woman announced they were now expected at 4 a.m. The students, sensing they would not come, played <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s `` Ode to Joy'' over the loudspeaker system at 3 a.m. to express their relief. The sky lightened, and residents on nearby streets who had sat outside all night picked up their stools and went in. People who spent the night at intersections barricaded with lane dividers, street signs and anything else available began rubbing sleepy eyes and hopping on their bicycles to go home. `` We've won again,'' said one. In the square, students broke formation and began shoveling garbage into piles and nibbling on steamed bread. The loudspeaker played the official radio station's 6:30 a.m. newscast, which repeated the martial law order that took effect Saturday. When the newscast reported that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s government had resigned, some students cheered _ that is what they want their own government to do. Most regarded the rising sun as a temporary form of protection, but one <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student warned that soldiers could come by day, too. `` We ca n't relax, there's still danger,'' he said. As if to illustrate, five military helicopters swept into view and circled the square twice. The students stood, waved their arms and cheered. `` We're welcoming them,'' one said sarcastically.

 President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>'s patrician lineage and eloquent oratory satisfy a longing of his countrymen for a royal statesman who can skillfully temper their past sins with postwar achievements His rise from the shadow of his father's role in the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leadership to what is now the most respected federal office mirrors the stunning West German recovery from wartime ruin and testifies to the resilience of a modern family dynasty. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> will be re-elected without opposition Tuesday to a second term as head of state by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which meets every five years to elect a president. Each of the five political parties represented in the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to nominate a candidate, but for the first time in the nation's 40-year history, the vote will be uncontested. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, a member of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, has won endorsement of all but the far-left <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which nonetheless decided against running a challenger. The unusual unity displayed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s diverse and fractious political parties reflects the respect the 69-year-old <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> has won during his first term as president. In the latest nationwide poll, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allensbach </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> drew an approval rating of more than 85 percent. A man who by nature keeps above the political fray, <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> has transformed the mostly ceremonial office of president into an influential post of elder statesman and curator of a national conscience. His articulate address on the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II won praise worldwide as an effort to bring fellow Germans to terms with the Holocaust they perpetrated. `` Guilt is, like innocence, not collective, but personal,'' the president said. `` All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by its consequences and liable for it.'' But striking a chord of balance with West Germans weary of the shame bequeathed by their forebears, <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> also has called for a fair assessment of the accomplishments of his state built on the smoldering ruins of the Third Reich. Chapters of his own past have been a burden borne unflinchingly. Born in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> on April 15, 1920, to a titled family of intellectuals, <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> began his studies in 1937 at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, where he perfected the English he speaks fluently today, then joined <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army in 1938. He marched into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with his infantry regiment on the first day of World War II, lost a brother in the invasion and continued to serve until the German capitulation May 8, 1945. After resuming his law studies, he served as deputy defense council for his father, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, who was sentenced at the 1947 <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> trials to eight years in prison for his role as a deputy foreign minister in the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leadership. While <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> is generally revered by West Germans, critics can be found at both political extremes. Ultra-rightist leader <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, whose service in the Waffen SS continues to haunt his political career, complained recently that he is called to account repeatedly for the Nazi period while <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> `` has remained virtually untouched.'' Greens spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroerer </PERSON> said his party, which polls less than 10 percent, declined to support <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> `` more for what he has n't done than for any misdeed,'' contending the president could more actively address residual problems of discrimination and injustice. Some prominent Greens like <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Schily </PERSON>, however, have said they plan to vote for <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ingeborg </PERSON> <PERSON> Menz </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> office explained that the Federal Convention at which the president will be elected for a second and final term is made up of the 519 federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members and an equal number of delegates from the 11 state legislatures. An avid sportsman frequently pictured skiing or mountain-climbing, Weiszaecker is chosen most often as a model for young Germans, said spokesman <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Piel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Piel </PERSON> said West Germans respect <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> because of his image as a moral and noble statesman, allowing them to maintain an ersatz monarchy. The `` von'' in the family name stems from the title of baron bestowed on his grandfather in 1916 by the royal family of <LOCATION> Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>. After managerial stints in steel, banking and pharmaceuticals, <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> was head of the German <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> from 1964 to 1970. He served in the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 through his election as mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a high-profile post that propelled him into the presidency in 1984. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> has traveled frequently since his election, including making the first West German presidential visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1985, helping to mold the nation's affluent and sophisticated postwar image.

 For much of her life, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> has fought apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, sometimes the single lonely voice calling for reform.

<TEXT>
 Back in 1963, a legislator of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, who single-handedly represented the anti-apartheid opposition: `` Her days in Parliament are numbered.'' That would-be prophet, <PERSON> Cas </PERSON> <PERSON> Greyling </PERSON>, has since left <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, as has every one of his contemporaries except the indomitable woman he derided. Her days in office number some 13,200. Last week Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, 71, announced she will not seek re-election in September, ending a 36-year parliamentary career. Few politicians anywhere have served so long, in opposition to such an entrenched governing party, and fought so determinedly for their convictions. For 13 of those years, from 1961 to 1974, she was the only member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaking out against apartheid and campaigning for black rights. During a 15-week session in 1961, she made 66 speeches, offered 26 amendments and submitted 137 questions to parliamentary leaders. `` I do n't know how I made so many speeches,'' she said. `` I wrote every one myself _ that's why they were so lousy. They were not flowing speeches, but the contents have pleased me. When I look back at these speeches, I still think I have taken the right line.'' She has been lauded as `` the conscience of white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was among those saluting her last week. Yet despite the accolades, Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> departed only slightly from her customary modesty. `` Without actually saying, ` I told you so,' it has been a source of considerable satisfaction to have been in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> over the past 10 years, when many of the laws I opposed when they were introduced have been repealed,'' she told her colleagues Thursday. She referred to the repeal of laws prohibiting interracial marriages, reserving certain jobs for whites and requiring blacks to have permits to be in whites-only areas. The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented daily newspaper, said many blacks `` owe her gratitude for the battles she has fought.'' `` The great pity is that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> simply was not good enough to have a person such as herself as the head of state,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sowetan </ORGANIZATION> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> says her worst moment in Parliament came in 1966 when Prime Minister <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Verwoerd </PERSON> was fatally stabbed by a deranged assassin, a few yards away from her. P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, defense minister at the time and now president, told her as he rushed past: `` You liberals did this. Now we will get you.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> did not speak to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> for several years, and their relationship remains distant. They served together in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from 1953 until <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became president in 1985. In one exchange in 1981, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> warned her not to break the law, and she replied: `` I am not frightened of you. I never have been and never will be. I think nothing of you.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also will retire in September. One of Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>'s roles has been that of prophet. In 1981, referring to the unrest, she said: `` If it gets really bad, the government might suspend the law and rule by edict.'' In 1986, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> imposed a national state of emergency that remains in force. Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> predicted last week that blacks eventually will gain political rights and that remaining segregation laws will `` waste away'' or be repealed, `` though, alas, I will not be here to welcome their disappearance.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavronksy </PERSON>, daughter of Jewish immigrants from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. She enrolled at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> at 16, married physician <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> at 19, and later taught at <LOCATION> Witwatersrand </LOCATION> before running for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1952 from <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> district she has served ever since Militants in later years urged her to quit, saying a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that excluded blacks was no place for a genuine foe of apartheid. But she is convinced she played a vital role by `` keeping certain values alive.'' Her approach to politics was simple, she said last week: `` If you stick to basic principles, you do n't ever have to regret what you said.'' Other assessments of her career were less restrained. `` Only an extraordinary commitment to her political ideas could have carried her through the long years when she, alone, upheld the banner of civilization in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Business Day, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper. `` She held a torch aloft in time of darkness.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s students repeatedly have called for reforms over the past decade, but current pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities are by far the largest and boldest communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has faced. Student dissent has been gathering strength since senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> took power and initiated his policies of reform in the late 1970s. The first open challenge to the government came in the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79. The movement was so named because protesters wrote posters demanding freedom and complaining about a wide range of social ills and tacked them to a wall in western <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, seeking to wrest power held by leftists left over from the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, allowed the movement as long as it focused on the wrongs of the past. When criticisms began to hit closer to home, he cracked down. Dozens of dissidents were arrested, including <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for counterrevolutionary activities. <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> remains behind bars. The harsh measures effectively muffled democratic dissent for about five years. During the 1980s, students occasionally launched protests on their abysmal living conditions, the presence of factories and army troops on campuses, and crime, but they stayed away from political issues. In December 1984, for example, 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students marched on the university president's home to complain about unheated dormitories and an 11 p.m. lights-out policy. Dissent took a political turn in September 1985 when 1,000 students congregated at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to condemn what they said was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` economic invasion'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The authorities, disturbed when students shifted from criticizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to talking about rising food prices and government corruption, launched a propaganda campaign that stifled the unrest. But a little more than a year later, in December 1986, the students rose up again. In demonstrations and protests that spread to dozens of cities, students demanded greater campus autonomy, less bureaucratic control over their lives and a more democratic society. Tens of thousands flooded the streets of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students staged all-night marches to Tiananmen Square. The demonstrations ran their course in a month, and the government responded with a chilling campaign against `` bourgeois liberalization,'' or the attraction to Western liberal thinking. Three leading intellectuals, including astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, were purged from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly fomenting the unrest, and Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, regarded as sympathetic to the students, was ousted by party conservatives. The pro-democracy movement again went underground. It surfaced in June 1988 when 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students marched to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to protest the slaying of a fellow student by a gang of ruffians. Activists took advantage of the student anger to put up posters denouncing official corruption and demanding democratic reforms. The current explosion of protest was triggered by the death April 15 of former party chief Hu. Students took to the streets to mourn the man they feel was wronged by the party, but more importantly, to express again all they felt was wrong with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political system Mass protests have not been confined to students in the past decade. Farmers have protested pollution and official profiteering; unemployed youth have marched for jobs; and people sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution have demanded to be allowed to return to their city homes. Tibetans seeking independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have protested violently three times since October 1987, and the minority Uyghurs of far western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have demonstrated against nuclear testing in their region. This month, 2,500 Chinese Moslems, emboldened by the pro-democracy demonstrators, marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to demand the banning of a Chinese book they said blasphemed their religion. It was banned.

<HEAD>Consumers Urged to Use Electricity More Efficiently, Not Less</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, you can earn a $ 4 monthly credit on your electric bill by letting the utility cut power to your water heater for a few hours a few times a month. In southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, you can get a one-time cash rebate from the utility of up to $ 619 for replacing your air conditioner with a more efficient one. An <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> utility offers to knock $ 75 off your bill if you put a reflective film on your home's windows to block out the ultraviolet rays of the desert sun. Across the country _ with some stark exceptions _ electric utilities are pouring money into programs aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and shifting the use of electricity from the peak periods of demand to other times. `` There's a big move starting up,'' says <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON>, chairman of the energy conservation committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>. The main reason: Demands on the power supply system are growing so rapidly that utilities are nearing the point of having to invest in new sources of supply. The colossal failure of many past investments in nuclear power plants is a powerful disincentive to risk the billions needed for new construction. Virginia Power figures its program of interrupting power to 145,000 residential water heaters has saved it the need to add 150 megawatts of generating capacity _ the equivalent of a small power plant, says spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baab </PERSON>. Utilities in some parts of the country have been tinkering with electricity demand _ mainly to even out the daily and seasonal peaks and valleys _ for several years. But the trend is now accelerating as the utilities realize `` load management'' _ as it's called in the business _ can mean more profits Here's how: By encouraging customers to use less power in the peak periods of summer and winter and to use more the rest of the time, a utility can boost its overall electricity sales without having to add to its maximum generating capacity. `` The reason we're doing this is that it's just good business,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morron </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry association. For consumers, these programs can mean lower electric bills. The savings come not only from using more efficient appliances and heating and cooling systems but also from avoiding the rate increases that plant construction can bring. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, recently estimated the number of utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs had grown from 134 in 1977 to nearly 1,300 last year. He said this has allowed the industry to avoid adding 21,000 megawatts of new capacity over the past decade _ the equivalent of about 21 large generating plants. A single plant that size would be expected to cost at least $ 1 billion. After a decade of slow growth, electricity sales in the past two years jumped by about 5 percent a year. Experts differ on the outlook for future growth, but most agree demand could outstrip supply in the 1990s unless new generating capacity is added. This is a key reason for the emphasis now on efficiency gains and programs that can postpone the day when a utility must decide how to supplement its power supply. The trend is not uniform, however. Some utilities have a surplus of power and are aggressively peddling it. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is offering financial incentives for natural gas customers to convert their water heaters to electric and to buy heaters that will run electric as well as on oil or gas. `` We're loaded with power; the idea is to sell it,'' said <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bettiker </PERSON>, coordinator of residential sales for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>. `` We've never had a conservation program. Some of the utility programs are billed as conservation efforts, but increasingly the term `` efficiency'' is substituted to reflect the goal of stretching the use of each kilowatt-hour of power, rather than eliminating some uses. `` One of the tough nuts to crack is the customer's perception that conservation means deprivation,'' said <PERSON> Morron </PERSON>. `` Conservation does n't mean you have to put on a hair shirt and go live in a cave.'' Rather than being urged to turn down the thermostat in winter, consumers are being told they can save money and still stay warm by getting a more efficient heater. One of the most innovative utility programs is at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>. It hired an energy services company, <ORGANIZATION> Sesco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, to make efficiency improvements in about 11,000 residences. <PERSON> Sesco </PERSON> pays for the improvements _ such as attic insulation, window calking and lighting changes _ and the utility pays <PERSON> Sesco </PERSON> for measurable reductions in each home's electricity use. The deal is set so the utility is assured of paying less for the conservation than it would have paid to buy that amount of energy from an outside supplier, or to build a new power plant to generate the additional electricity. The utility customers pay nothing for the efficiency improvements and are expected to save $ 2 million in charges in the first year of the program. `` If all goes well, it's a win-win situation,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiaravalloti </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> spokesman. Although a growing number of utilities are starting or expanding conservation and efficiency programs, some experts say regulatory changes will be needed before the industry taps fully into the deep reservoir of savings potential. The key problem from the utilities' viewpoint is that most state regulatory agencies do not allow the industry to earn a profit on their investment in conservation. They are allowed to recover the cost, but no more. The result is that utilities may view increased conservation as decreased profits.

 Booze, inexperience and complacency conspired to cause the nation's worst oil spill, evidence and testimony suggest after a five-day federal investigative hearing that found plenty of blame to spread around. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill concluded Saturday. Board member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the agency's report probably will be issued in early 1990. The hearing came nearly two months after the tanker ran aground on a charted reef and ripped its hull open, bleeding nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into biologically rich Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The oil has coated hundreds of miles of coast and killed birds and marine mammals. `` There are any number of things that may have occurred, some mistakes that were made, and all those together may have been what led to the grounding of the Exxon Valdez,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. The 987-foot tanker was heading south from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> the night of March 23 with a load of Alaskan crude when Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> directed it across a northbound shipping lane to avoid chunks of ice from a glacier. The captain received <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> permission for the diversion. But without approval the ship continued beyond the traffic lanes. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> handed over control to <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gregory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cousins </ORGANIZATION> and left the bridge several minutes before the tanker ran aground at 12:04 a.m. March 24. In nearly 45 hours of testimony, not one of the 28 witnesses admitted doing anything wrong. But their testimony and more than 1,000 pages of evidence implicate the following players: _ <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who has been charged with operating the ship while drunk and declined to testify because of his pending criminal trial Testimony indicated he may have had a blood-alcohol level of 0.22 percent at the time of the wreck, five times the legal limit. Witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath before and after the wreck. The captain also left Cousins in charge, knowing he was not certified to pilot the ship through the sound. And <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had the tanker on automatic pilot although company policy restricts use of the device to open water. _ Cousins, who took the ship off automatic pilot 12 minutes before the crash but failed to turn the vessel away from <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> He testified that the ship did n't respond to his rudder changes, but an on-board recorder indicated his turns were simply too late. _ <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was aware of <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s alcoholism but said it was unaware he had resumed drinking after undergoing hospital treatment in 1985 Although the company president said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has a strict anti-drinking policy, employees testified they rarely saw evidence that the policy was enforced.

 Eight Republicans and three Democrats are fighting in party primaries to emerge from the shadow of Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, widely credited with pumping pride into a state that was long a favored target of standup comics. But <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a Republican who is barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term, remains a central figure in the campaign, especially among <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates who vying to inherit his mantle. A millionaire from an old and influential <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> family, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> won office in 1981 by the narrowest margin in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> history, defeating Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> by less than one-twelfth of 1 percent of the vote. By 1985, his popularity had soared and he won a second term by the widest margin in state history, getting 62 percent of the black vote and widespread support among labor and Democrats. While the national Republican party grew more conservative under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> advanced a moderate doctrine and urged the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to bring women, blacks and other minorities into its fold. He rose to national prominence, delivering the keynote address at the Republican National Convention last year and winning praise from Presidents <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his education initiatives. And he has been an unabashed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> booster, appearing on television commercials that tout the Garden State as an exciting place to visit _ a novel thought for most Americans. His popularity in a state where Democrats far outnumber Republicans makes him a tough act to follow. `` It's just like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trying to succeed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. You have enormously huge shoes to fill,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a Washington-based consultant who is running Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s campaign. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governor to use television to build a public image that reached beyond the state's borders Television is playing a crucial role in the primary, and candidates are spending millions to broadcast their messages in the nation's most expensive television markets. Although only about 400,000 members of each party are expected to cast primary ballots, candidates will pour more than $ 7 million into television advertising during the three weeks before the June 6 primary. When <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> took office, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> staggered under economic stagnation, high unemployment rates and serious budget problems. For most of his term, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> rode an economic boom. He doubled the size of the state budget during years when the treasury overflowed with $ 1 billion surpluses. But the good times came to an abrupt halt before the primary season. A predicted shortfall for next year grew to $ 500 million. Some budget analysts believe the gap could be as wide as $ 700 million. Soaring auto insurance rates have dominated the primary race, followed by debates over how to lower high local property tax rates and whether state taxes should be increased to solve the budget crisis. Growing traffic problems, congestion and the problems of managing rapid growth in the nation's most densely populated state also are big issues. Several of the candidates have likened themselves to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, former Attorney General <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> are close <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> allies. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> use <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s name in slogans that appear below their ballot lines, calling themselves `` Tom Kean Republicans.'' <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> are the most moderate candidates in the race. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadwick </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> have carved images as conservative Republicans. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, author of the federal Superfund law, is widely considered the virtually unbeatable frontrunner. Now in his third bid for the statehouse, he has run a low profile campaign, drawing criticism from his opponents for remaining silent on many key issues. In spite of the stacked political odds, liberal Assemblyman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>, daughter of Rep. <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., and the late <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, are running spirited Democratic campaigns Three other Republicans are running low-budget campaigns. They are former state tourism official <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blomquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolyer </PERSON>, an industrial arts teacher from <LOCATION> Matawan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Democrat Had Dairy Industry Investment While Pushing Dairy
Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> owned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time he was pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of some dairy farms, a review of records shows. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip and third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, became a limited partner in <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in December 1983, according to his financial disclosure forms. When he bought into the partnership with an investment valued at between $ 5,000 and $ 15,000, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> livestock, dairy and poultry subcommittee. He became chairman in 1985, a position he held for two years during the time the controversial 1985 farm bill was passed. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s financial dealings have been the subject of public interest since recent disclosures that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan official purchased a $ 100,000 bond for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> when the congressman was unable to come up with the money. Dairy Management Associates developed a computer software program for managing dairy herds, allowing farmers to determine things such as how much milk a cow produces and how much it eats, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s aides said. The program also is used by veterinarians. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> aide, said the congressman was `` comfortable enough in his mind to realize there was no potential for anything that he dairy or agriculture committee was going to pass that was going to impact directly on that investment.'' No law or rule prevents members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from holding assets that might conflict with their official duties. They are free to craft and vote on legislation that could affect their financial interests. White House officials and other executive branch employees, on the other hand, are barred under the basic federal conflict of interest law from taking government action in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest unless they obtain a waiver. The top penalty is two years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. In 1985, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and then-Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., introduced a bill that, among other things, would pay farmers not to produce milk at a time the industry was beset with The legislation, which drew the ire of consumer and milk-user groups, was described by <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> as a way to ease some producers out of dairying while retaining profitability for the rest. Ultimately, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation that called for modest cuts in the price support program, but authorized federally subsidized buy-outs of entire dairy herds. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled consumer lobby who fought <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> on dairy price support measures in 1985, said it stood to reason that if dairy farmers stay healthy they might be able to afford to buy computer software programs to manage herds. She said she had no idea of <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s investment at the time. One argument for exempting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from conflict-of-interest statutes is that lawmakers must publicly disclose their holdings so voters can decide whether an official is acting for personal enrichment. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> listed his holding as <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. In four following years, the entry was less descriptive. He simply stated on his financial disclosure forms that he had an interest in `` DMA -LRB- a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> limited partnership -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> put his assets, including his <ORGANIZATION> DMA </ORGANIZATION> interest, in a blind trust last June. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> does not fill out his forms personally and speculated that an aide called the company by its acronym, a pattern repeated annually. Partnership records on file in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ the most recent was Jan. 18, 1985 _ show <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s general partner in <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who formerly worked for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s accountant The company address was the same as the accountant's office in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s aide, said the congressman knew <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, but not He said <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> has not had an office for several years. Another limited partner in Dairy Management is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, the former aide to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s, resigned last week after an outpouring of criticism over a newspaper story detailing his attack on a woman in 1973.

<HEAD>Grassroots Concept Gaining Momentum in AIDS Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A novel, grassroots concept in drug testing pioneered by AIDS victims and their doctors is gaining momentum and soon may see its first victory with widely expected government approval of a treatment for a lethal AIDS-related pneumonia. Far from the ivory towers of academic medical centers, the testing is being conducted in a few inner cities hard hit by the disease where local AIDS doctors and their patients search together to find treatments that work and disgard those that do n't. These community programs _ the two major ones are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> _ were begun by AIDS patients and physicians frustrated by the slow pace of academic and government research to turn out a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and its deadly complications. `` People with AIDS just decided to do it themselves,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, which operates out of an old loft building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where participating doctors administer experimental therapies to AIDS patients. Research data gathered by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> group and the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on an aerosol version of the drug pentamidine pursuaded a <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee earlier this month to recommend approval of the treatment to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The lung ailment kills 60 percent of all AIDS victims. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is widely expected to approve aerosol-administered pentamidine shortly. Pentamidine was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> as an injectable drug five years ago to treat those already suffering from pneumocystis. Many doctors, though, administered it as a spray. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> expanded pentamidine's use in aerosol form as an experimental medication under government review. As a spray, the drug is delivered directly into the lungs where the pneumonia infection first shows up. In this form, pentamidine has been shown to help prevent pneumocystis infection. Advocates of the grassroots programs say the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee's action represents a major breakthrough for the concept of community-based research and recognition that primary-care doctors can produce solid, clinical data in the routine delivery of medical services to their patients. The result, they hope, will be to help get effective therapies to AIDS victims faster. Community programs reach more people, they say, and so will be able to bring more AIDS patients into clinical trials, and with more participation, there will be more information with which to assess the effectiveness of drugs. The concept has won the backing of many scientists, drug companies and the federal government, which is preparing to award $ 6 million in grants to develop community-based research programs throughout the country. In addition to the federal money, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in April gave $ 1.4 million to 16 community organizations starting reseach programs. Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> _ a cancer researcher, member of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s AIDS commission and now President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal physician _ avidly supports community-based research as an extension of the work going on in university and government centers. These programs, he said, are free of the `` inherent biases'' of academic studies to exclude the sickest patients. A more representative sampling, which community programs provide, produces better results and without any slippage in quality, since many academic researchers sit on the advisory boards of the community programs, he said. He credits AIDS activists for pointing out the weaknesses in traditional research. `` The communities have stepped up to bat and they have tried to speed up the system. They came up with a constructive idea and I think it's a good one,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. He added: `` I hope they -LRB- community-research programs -RRB- spread out into other diseases. I think it's an excellent model for testing cancer drugs, diabetes drugs, heart disease drugs and others.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, co-founder of Project Inform, a San Francisco-based AIDS education group, was an early proponent of community-based research and still supports it, but he says the movement has been `` romanticized.'' Few clinical trials are being done by community groups other than those in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and most of the efforts are spearheaded by doctors _ not AIDS patients _ and so are not really the symbols of patient empowerment that advocates describe them to be, he said. `` It's an important part of a broader puzzle,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's ever going to replace university-based research, and there's a limit to how big it can get because of the time it takes for doctors to participate.'' One mistake AIDS activists have made is in equating research with treatment, he said. `` The more pressure we put on the research process as being a way for treatment, the more we confound the research process, and the politicians find it a nice easy way out, instead of providing the money for health care,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. Yet, the movement is generating `` overwhelming'' interest, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Deyton </PERSON>, assistant director for community research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. When the government announced its $ 6 million program, it got more than 700 requests for information about it. <PERSON> Deyton </PERSON> declined to say how many applied by the April deadline, but a <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was more than 60. <PERSON> Deyton </PERSON> estimated that as many as a dozen community-based groups are now involved in clinical trials for AIDS therapies. With more trials, he said, there would likely be more participation by Hispanics, blacks, intravenous drug users and women, who are now underrepresented in clinical testing.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-largest opposition party elected a new chairman Sunday to succeed the party leader who resigned in an influence-peddling scandal. <PERSON> Koshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishida </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s new leader, told members, `` I will fight to make the <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> once more a party that is clean and trustworthy.'' <PERSON> Ishida </PERSON>, 58, previously one of four party vice chairmen, was elected to succeed <PERSON> Junya </PERSON> <PERSON> Yano </PERSON>, who resigned last week when prosecutors began formal questioning of a Komeito member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> of Komeito and <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were interrogated by police last week. They are suspected of taking bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate. The so-called Recruit scandal has resulted in 14 bureaucrats and businessmen being arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who has acknowledged receiving political contributions from Recruit, announced last month he was resigning to take responsibility for the scandal. But his party has yet to find a successor who commands widespread respect and is untainted by the scandal. <PERSON> Yano </PERSON> himself was under fire in <LOCATION> Komeito </LOCATION>, the second-largest opposition party after the Socialists, for links to an earlier insider-trading scandal. More than 600 party members, including 56 members of the 512-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and 23 members of the 252-seat House of Councilors, attended the special party convention in downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ishida </PERSON> urged fellow party members to reflect on a `` lack of seriousness'' among members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The new party leaders, he said, must examine the scandal and reform the party. `` I believe this is the way to win public confidence,'' he said. Though as an opposition legislator <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> had no official power, he repeatedly lodged questions in Parliament that prosecutors saw as helpful to Recruit, and he gained financial benefits from Recruit share transactions. Recruit sold bargain-priced, unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 160 influential politicians, aides, bureaucrats and businessmen, allegedly in an attempt to gain influence in the government. When public trading in the shares began, their prices soared and buyers made large profits. <PERSON> Ishida </PERSON> was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1967.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> have finally come home after nearly a year in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, now that a man has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1985 terrorist murder of their son. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, 23, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, was shot and his body dumped onto the pavement at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> during the 17-day hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847. The Stethems, both 53, attended 65 court sessions in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, beginning last July, for the trial of <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON>. `` Nearly a year out of my grandchildren's lives,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said. The Stethems returned to their <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> home Thursday night after <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON>'s sentencing. `` We're very confident and really feel he'll stay behind bars,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON>. `` So we feel our trip was worth it.'' `` They say time heals all wounds,'' <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said. `` The pain has n't healed yet. And I do n't see it happening at this point. But this verdict has helped a lot.'' The first order of business was working in their yard and tending the rose garden Mrs. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> maintains to harvest flowers for her son's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. A neighbor mowed the lawn while the Stethems were away, but a three-week lapse and abundant rain have given it time to grow knee-high. `` We must get on with our lives now,'' said <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` We do n't feel in any danger. We've been victims already ... We'll never have <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> back.'' In the garage is their son's car, with a vanity license plate <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> obtained after his son was killed. `` ROBBIES,'' it says. `` We do n't drive it much,'' <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said. The elder <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 when he was 17. He retired in 1979 but later returned as a civilian employee. Mrs. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> also was in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, when they met. She now is a secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There are three other children: <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON>, 31, a mother of two, and two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sons, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, 23. `` I had actually tried to talk all of them into joining the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' their father said. When the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airplane was hijacked in June 1985, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was part of a crew of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers returning from a routine maintenance job at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sewage treatment plant in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. They were on their way back to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> now holds the same job his brother did. Why <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was chosen for execution by the Shiite Moslem terrorists remains unknown. Another diver, severely beaten at the same time, lived to testify at <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON>'s trial. Two terrorists involved in the hijacking remain at large. Although the time they spent at the trial in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did not provide answers to all their questions, the Stethems derived a certain solace. `` I had to be there,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said. `` I had to know what was happening. I would've climbed the walls wondering what was happening if I stayed at home.'' During breaks in the trial, she did volunteer work, typing at the dental clinic of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base where they stayed. `` A lot of nights, I did n't sleep and walked around and called my daughter'' in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, she said. Her husband said he read a lot of books about terrorism. A security detail whisked them into the courtroom, which was inside a prison, and they sat with the prosecutor behind bulletproof glass. An interpreter translated. Now that they're home, the <PERSON> Stethems </PERSON> plan to visit their son's grave, taking newly cut roses from the garden and news of what happened to <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON> `` This is going to be great, going this time,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said, `` because I can tell him we just got one.''

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> helped assemble cars for 16 years until he lost his job. Now he's helping former co-workers rebuild their lives. `` We've all been kicked in the teeth,'' said <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, 34. `` Now it's time to get up and go.'' <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> was a chief steward at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> until the company ended car production in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> last December, laying off more than 5,000 workers. The <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> factory complex, obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> as part of its 1987 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had been used for automaking for 86 years. In his new job as a career counselor, <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> is part of a network that is leading people to new jobs and trying to create employment opportunities. Some former workers say they realize the new jobs will pay far less than they earned at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, but they have to do something because unemployment benefits begin to evaporate in the next month. `` People are starting to get a little more desperate,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 35, an ex-autoworker. `` People were relaxed at first because we had such a good benefits package.'' In addition to regular unemployment compensation, the package included a $ 20 million `` job bank'' from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> that paid full salary to 2,200 senior workers for about three months. Workers with less seniority drew money from a `` sub-pay'' fund that provided $ 2,400 to each person. `` It's soon going to get to the point where the shoe really starts pinching,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> established at the local <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. More than 2,000 former autoworkers have sought help at the assistance center, and about 300 have landed new jobs so far, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The center is staffed by other former <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> employees who have been trained to be counselors. The center has computer access to job openings in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. It also guides people to training programs at a technical school and provides a workshop where people can improve their math and English skills. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 42, said that after brushing up her education, she hopes to get a civil service job. She had a chance to go to a Chrysler plant in <LOCATION> Belvidere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, along with about 200 other former <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> autoworkers, but she and her husband did not want to leave their home. In the meantime, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said she is coping with tight finances, although she says her unemployment benefits will continue until around July. `` We do n't go out anymore,'' she said. `` We do n't go out to a movie, bowling or even a tavern.'' Some people have started showing signs of alcohol or domestic problems, said said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiken </PERSON>, who helps run a `` listening post'' at the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> headquarters so laid off workers can receive emotional support. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is assisting in local economic development. `` We're not out of the picture,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executive assigned to the effort. He noted that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is still <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>'s largest employer, with about 1,200 people working at the company's engine plant. Workers, state and local officials expressed betrayal when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced the December shutdown in January 1988, saying they believed the company had promised to continue production into the 1990s. The state even threatened to sue, but accepted a settlement that included the creation of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s position for one year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also donated vacant buildings for office and manufacturing space, and diverted profits from 1988 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> car sales into a trust fund to help laid off workers with living expenses. The fund totals more than $ 23 million. `` The crisis part of it is over,'' said <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who noted that officials prepared to deal with the shutdown before it occurred. `` This was an unusual plant closing. Normally you do n't know about it a year ahead of time.''

<TEXT>
 Three candidates are running in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s first Republican gubernatorial primary in 40 years, vying for the chance to oppose Lt. Gov <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> in his bid to be the nation's first elected black governor. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Republicans, eager for victory after two straight shutouts for the statehouse, hold a primary June 13 in hopes of stirring more voter interest than a convention would attract. `` I do n't see any signs that the gamble is paying off,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>. The state party chairman disagrees. `` I think we're dominating the news,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>. `` We're getting noticed, and that's what it's all about. The three candidates have held 11 public debates that have garnered statewide attention, the last one Wednesday. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is unchallenged for the nomination, with selection set for the party convention June 9 and 10. By law, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> can not serve a second consecutive term. The Republican primary candidates are: _ Former state Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 46, who lost to Democrat <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> in 1981, was squeezed out when he started talking about another bid for governor in 1985 and then sought but failed to get the nomination for lieutenant governor. _ Rep. <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, 59, is a former state legislator who touts his experience in state and federal office. An unsuccessful contender for the gubernatorial nomination in 1985, he never has run in a statewide race. _ Former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 42, who did not seek re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat last year. <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> is the front-runner in the contest, according to polls, but his lead may be narrowing. <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> say <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> gave up his seat rather than face <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, who won in a landslide over a little-known candidate. All three stress the goals of boosting education and fighting drugs. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has issued a blanket pledge not to raise taxes. <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said he ca n't rule out any tax increase in four years. <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> has refused to make a no-tax pledge. The polls show <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> favored in a head-to-head contest with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who won the state's No. 2 office in 1985 with 52 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is about even with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> trails the Democrat. Republican national chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has made the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> gubernatorial campaign a key test for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm going to come down here every week if I have to and do everything I can,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> fund-raiser earlier this month. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carried the state last year with 60 percent of the vote. Democrats have captured <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s electoral votes only twice since the end of World War II _ in 1948 and 1964. State Republicans last tried a gubernatorial primary 40 years ago. The most successful primaries for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> have been those conducted by the opposition. In 1969, a three-way <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary badly split the party and led to the election of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s first Republican governor since Reconstruction, <PERSON> Linwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Holton </PERSON>. In 1977, another Democratic primary set up a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> victory when former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> staged an upset victory over Attorney General <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in June. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> lost that fall to Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>. After 1977, the Democrats stopped holding primaries and started winning elections _ in 1981 with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> and 1985 with <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. `` When the Democrats quit the primary, a Democrat got elected,'' <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON> said. `` I think there's a connection there.''

 The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> flag now flutters over a former boarding school seized last week by state officials who plan to make it a prison. But on trees nearby are tacked homemade signs depicting a cow in prison stripes and one word: `` Never.'' And there is still talk at the general store of stopping the state from building a 500-inmate medium-security prison in this isolated town of 800 people and more than twice as many dairy cows. It all started in 1983, when the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> shut its doors and state officials decided to turn the building into a prison for drunken drivers. The project did n't go through and the prison was built instead in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, 40 miles away, but that was n't the end of the story. `` They came back with the regular prison,'' said <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON>, chairwoman of the town Board of <LOCATION> Selectmen </LOCATION>. To the state, the former Seventh Day Adventist boarding school perched on a windswept ridge is a place to build a badly needed prison without having to start from scratch. The 240-bed first phase of the prison, which the state hopes to complete in 18 months, is expected to cost about $ 25.6 million, including renovations at the school, said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state Division of Capitol Planning. The second construction phase is expected to cost $ 20.4 million, <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> said. For the townspeople it's a battle to preserve the rural way of life in this little one-store hamlet, where the road in front of <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> is blocked for 20 minutes twice a day while a farming family moves its cows to and from the barn for milking. It's the sort of place where the main road is a country lane squeezed between stone fences marking pastures that were cleared when the nation was young. Where the town crew waits for the snow to stop before plowing, even if it takes days. `` We do n't sit down and strategize how we are going to convince people we will be good neighbors, but we will be talking with them,'' said <PERSON> Deodato </PERSON> <PERSON> Arruda </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. She said eight armed corrections officers would be stationed at the prison around the clock. But <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, co-owner of the general store and president of a citizens group fighting the prison, said the locals will not be won over. `` I do n't think there is any chance of that happening,'' she said. `` They have n't dealt with us fairly at any time in the past three years.'' The town appropriated $ 100,000 last year _ one-fifth its budget _ to fight the prison. Two lawsuits challenging the site-selection process are pending in the courts. The owners of the school property also are fighting back, promising to challenge the eminent-domain process by which the state seized the property. They say the $ 5.25 million pricetag the state has placed on the 730-acre property is not nearly enough. <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiar </PERSON> bought the academy with <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> psychiatrist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> in 1985 for $ 3.2 million. The men had hopes of turning it into a psychiatric hospital, but a year later they offered it to the state for $ 10 million. `` I wish I had never bought the property. It's been a lot of aggravation,'' he said. The state Inspector General blasted the state's handling of the matter in a report. He suggested that bumbling alone delayed the prison at least 18 months and, in some cases, exacerbated the controversy. Inspector General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Baressi </PERSON> said an environmental study that was to have cost $ 75,000 ended up costing $ 645,000. The town has charged in a lawsuit that the report did not adequately address environmental issues.

 The government on Sunday said it is still dissatisfied with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for solving a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> rift over whether to hold superpower talks on short-range nuclear missiles. But government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was confident the issue can be resolved before a May 29 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Referring to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compromise proposal brought back by Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> after a visit Friday to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said: `` I think it forms the basis for a solution, but a solution has not yet been found. `` The discussions are continuing,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. He declined comment on what obstacles remained. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would send President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a letter detailing the government's position on Monday and that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would call <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders to discuss the matter in coming days. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> briefed reporters after <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met for two hours with <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been pressing for prompt superpower talks on the missiles. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration orginally had flatly rejected such talks. The disagreement has caused <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members to choose sides in the dispute and clouded plans for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. Under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compromise plan, negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons would be linked at some indefinite point to talks now under way in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> designed to reduce conventional forces, such as tanks. The short-range talks would not be held until the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sizable reductions in its conventional forces, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says far outnumber <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces. Acceptance of short-range negotiations at all represents a major concession by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. For months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had ruled out any negotiations on the missiles, saying they were essential to the defense of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In return, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to relent in its demands for `` speedy'' negotiations and state firmly that it rejects the immediate elimination of short-range weapons. Government sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the obstacles to agreement centered on the latter provision, the so-called `` third zero option'' under which short-range missiles would be immediately scrapped. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterproposal also envisioned postponing until 1992 a decision on deployment and production of missiles that are faster and travel farther than the Lance missiles. Amid a wave of disarmament feeling in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has resisted a plan to upgrade the U.S.-made Lance missiles deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> against the Soviet-led forces. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wants to delay any decision to deploy the new missiles until at least 1992, after next year's national elections. All major West German political parties are united in the demand for negotiations out of concern their country is the likeliest battlefield in the event of a nuclear war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Asked to Order Release of Computer Tapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge is expected to rule soon on efforts of researchers to gain access to computer tapes that could shed new light on the Iran-Contra affair and other backstage dealings in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> has asked for written arguments by Thursday on whether some decisions by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to block access to the tapes are subject to court review. The government is asking for a summary judgment that would in effect dismiss the claims of the National Security Archive and others for access to the computer messages. The National Security Archive is a private repository of government information operated as a division of The Fund for Peace, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> non-profit organization. Other plaintiffs include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. They say the tapes contain information that does not exist anywhere in paper form. At issue in the case are backup tapes containing messages sent on the Professional Office System, known as PROFS, in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies in the Executive Office of the President. Printouts from the tapes were used by the presidentially appointed <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the congressional Iran-Contra committees in their investigations of the affair that rocked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. They were also introduced as evidence in the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was convicted of aiding and abetting in the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, shredding and altering documents and accepting a gratuity. The plaintiffs say there are more, 144 tapes in a system used by 100 to 150 people on the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff, and 32 in a system used by more than 300 in the Executive Office of the President, and that such messages are routinely destroyed. `` The fundamental issue in this case is whether the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EOP </ORGANIZATION> may authorize the routine destruction of information generated on the PROFS computer systems without complying with the requirements of the federal records laws,'' attorney <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, representing the plaintiffs, told the judge in a memorandum. `` Plaintiffs' argument confuses the medium with the message,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys replied. `` PROFS is simply a tool for conveying information.'' The government takes the position that the system is a substitute for calling a colleague on the telephone or talking with him or her in a hallway. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told the court that `` the bulk of the information generated on that system is transitory and does not constitute record material.'' It said users of the system have been instructed repeatedly to make a printout of any information that legally amounts to a government record. Ms. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, on the other hand, argued that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> and executive office `` have made a blanket determination that, except in rare instances, the information generated on the PROFS systems is simply not covered by any of the federal records laws.'' If the judge denies the government's motion for summary judgment, Ms. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said the plaintiffs will file a motion to obtain additional information they need in order to show that `` the defendants have violated those laws by routinely deleting and ultimately deciding to destroy the information that existed on the PROFS system at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' Defendants in the case include <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the archivist of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who the plaintiffs accuse of `` failing to exercise proper oversight of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> EOP </ORGANIZATION>'s routine destruction of information generated on the PROFs system.

 American television networks continued to report from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over the weekend, but in most cases without that important component of television coverage _ pictures. `` We're now on the basis of hand-carrying everything out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, who left for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after the network's live coverage was shut down Friday night in the middle of the season finale of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.''

Tension was increasing Sunday as troops were rumored to be readying a move on the protesters. `` There's no question that we're handcuffed by not being able to broadcast live,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where he remained on Sunday. `` The government can pull the plug on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> to keep the story from getting to the world, but we are not their problem. ... If they do n't pull the telephone plugs, and I expect them to do that, we'll be able to get word out.'' Network television coverage had for days brought Americans inspiring pictures of the remarkable uprising. On Friday, the government got fed up and ordered coverage to cease. The networks broke in live to cover that development, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> even taking its cameras into <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s control room in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` Dallas'' viewers got an unexpected, real-life cliffhanger when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> broke in with scenes of Rather attempting to negotiate with Chinese officials. `` I do protest, in the most respectful manner,'' Rather said, to no avail. He reluctantly signed off one last time as a technician in the background shut off the satellite dish. `` I loved the fella who called in and said, ` I was watching <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' broke in,''' Rather joked in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Saturday. There were some calls of complaint from `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' viewers. But taking to the air was a matter of being able to broadcast the most recent <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> footage _ dramatic scenes of demonstrators being beaten by police. `` The object became to delay it as long as we possibly could,'' Rather said of the halt in coverage. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a society where authority is everything. That's why I kept asking for something in writing.'' Rather's coverage from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> had been shut down earlier. As he rushed back to the hotel, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON>, director of special events, was on the air arguing in a hotel corridor with two uncomfortable-looking Chinese officials. `` The scene in the control room and in the hallway was just bizarre. I was stalling to get fed everything we had coming in to us,'' said <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON>, also in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` I was using every ploy I could, including getting them to put it in writing. I knew he -LRB- Rather -RRB- was on his way back.'' Rather said the breakneck ride back to the hotel included a collision with one of the many bicycles clogging the street, but no one was hurt. Meanwhile, at <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> went on live as executive producer <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Miran </PERSON> vainly negotiated with Chinese officials. `` I certainly was angry,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> recalled. `` I tried not to show that on the air. My object was to disgorge the last information we have. But to have your pencil, your notepad, your microphone and your camera snatched out of your hands is very disturbing.'' `` There was frustration, but also a sense of, I do n't know if pride's the right word, but just knowing that what you're doing is right,'' said <PERSON> Miran </PERSON>, also still in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` There were very mixed emotions, because on one hand, you want to stand up and scream about freedom of the press. On the other hand, that does n't mean anything here.'' When his arguments at one point had flustered a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official, <PERSON> Miran </PERSON> recalled, `` he said, ` This is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.' In his mind, that explained everything.''

 There were tall ones, shorts ones; chubby ones, skinny ones; noisy ones, quiet ones. The 600 boys and girls looked perfectly ordinary, but they had one thing in common: all were test-tube children. They gathered in the sunshine Sunday with their balloons and ice creams for a reunion at the clinic one might call their birthplace. The guests ranged from infants a few weeks old to 11-year-old <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the world's first test-tube child. They released 1,295 yellow balloons, one for every test-tube baby conceived at <ORGANIZATION> Bourn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. They posed on the lawn for a group photograph, and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> planted a walnut sapling in memory of the late <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, the man who co-founded the clinic and pioneered the test-tube baby technique. `` Never before have so many test-tube babies been gathered together in one place at one time,'' declared medical director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinsden </PERSON>, in a speech welcoming <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s progeny. `` You are the message of hope for other people around the world.'' More than a decade has passed since <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s birth in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on July 25, 1978 heralded the dawn of what became known as in vitro fertilization, or IVF. The technique invented by <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, involves removing the egg from the mother's ovary, fertilizing it with sperm in a dish, and returning the egg to the womb to grow into a normal embryo. For women who could not conceive because of such afflictions as blocked fallopian tubes, IVF was their salvation. But it remains difficult, painful and expensive, and only some 10,000 babies worldwide have been born by IVF. `` So many of you suffered pain, anxiety, stress, tension, and then fortunately all of you had joy and happiness,'' <PERSON> Brinsden </PERSON> told the parents gathered outside the clinic. `` So it was worthwhile for you,'' he said. `` But I'd like you just to bear in mind that for every one of you, there are seven or eight or nine others who have not been as fortunate as you. So let us think today also of the people who have not been as lucky,'' Among the children enjoying the jugglers, brass band and Punch and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> show, was <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s first test-tube child, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Iordanidou </PERSON>, 7. Standing with <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> and her parents was another Greek couple, <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diamanto </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsellos </PERSON>, and their 4-year-old test-tube son <PERSON> John </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marsellos </PERSON> said she had only one fallopian tube and it was blocked. The couple visited <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctors who told her nothing could be done. Then after hearing about <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Iordanidou </PERSON> on television, they visited <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` Dr. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> accepted us,'' said <PERSON> Marsellos </PERSON>. `` I said, ` all over the world we were told there was no hope. What makes you so sure you can help?' and Dr. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> said something I will never forget. He said: ` Your case is one of the most difficult cases, and we accept difficult cases.''' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has entered her pre-teens thoroughly at ease with fame. Wearing a pink dress and white ribbon in her long, golden hair, she faced the cameras patiently while her parents fielded reporters' questions. `` I think the party's absolutely marvelous. I never thought when <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> was born that we would one day see so many children. It's lovely,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 41 <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a 48-year-old truck driver, said the couple often receives letters from parents of test-tube children, asking whether such children need anything special for their upbringing. `` We just say, do the natural thing; bring up the children,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> have a second test-tube daughter, 6-year-old <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> died last year, but <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was at the party and used the opportunity to deliver an impassioned appeal for more research and financing for techniques of assisted conception. `` When you think that maybe one couple in 10 is infertile, we've got a lot of work to do,'' he said

<TEXT>
 A former press secretary to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contends in a new book that the 1988 presidential candidate was an abusive and sexist boss who was `` incessantly critical and totally egocentric.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s press secretary for about two months in early 1988, describes being shoved from behind by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and says the candidate literally stepped on her toes to show his displeasure on several occasions. `` He abused me and most other staff members in countless ways,'' she writes. <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>'s account of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s unsuccessful campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination is `` The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Phenomenon: The Man, the Power, the Message,'' being published June 26 by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to comment on her descriptions of him or incidents <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> recounts, saying he had not read the book. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in an interview, disputed the notion <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> was a campaign insider. He said she worked as his traveling press secretary for only five weeks and left about the time of the `` Super Tuesday'' round of Southern primaries. `` <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> was with us for about five weeks,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Some of that time she spent moving to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and then she got sick. And she left around or before Super Tuesday ... -LRB- when -RRB- our campaign was just really getting started. `` I do n't know why I should either read or react to that,'' he said. Asked if he wanted to read the book, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` It's not a priority.'' <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, in an interview, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was `` totally wrong'' about her length of service and said her illness was only a brief flu. She said in the book that she worked as press secretary from Jan. 24 until March 28, when she was informed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> no longer wanted her on the road with the campaign. She became a consultant to the campaign on April 4 and remained until mid-June. She said she was relieved by the move, and much of her book is devoted to descriptions of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delivering `` constant unwarranted abuse'' to her and other staffers, sometimes in public. `` The reality for me was that it was very unpleasant to be around someone who was incessantly critical and totally egocentric to the extent that no one else mattered at all,'' she writes. `` It was also frightening. I knew it would become very difficult for me to defend my position as this man's press secretary. At first I believed in him. I still believed in most of his issues, but I could no longer throw my heart behind the man as I had at the beginning.'' She said she believed her personality irritated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s treatment of women did not match his public support for women's rights. Female staff members, she wrote, `` were fully aware that they were treated as second-class citizens by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' She describes entering a news conference following a debate with other Democratic candidates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and says <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> first asked her to check on the scene, then pushed her when he saw television cameras on other candidates. `` As I began walking in to check the scene to report back to him, I suddenly felt my breath being knocked out of me from behind. It was <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s fist smashing into my back. He was pushing me aside and snarling in my ear, ` Get the ... out of my way,''' she wrote. She said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deliberately stepped on her feet as she talked to reporters aboard the campaign jet. `` He stepped squarely on my feet, and it hurt,'' she wrote. `` I was so shocked that I figured it must have been an accident, but several more times convinced me, sadly, that he'd done it on purpose to signal me to quit talking.'' <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carraway </PERSON>, who directed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, said in an interview that <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> frequently dropped off <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s traveling party for personal reasons and was given a Washington-based job that allowed her to begin writing her book while still on the campaign payroll She said <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> never came into the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> campaign office.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces a `` last chance opportunity'' to reform <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement, according to two congressmen who recommend reinforcing the authority of an acquisition czar and simplification of current regulations. Reps. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the panel's subcommittee on investigations, also suggested a system of rational tradeoffs between military requirements, cost and performance, and training for procurement personnel without reliance on `` If reform is to occur, the implementation must be specific and measured, and not simply the expression of a philosophical statement,'' the congressmen said in a four-page letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> will be submitting to the president sometime soon a defense management review, which will include proposals based on the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> report, the lawmakers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> studied ways to reform the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s system of buying weapons <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> proposed a `` checklist of critical actions'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to consider, including clarifying the authority of the undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition and establishing a better relationship between the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the Joint Requirements Operational Committee. An improved relationship of the three organizations which oversee the defense budget, acquisition and requirements would result in `` checks and balances that will promote the planning, scheduling and budgeting that produces tradeoffs.'' `` For those of us who have worked on this issue the last three years _ attempting to create a ` cultural change' within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> _ this current effort to make acquisition reform work is a last chance opportunity,'' the congressmen said. Last summer, allegations of fraud and corruption in the procurement process rocked the Pentagon.

<TEXT>
 Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday for the trial of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> on a misdemeanor charge of having sex with a 16-year-old girl. If convicted, the 58-year-old Republican could go to jail for up to six months. Also weighing in the balance is the political future of the four-term congressman who has survived other allegations during his career. Five days before the start of the trial, a 35-year-old sexual molestation case involving <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was brought to light by a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> television station. <ORGANIZATION> WJBK </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, then a salesman, was taken in for questioning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1954 on suspicion he had sexually molested a young girl. The station, citing unidentified police sources, said the case was dropped because the child's parents refused to press charges. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> report, other than to say there was no case. He also would n't talk about the trial, saying the details will be used in his defense. He has said he is innocent. `` He's going to let it work out in the proper forum, and that is a court of law,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangini </PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor who is handling the case, expects the trial to last no more than a week. The case drew national attention when a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> television station on Feb. 1 broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that showed <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> apparently offering a government job to the mother of the 16-year-old after she asked him why he was `` messing around'' with her daughter. <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> said it recorded the Nov. 11, 1988, meeting at a fast-food restaurant a day after <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> approaced the station with her story. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> told Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, who wore a concealed microphone, that he thought her daughter was an adult, according to the videotape. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reviewed the tape and said it found no evidence of bribery or extortion. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was indicted Feb. 23 on a charge of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child. The misdemeanor charge stemmed from the allegation that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who is divorced, had sex with the girl in his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last year. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> refused to discuss the accusations against him for three weeks following the first reports of the allegations. He made his first public comment on the day of the indictment, issuing a statement proclaiming his innocence. He has vowed to serve out his term, which expires in 1990. Several Republicans have indicated an interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' seat should the political opportunity arise. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> has raised about $ 20,000 for his defense, which <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said is expected to cost about $ 60,000. One event in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> produced $ 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and served two terms before he was barred from seeking public office for five years for not filing campaign reports on time. That election law was changed before the five-year period expired, and he was appointed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 to fill an unexpired term. In 1974, while in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he fought allegations that he accepted $ 1,000 in campaign contributions from <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Tongsun </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> during his first stint on Capitol Hill. He denied the charge, presenting the results of a voluntary lie detector test. He returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and was re-elected last November. In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was stricken with throat cancer. He has undergone six operations, radiation therapy and treatment with an experimental drug that left him with a raspy voice and a chronically dry mouth. He said the cancer is in remission.

 The 17-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories appears to be at a crossroads, with both Palestinians and Israelis threatening to escalate the use of force. In their latest leaflet, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> underground leaders vowed to kill an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier or settler for every Arab killed by Israeli troops. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army is on the offensive against Palestinian unrest, killing 33 Arabs and wounding 435 so far this month. The government also has increased economic pressure, putting the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s 700,000 Palestinians under curfew for eight days and requiring permits to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Palestinian leaders have so far persuaded protesters to use just bottles and stones in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. But with 496 Arabs killed since the uprising began in December 1987, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> intellectuals say there is growing pressure to use guns. `` The ground is shaking under those who urge restraint,'' said a prominent Palestinian. He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he feared arrest if he spoke openly. `` There is a feeling among some young activists that the only way to make the Americans force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make policy changes is for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to pay a higher cost, to send Israelis back in coffins,'' he said. Concurrently, there is growing pressure from Israeli right-wingers, led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, to use whatever force is necessary to crush the violent protests. How far <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would actually go in using military force remains to be seen. But one official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> needs to widen the battlefield and use `` administrative violence'' to hit Arabs in the pocketbook and other aspects of day-to-day life. `` We need to fight in all fields of life, not just the streets,'' he said. Such action, the official said, would persuade Palestinians to adopt a more realistic view of possible political settlements and give up militant nationalist aspirations. The crackdown on Palestinian workers is especially severe since wages from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which were $ 700 million in 1987, accounted for about one-third of the occupied territories' gross national product. About 50,000 of the 700,000 Palestinians from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and 60,000 of the 1 million <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On the Palestinian side, there have been several signs of escalating violence. On Friday, for the first time, there was a gun battle between troops and armed Palestinians. One soldier died and three Arabs were killed. Palestinians also have stepped up killings of suspected army collaborators. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, that Palestinians may be forced to use arms if Israeli forces continue to kill <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> demonstrators. And in an interview with the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> figure, called for the use of firearms. `` We are convinced that diplomacy has a time and the stone has a time, but I see that the time nas now come to use arms in support of the intefadeh,'' he was quoted as saying. But there are questions whether Palestinians would use arms or whether such threats are rhetoric to make <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> back away from hard-line policies. <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>, a retired general and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military governor in 1974-76, said Palestinians lack adequate weapons to mount an effective guerrilla war. He said Palestinians risk harsh Israeli reprisals if they fight with firearms. Palestinian moderates have expressed concern the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would abandon the policy of unarmed resistance and risk losing international backing. `` I am against escalation on our side. I think we should try to keep the intefadeh bloodless,'' said <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activist who edits the biweekly Hebrew-language newsletter Gesher, or bridge, aimed at an Israeli audience. But he said Palestinian anger is rising over the lack of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> response to demands for an end to the occupation, the number of protesters killed and wounded and collective punishments such as curfews and work restrictions. `` These measures are responsible for any escalation that occurs on the Palestinian side,'' he said. <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, who heads a Palestinian study center in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is at a crossroads. The government must decide whether to accept <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for statehood or continue with a policy of confrontation. `` The situation is more dangerous now. People are so angry,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists out of the country for alleged espionage, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> responded with an identical set of expulsions, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` It's a mirror-image act of retaliation,'' Sir <PERSON> Rodric </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, told a news conference. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said its expulsions were legitimate and that the Soviet response was unjustified. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on either set of expulsions. On Friday, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON> was called to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and told that 11 Soviets were being expelled for `` activities incompatible with their status,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The spokesman would not detail the specific allegations, but `` incompatible activities'' is diplomatic parlance for espionage. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had not planned to make public the expulsions and did so only after the Soviets retaliated. On Saturday night, <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and told that 11 Britons were being expelled, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s political counselor, <PERSON> Roderic </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON>, said. In each case, eight diplomats and three journalists were expelled, <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said. Each group was given 14 days to leave the country. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, called <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s action `` a measured action in respect of established misbehavior'' and termed the Soviet response unjustified. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has `` incontrovertible evidence'' of wrongdoing by the expelled Soviets. He also urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to cease an alleged buildup of intelligence gathering in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, saying that was an area excluded from the general improvement in relations between the countries. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> radio reported the Soviets were caught spying on military installations. The Soviets were not identified. The Britons ordered out included Embassy Second Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; Second Secretary <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>; Third Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>; Vice Consul <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>; Naval Attache Capt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>; Assistant Naval Attache Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>; Assistant Military Attache Maj. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespear </PERSON>; and Warrant Officer Laing Purfit of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> staff. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover-James </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Roxburgh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> also were given two weeks to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roxburgh </PERSON> said he and the other <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> journalists were told by <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> had ordered them and the diplomats to leave `` because we had engaged in impermissible activities.'' `` Needless to say, I find the accusation ludicrous, almost too silly to comment on,'' <PERSON> Roxburgh </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director-general, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birt </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> would `` vigorously resist'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' expulsion. <PERSON> Glover-James </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he and the other Britons were accused of `` impermissible activity on the territory'' of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I'm not guilty of any spying, lawbreaking or any impermissible activity,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also declared on Friday that three former <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> workers, who already have completed their tours, were not welcome back, <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said. The Soviets responded by declaring three former <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> staff members `` persona non grata,'' he said. Asked why the British government kept its expulsions quiet, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, `` We look at these on a case-by-case basis and in this case we decided not to initiate publicity. But obviously once they -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- retaliated, it just broke.'' But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Conservative government had kept a `` bizarre and inexplicable silence,'' and added: `` The British public deserve a lot more information before they will accept that this is justified.''

 After 30 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, retired combat pilot Art <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is on a busman's holiday, building radio-controlled model airplanes and other flying machines. `` Other flying machines'' covers such things as a near-lifesize witch he frequently sends zooming at rooftop level on a broom-like contraption, and a flying doghouse with Snoopy from the `` Peanuts'' cartoon. A three-time national scale-model champion, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> now competes with a radio-controlled model of a B-26 bomber like those he flew in 65 combat missions over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in World War II. It took five years to build, has a nine-foot wingspan and is powered by two four-cycle engines. The radio controls operate the throttle, rudder and aileron, turn on landing lights, open bomb bay doors and release replica bombs. The witch flies with the help of a section of black umbrella that serves as an airfoil, sort of like a hang glider. Snoopy's doghouse uses the overhanging edges of the roof as wings. `` There's a personal accomplishment and satisfaction of flying something you've built,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 69. `` But it's not as easy as it looks. I could teach someone to fly a full-sized aircraft easier than a model,'' he said.

 Having two heads of state for commencement speakers might seem inspirational to many graduating seniors. But the presence of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 116th commencement Sunday dampened the spirits of some of the 5,400 graduates and their friends. `` It means no booze, no beach balls, no fun,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, 24, a recent <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> graduate who yelled to his graduating friends as they walked to their seats. `` We had to throw away the champagne bottles,'' said graduating senior <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, 21, who received a degree in political science. `` But I guess it is worth the trade-off if it means having the president here.'' But if some students were ambivalent about the extraordinary pomp and circumstance surrounding their graduation, many of the more than 30,000 alumni, friends and relatives in the packed audience were thrilled. Some, like <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, 72, a member of the class of 1939, came from as far away as <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, for the ceremony. `` It's great, really exciting,'' said <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, sitting with other members of the 50th reunion class. `` It's a lot different from 50 years ago. -LRB- Republican presidential candidate -RRB- <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> was our speaker then.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbar </PERSON>, 23, said his parents traveled from the small <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> for his graduation when they heard that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> were the featured speakers. `` It was a good reason for my parents to come,'' said <LOCATION> Anbar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, and their wives, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, were welcomed with applause and cheers. The heartiest and most surprising reception was reserved for Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who, since his failed presidential campaign, has been under siege locally for the state's fiscal crisis. Some of the students wore peace symbols on their gowns and the words `` Bush Knew'' on their mortar boards. A few held up protest signs when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his address. `` I'm wearing this because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew about the contras, but went ahead and made <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> the scapegoat,'' said <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, 22, a graduating senior from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It's an imperialist presidency and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should n't be there.'' Another group of demonstrators handed out leaflets outside the stadium, protesting the policies of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. But most of the students, a number of them holding tiny <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, said they were pleased with the commencement. They often interrupted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s speech, cheering his exhortations for environmental protection when he said: `` The <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is our planet, let us save it.'' `` We're pretty glad to have <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here,'' said graduating senior <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, 22. `` We're in this with our eyes open. We ca n't argue too much about the world we are going out into.'' `` We're all pretty bourgeois,'' said his friend, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, who is going on to law school. Another graduating senior, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON>, 22, from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said some in her class feared that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would overshadow them. `` But mostly it is exciting.

 A pastor told a biblical story of suffering and tragedy Sunday for parishioners, friends and neighbors grieving for a woman and five of her children, all killed in a fire. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eenigenburg </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> Sauk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> Bible Church, read from the book of Job, a story of the suffering of a righteous man struck unexpectedly by tragedy when his seven sons were killed. `` The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,'' the passage reads. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, 32, and his 7-year-old daughter <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>, were the only survivors of Friday's fire in this suburb south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. They were away from home when the fire broke out and killed <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, 27, and her children <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, 5; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 4; <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 3; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 1 -LCB-; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 5 months. The family had attended the church for about six months, <PERSON> Eenigenburg </PERSON> said. `` It was a touching service,'' the pastor said in a telephone interview afterwards. `` There were a lot of tears, and I had a hard time restraining myself ... when I imagined myself in his shoes.'' About 200 people, more than usual, packed the church. Many wrote out checks to help the family, <PERSON> Eenigenburg </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> has just been overwhelmed with gifts, clothes, that sort of thing,'' he said. `` I think people are really rising to the occasion.'' The funeral home handling services for the victims has `` underwritten all the immediate expenses with the hope they'll be reimbursed,'' <PERSON> Eenigenburg </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> had been laid off all winter from a steel mill and just started a job at a barrel factory in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` He had no benefits coming, certainly no insurance to handle the cost of the funerals,'' <PERSON> Eeignenburg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcuson </PERSON>, a childhood friend of <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, said he was organizing an all-night fund-raising event for the family June 24. `` She was fun, easy to get along with,'' <PERSON> Marcuson </PERSON> said. `` She always loved children.'' The Sauk Village Hall and the <ORGANIZATION> Calumet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan in <LOCATION> Sauk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> are accepting donations for the family. The cause of the blaze, which gutted the family home, was not determined, but fire investigators said it was accidental and started in the living room.

 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state politics were rocked last September when a young woman alleged that Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had invited her to his home, drugged her and sexually assaulted her. Eight months later, no criminal charges or lawsuits have been filed. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> goes on with his legislative work in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>.

Law enforcement authorities said charges were never filed against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> because there was a of lack of evidence. Threats of lawsuits were tossed back and forth between <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON> family, who had been old friends of the senator. `` I discussed -LRB- the case -RRB- with my attorney, and it is very difficult for a public official who has been a victim of false statements to take legal action,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said Thursday in a brief telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` I have put the matter behind me and am moving forward to do my job in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> would not comment on whether the case would affect his decision on whether to run for re-election in 1992. `` I have just put this whole thing behind me and that's all I have to say. ... I suggest others do the same,'' he said. <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>, now 26, married and a graduate student in English at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, did not return messages relayed through her mother and on her husband's answering machine at work. Her mother, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>, who once dated <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, said the case was on hold, and would not discuss it in detail. `` Certain things are being tracked down,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON> said. `` The thing is not dead.

 About 400,000 people waved banners, listened to speeches and marched through downtown on Sunday in support of the pro-democratic movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The crowd cut across all economic and age barriers as it tied up traffic for five hours in this British colony, which is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. Even staff from the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the unofficial representative of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, wrote a banner to support the pro-democracy marchers who have refused to end their massive protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. After marching for three hours, the protesters entered a race track and filled the stands and the field as they listened to speeches by community leaders, movie stars and lawmakers. The rally ended after two and a half hours but a steady flow of marchers continued to enter the course for two hours. Organizers estimated the number of protesters at 400,000.

<HEAD>It's Take Two For Former Congressman's Perjury Trial</HEAD>

 In October, he lost in his attempt to be tried and acquitted of 10 federal counts of perjury before Election Day. In November, he lost his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Monday brings former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s long-awaited day in court, barring a last-minute delay. The defense has sought to move the trial out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> because of publicity, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> has deferred any ruling on that request until he tries to seat an impartial jury in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The trial is crucial to the 38-year-old evangelical conservative's political future. The two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> has maintained a political organization, and says he would like to run against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., in 1992 _ if he is acquitted <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison. The indictment accuses <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> of lying under oath in early 1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with an associate, later convicted of money laundering, and with a federal undercover agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, running for re-election, waived his right to file pre-trial motions last October and asked that the case be tried immediately, with the congressman acting as his own attorney. Prosecutors agreed, and the trial began two weeks before Election Day. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> stopped the trial after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> campaign mailings, proclaiming his innocence, arrived at the homes of at least two jurors. Thirteen days later, on Nov. 8, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lost his 4th District seat, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs, to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, after a campaign marked by mud-slinging on both sides. In the indictment, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is accused of lying about his meetings with two men: <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, an associate and admitted money launderer, and `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>,'' actually <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, a federal agent posing as a money broker. Tapes of the encounters, leaked to the news media last year, show <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who was seeking an $ 850,000 loan to help pay for his luxurious Stone Mountain home, being told by `` Martinez'' that the money probably was connected with drugs and might pose problems for the congressman. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told the agent that if the money came to him through <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>'s company, `` it becomes <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' problem.'' The indictment contends that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied in concealing from the grand jury his discussions on how the tracks of the money would be covered to protect him. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> also told the grand jury that he `` never chose to borrow the money,'' although he acknowledged receiving a $ 150,000 check from LeChasney. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who conducted an animated defense in court last fall, has been represented in pre-trial motions this time by attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor. The former congressman has kept a low profile in the weeks preceding the trial. He did host a party for some 200 supporters at his home _ which is up for sale _ earlier this month. Standing on his diving board, he urged them to `` pray that justice will be served.''

 Workers were still working Sunday to stop a small leak of radioactive water at the <LOCATION> Pilgrim </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, a spokeswoman said. `` The leak was identified early in the week and the first repair plan was dropped,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` They had originally planned to use a gasket to seal the leak, but later decided it needed welding. We will not restart until the leak has been repaired.'' The leak was one of two incidents cited in a letter by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, calling for a suspension of the plant's license to operate. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the leak was minor and posed no threat to the public. `` It's really more of a drip, with only about 30 to 40 drips per minute,'' she said, likening the problem to a leaking bathroom faucet. The leak was detected last Monday in a water cleanup system located in the plant's reactor building, but does not directly affect the reactor. In a separate incident Thursday night, the reactor's protection systems were unintentionally activated when an operator threw a control switch prematurely. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> are among many officials who have cited problems at the plant since it was authorized to begin a gradual restart in December, more than two years after equipment and management troubles shut down the facility.

<TEXT>
 Economist Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1972, has died, his family announced Sunday. He was 85. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> died Saturday at his home at <LOCATION> Blockley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gloucestershire </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. No cause of death was announced. He was for many years a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION>. During his career, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> frequently criticized monetarism, which advocates the control of money as the chief method of stabilizing the economy. The theory, which now prevails in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, argues that strict government control of the money supply is necessary to prevent high inflation. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> once commented, `` What is wrong with monetarism is that it tries to put all the kinds of inflation into the same box.'' His early work paralleled that of J.M. <PERSON> Keynes </PERSON>, who believed the money supply is largely unimportant in determining demand. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> was was a pioneer in streamlining the general economic equilibrium theory, which explained the determination of prices and allocation of resources in an economy. It was for work on the equilibrium theory that <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1972, sharing it with <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrow </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The prize was established in 1968 by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sweden </ORGANIZATION> as a memorial to <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, who established the five Nobel Prizes. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> had been knighted in 1964 for his services to economics. Born in <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION> on April 8, 1904, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Clifton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> before winning a scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Balliol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, from which he graduated in 1925. <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> was a lecturer from 1926 to 1935.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday he was prepared to defend his press secretary's description of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a `` drugstore cowboy,'' a slang term suggesting a phony.

The press spokesman had used the term `` drugstore cowboy'' in saying that a rash of disarmament offers from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were just part of a public relations campaign. `` I think that one must be wary of caricatures,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is worth very much more than that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then said, `` So much for <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>. In fairness to the man ...'' At that point, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, standing next to the stage, said, `` No, do n't defend me.'' The president responded, `` No? Do n't defend you?

<HEAD>Man Who Saved Civilians At My Lai Breaks 20-Year Silence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> blinks away tears when he remembers the first child he rescued from the My Lai massacre. Pulled from a ditch, she was covered with the blood of the women, old men and children who filled it. `` I had a child about that size,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter pilot said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has broken a long silence about the events of March 16, 1968, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers killed more than 400 civilians in a Vietnamese hamlet. The 23-year-old warrant officer and his crews were the only soldiers at My Lai to rescue rather than kill. They saved the little girl, who was about 4 or 5 years old, and a group of 12 to 16 old men, women and children. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, now an oil field helicopter pilot and a part-time real estate agent, rarely talks about the massacre because of the memories. He testified at an Army inquiry in 1970, but would n't talk to reporters until TV producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilton </PERSON> made a second request for an interview, backing it up with a sample of his work. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the quality of that work persuaded him to talk to <PERSON> Bilton </PERSON>, whose documentary on My Lai airs Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> show `` Frontline.'' Others who testified at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> inquiry said soldiers wanted revenge for buddies killed at My Lai, a desolate cluster of rural villages said to be a Viet Cong stronghold. `` They were supposed to go through and kill off the enemy,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told The Daily Advertiser of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>. `` There's only one problem. There were n't any enemy.'' The inexperienced soldiers led by Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> left their base at 7:22 a.m. on March 16, 1968. `` They went in with blood in their eyes and shot everything that moved,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s mission was to look for enemy fire, and tell his gunship escorts where it was coming from. But as his helicopter darted over the trees, he could n't see any shooting. The routine reconnaissance turned into a nightmare. He and his men flew over a ditch full of bodies: old men, old women and babies. There were no young men; nobody who might have been a soldier. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> could n't figure out how all those people got into the ditch, or why they might have run out of their bunkers into the open. `` I remember coming upon one lady in the field. She was wounded, thrashing around on the ground in a lot of pain. We called on the radio for assistance to help her out,'' he said. `` An individual -LRB- <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier -RRB- walked up to her, nudged her, kicked her, stepped back and blew her away.'' In the ditch, someone moved. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and his two crew members went back. His crew chief, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Androtta </PERSON>, disentangled a little girl from the mass of bodies. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> radioed for help while he held the child, who was apparently unwounded but covered with blood. `` I could n't understand what was happening. I could n't understand why it was happening,'' he said quietly `` We're supposed to be the good guys. The helicopter took the child to a hospital, then returned. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> touched down between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers led by a lieutenant and an open-air bunker where an old man, two old women and about a dozen children cowered. `` I set down there and walked over ... and said, ` Hey, there's some old women, old men and kids in a bunker here Can you get'em out?' `` He -LRB- the lieutenant -RRB- said the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade. `` I said, ` Hold your men right here and we'll go over and see if we can do better than that,''' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> recalled. He said he did n't know if the lieutenant was <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>, who was the ranking officer at My Lai Asked about a story that he told one of his gunners to shoot the lieutenant if he tried to interfere, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said, `` Something like that was said. I do n't recall the exact words.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he motioned the children and old people around to his helicopter, then called in his gunships, which picked up the little group. `` They would have gotten killed,'' he said. In October 1969, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, crediting <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> with saving the lives of 16 children, awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was ordered court-martialed the next month on charges of premeditated murder of 109 Vietnamese. He was convicted in March 1971 of first-degree murder in the deaths of at least 22 villagers. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was the only one found guilty out of 25 officers and enlisted men who initially were charged and six who went on trial. He served three years of house arrest at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Knowing that he did all he could and did right at My Lai does n't make <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s memories any `` We're supposed to be the ones on the white horse in the big white hats,'' he said, shaking his head.

 The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, caught in transition between revolutionary force and modern army, has been thrust into a key role in the standoff between the government and pro-democracy students. As time passed and the government-ordered suppression of the monthlong student revolt failed to materialize, the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> appeared ill-prepared or reluctant to carry out its mission. Young soldiers waiting in convoys on the outskirts of the capital took cigarettes and drinks from protesters and listened intently as students lectured them on the campaign for democratic reform. Some flashed V-for-victory signs when their trucks retreated away from the city. It was harder to decipher how senior military officers were reacting to the most serious challenge to the social order the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has faced in its 40-year rule. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s one remaining official post is as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and it is believed to have been <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> who ordered the crackdown on the student movement. The 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is certain to have the support of other older officers who served in the old <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and continue to regard the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> as the last bastion of revolutionary integrity. Less certain is the backing of younger officers, the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>'s new ranks of professionals who may share some of the students' concerns about the slow pace of political reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> played a major role in restoring order during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fighting between different leftist factions brought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the brink of civil war. Since then, however, the nation's trust in the ideological purity of the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> has begun to slip. In the early 1980s, the army abandoned <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s concept of a guerrilla `` people's war,'' in which the army would beat back an attacker through sheer numbers and revolutionary fervor. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has reduced the number of troops by about 1 million since 1985, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fielded 4.2 million soldiers. He has brought back a ranking system abandoned for 23 years, emphasized better training and sought to create a modern military force. The <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>, however, has been saddled with severe budgetary restrictions as government funds were channeled to economic modernization programs. About two-thirds of defense industry factories have been switched to making civilian goods to help boost national production and exports. From 1950 to 1980, defense spending accounted for 17.2 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state expenditures, the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> says. In 1988, it received only 7.49 percent of the budget. Defense spending in actual terms is expected to fall about 6 percent this year after inflation. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> ranks were filled with young people attracted to the prestige of a military career and the possibility of escaping rural poverty. <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> members still command respect, but the low pay and harsh living conditions have made recruiting more difficult. In well-off rural areas, families commonly pay off local officials to keep their sons off local quota lists for enlistment. One recent report in the official media said the army is ending up with soldiers who are mentally retarded or illiterate or who have criminal records. Many recruits are eager to finish their term and return to civilian life so they can make money to buy the material comforts young people have come to expect. Such recruits are now listening with sympathy when students their own age chant `` the people's army belongs to the people.''

<TEXT>
 French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> expressed optimism Sunday that differences between the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies over European short-range nuclear missiles can be reconciled before next week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, appearing at a joint news conference with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was asked whether he was acting as an `` intermediary'' or `` conciliator'' in the missiles dispute. He replied: `` The only role I play is the role that is my natural role as a member of the alliance. But I'm not particularly there to act as a mediator. `` Obviously, I'm happy if views can be reconciled and I believe _ I think that they can be reconciled,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. `` I think that we have now the elements of ideas that could form a decision that will be taken just in a week's time.'' He added: `` I think that the decision that will be taken will be found positive from the point of view of all members of the alliance.'' The West German government has been advocating immediate negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on short-range nuclear missiles. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have balked, saying that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should first reduce its numerically superior conventional forces. Later in the news conference, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> noted that `` on this problem, like on other problems, at the outset people have diverging views, different opinions. But the important thing is to come to a meeting of the minds and to achieve a common answer. And this has always been the case in the alliance.'' The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader was asked whether the Cold War has now come to an end. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> replied that `` as far as the Cold War is concerned, one thing is clear _ and that is that we are moving out of the Cold War, and the chances are that this will be true for a very long time. There will be moments when things will be more difficult, doubtless, but I do n't imagine _ I do n't see us slipping right back into the Cold War.'' He added: `` Of course, anything is possible. A lot will depend on the trend of developments within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was asked whether he agreed with recent remarks by White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> in which the spokesman described Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a `` drugstore cowboy.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> replied: `` I think that one must be wary of caricatures _ Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is worth very much more than that.'' Earlier, the French president had shared commencement speaking duty with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> devoted his speech remarks largely to the environment and said, `` The earth is our planet, so let us save it.'' He departed for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in late afternoon.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Sunday offered a dozen guerrilla field commanders full autonomy in their regions if they stop fighting the government and help end the decade-old civil war. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> met with Iran-based Afghan guerrillas and said their view of the future of their country conformed with the Soviet view, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported Sunday. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> added that the guerrilla leaders had been invited to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the radio said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also appealed to the exiled king to do what he can to help restore peace to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` These people hold the destiny of future generations in their hands,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told the Loya Jirgah, the supreme governing body. `` A non-aligned and free <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> can not be obtained through military activities.'' The Loya Jirgah, or Grand Assembly, met over the weekend to extend a nationwide state of emergency for six months and empower the president to add another six months if he deems necessary. The state of emergency was declared Feb. 18, three days after the last Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and ended their nine-year military involvement in the country. The Loya Jirgah, meeting for only the 17th time since it was formed in 1702, is comprised of government officials, businessmen and tribal leaders. It meets to decide matters of pressing national importance. In the assembly's opening session Saturday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said a three-member commission would be appointed to negotiate with the guerrillas anywhere, at any time and on any terms. On Sunday, he went a step further and made his pitch to a dozen field commanders operating inside the country. His moves were seen as signs the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government is feeling the pressure of defending itself without Soviet troops. `` It is a great burden to be a field commander and I realize they have borne a great and arduous weight, unlike the luxury their leaders have enjoyed in exile'' said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses one name. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the government would help them if they stopped fighting and agreed to reconciliation. `` They can have power and sovereignty in their locality. They can have full military rank and full military authority and they can keep their weapons. They will be permitted their own autonomous administration,'' he said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his government met with field commanders inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and with guerrilla leaders in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the Moslem guerrillas are based, but he gave no details of the talks. Asked if the dozen field commanders named by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> had been contacted by the government, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said, `` it's a safe assumption.'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 15 field commanders either sat in on the Loya Jirgah sessions or sent representatives. Five of them were specifically invited by the president, he said. In a major policy reversal, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also appealed to <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, 74, the former king who has been living in exile in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> since he was overthrown by his cousin, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daud </PERSON>, in 1973. The ruling communist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> seized power from <PERSON> Daud </PERSON> in an April 1978 coup. `` He could be central to peace in this country,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said. The Afghan guerrillas are split into two alliances, the larger Pakistan-based Sunni Moslem cooalition, and the minority Shiite Moslem alliance based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Both groups engaged Soviet soldiers in heavy fighting after the 1979 invasion. But they have been at odds since the formation of an interim Afghan government in which the Shiite alliance is not represented. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> as saying that the guerrilla spokesman `` was against foreign intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and has expressed support for a broad-based government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' `` Our stance conforms completely with this view, and I have asked the leaders of the -LRB- Iran-based -RRB- alliance to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and they have said that they will think about the timing of such a trip,'' he said.

 Two boys who picketed a courthouse urging a judge to keep their younger siblings in a foster home away from their homeless mother said Sunday that the judge has decided the case to their liking. `` It was worth it,'' 13-year-old <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said of the after-school protests he and 12-year-old brother <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> staged twice last month outside the <LOCATION> Kandiyohi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>. `` At least for now we know they are not going back'' to their mother. The boys said their mother, <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Senescall </PERSON>, wanted to regain custody of her two youngest children to beef up her welfare checks. Based on their own childhood experiences, the two boys said their 9-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother would be subject to abuse under her care. Ms. <PERSON> Senescall </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls to the homeless shelter in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> where she lives were not returned. Her attorney, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Liedman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Willmar </LOCATION>, declined to comment. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said Sunday that Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> has decided for now to keep the younger children in a foster home in <LOCATION> Willmar </LOCATION>, not far from the foster home where he and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> live. <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said he could not comment because custody cases are confidential. `` I have made a decision and that's about all I can say,'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said Sunday. `` There is nothing currently before me.'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, the boys' foster mother, confirmed <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s account of the judge's decision. `` As far as I know, it's 100 percent true,'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said. `` For now, that's the way it's going to be, but how long nobody knows.'' <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said the boys decided to picket after they pleaded with the judge unsuccessfully to throw out their mother's request. `` We talked to the judge but he did n't listen,'' <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> said. `` We told him our brother and sister might get killed and he said, ` That's the chance we have to take.''' `` The picketing was <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s idea,'' he said. `` At first we felt weird but after a while we got used to it and it did us some good.'' The boys said their picketing in this west-central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town of about 13,600 prompted letters on their behalf and a lawyer to volunteer his services. It was the lawyer who informed them of the judge's decision because the boys were not allowed to attend court hearings, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said. The lawyer, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, told the boys there is still a chance their mother could regain custody of the younger children, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> has said custody cases are subject to review until children reach adulthood. He said in an interview that he was not swayed by the picketing. He said he relied strictly on evidence and testimony in court, where he heard conflicting stories. `` I admire their courage,'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said. `` They are obviously deeply concerned. I think it's -LRB- the picketing -RRB- a very legitimate forum for them to express their concerns.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said he was sexually and physically abused by men while he was under his mother's care. He says he complained about the abuse, but she did nothing. `` She acts like she cares, but she does n't,'' he said. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> says he also was physically abused by men while with his mother. The boys' parents divorced before the boys entered elementary school and Ms. <PERSON> Senescall </PERSON> agreed about seven years ago to put the children in foster homes, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Renville </LOCATION>, said he could n't care for his children because his job as a farm hand keeps him away from home for long stretches and he does n't earn much money. He said his ex-wife is unfit to care for the children, but he would n't give reasons. `` They sure wo n't have the best of care, I'll put it that way,'' he said. The boys' picketing prompted Orvel and <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratsch </PERSON> of rural <LOCATION> Renville </LOCATION> to write a letter to <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON>. The couple knew the <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> family before the parents divorced. `` Please believe <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>!!'' the <PERSON> Bratsches </PERSON> wrote. `` They know what they are talking about! Please do not send these children to live with their unfit mother.''

 Turkish and Soviet officials on Sunday discussed the asylum request of an air force pilot who fled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under fire in a MiG-29 fighter jet. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> requested political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Saturday after he fled his country and landed in the Turkish city of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION>. A deputy spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Belger </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>'s request for political refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is being evaluated under the framework of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s international obligations and practices.'' <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>, 28, was wounded in the right arm when he was fired on while taking off from a Soviet airport north of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Batumi </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON>. The pilot was operated on and was in good condition at the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> told reporters. In a statement carried Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the Turkish General Staff said Turkish radar spotted the MiG-29 and other Soviet planes in pursuit. It said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> did not sent any planes to intercept the MiG as it was about to land and that the Soviet planes chasing it turned back before entering Turkish airspace. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the MiG was flown back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Sunday after a group of Soviet technicians who arrived earlier in the day removed missiles and other weaponry from the plane. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> asked Turkish officials to extradite <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>, saying he stole the jet and shot and wounded a sentry guarding the aircraft at <LOCATION> Tskhakaya </LOCATION> airfield, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Belger </PERSON> said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> held talks with Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernishev </PERSON> on the matter earlier in the day.

<DATELINE>LA CHORRERA, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite an archbishop's exhortation that churches not be used for political purposes, three opposition leaders were applauded by the congregation when they attended Mass Sunday. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who ran for president in the May 7 election, and vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> church at midmorning to prolonged applause from about 1,000 worshipers. Outside the church more than 100 people waved green and white flags of the opposition. As <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> entered and left they shouted, `` Justice!'' and `` Endara presidente!'' Word had circulated since Saturday that the three would attend Mass in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorrera </LOCATION>, 18 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Independent observers of the May 7 election said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and other opposition candidates trounced the government slate lined up by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by a 3-1 margin. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the commander of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the government. On May 10 the government annulled the elections and also on that day paramilitary gangs attacked <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> with iron staves. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was the candidate for first vice president and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> for second vice president. Monsignor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, issued a letter on Saturday lamenting political rallies at several churches last Sunday. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic church claims the devotion of a great majority of the country's 2.5 million citizens. It had been generally quiet on political and social issues until the election annulment and the beating of the opposition candidates. It then spoke out against suppression of `` the popular will.'' But <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said in his letter the church had advised the opposition of its `` discontent'' with the rallies in churches `` in the hope that this kind of action will not be repeated.'' Sunday's Mass was delayed as dozens of journalists gathered around the front of the altar. The Rev. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>, the parish priest, appealed for `` respect for the sanctity of this house of God'' and the area was cleared. `` These gentlemen -LRB- the opposition leaders -RRB- are Christians and can come to Mass here. But we are here to honor God, and this can not be converted into a political act,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> before saying Mass. The government on Saturday prohibited `` marches, meetings, public demonstrations or caravans of vehicles'' by any political organization until at least June 5. A government statement said the action was taken because of the scheduled visit this week by delegates from the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The opposition leaders said the ban was unconstitutional and on Saturday they were in a motorcade that drove through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> drawing cheering crowds. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, are due in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Tuesday to try to help resolve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s governmental crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> last week approved a resolution that held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> responsible for `` abuses'' and called for `` a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.'' Opposition leaders say they will tell the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation that results of the May 7 election be recognized and implemented. `` The annulment must be annulled,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Daughter Asks Court To Declare De Kooning Mentally Incompetent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The daughter of artist <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON>, who is said to have Alzheimer's disease, asked a court to declare him mentally incompetent to manage property worth up to $ 150 million, according to ARTnews magazine. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON>, 85, lives in East Hampton on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and continues to paint daily with the violent, slashing strokes that have earned him fame as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most prominent living artists. His daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, and his attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, have filed a petition in state court in <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION> requesting they be named co-conservators of the artist's assets, which have an estimated worth of $ 100 million to $ 150 million, according to ARTnews' summer issue. Eastman, reached by telephone Sunday at his East Hampton home, confirmed that the petition was filed in mid-February, but refused to comment further. The battle over representing de Kooning began two years ago when his longtime dealer, <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON>, died, ARTnews said. Formal exhibitions and sales of the painter's works were on hold while offers were considered by his daughter, whose mother is artist <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, the magazine said. Two weeks after de Kooning's wife died of cancer, his daughter and <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> filed the petition. The petition said that although the artist `` continues to paint daily and masterfully ... his physical and mental condition prevents him from performing everyday tasks and managing his finances,'' according to ARTnews. Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortati </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> physician, submitted an affidavit to the court which said `` it would appear ... Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON> suffers from Alzheimer's disease,'' the magazine said. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible disorder whose symptoms include gradual memory loss, impairment of judgment, disorientation, personality change, difficulty in learning and loss of language skills. The petition said Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON> is the sole beneficiary of her father's will and last year received about $ 25,000 a month from him, according to ARTnews. Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON>, an animal rights activist and amateur sculptor who is married and has a child, has lived in a house her father built for her on his property since 1983. No date has been set for a hearing on the petition, according to ARTnews. Court officials were not available for comment Sunday. If granted, the petition would give Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON> and Eastman control over the artist's representation and his assets, which include $ 7 million in real estate, cash and securities and more than 300 paintings. The average worth of each painting is estimated to be between $ 300,000 and $ 650,000. However, his `` Pink Lady'' sold at a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction for $ 3.6 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> appealed Monday to the leaders of French-speaking nations, gathering this week for a summit in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, to halt widespread human rights abuses in their countries. In a 38-page report issued for the third Francophone Summit, which opens Wednesday, the human rights organization listed what it called `` very numerous cases of human rights violations in more than 30 francophone countries.'' Included are frequent cases of torture, secret imprisonment, lengthy detention without trial and bad prison conditions. Among the cases cited is that of <PERSON> Salet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaba </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, who has not been heard from since his arrest in June 1987. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said it heard <PERSON> Gaba </PERSON> had died after being mistreated in prison, and it called for a government inquiry. There has been no response from President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON>'s government. About 40 countries in which French is spoken _ ranging from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ are expected to attend the <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> meeting. The countries criticized by Amnesty include two that refuse to attend meetings of the group: <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. While most of the accusations of human rights abuses were directed at former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> colonies in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, even <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> did not escape criticism. The Swiss were criticized for refusing to allow conscientious objectors to perform civilian service as an alternative to their draft duty, and the French for requiring objectors to serve two years of alternative service, compared with just one year for army draftees.

A college spokesman, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, told the News that <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> was awarded a one-year fellowship leave at $ 30,000 _ half his usual pay _ last August. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said he has asked the college to extend his leave for another year. He told the college, part of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, that he would use the fellowship to `` increase knowledge in the culture and politics of West Indians with particular emphasis on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said he became <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s alternate <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> representative `` four or five months ago'' and receives $ 3,000 monthly in salary and expenses from that country. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said the college was enquiring to see if <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s status had changed since he became a Noriega representative. In a telephone interview Sunday, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` a fixation on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' `` If they have a fixation on him they do not have to discuss or question the real reason why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ to attempt to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> after the year 2000,'' he said.

The officers had been directing <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> to a parking area near the campus where 30,000 graduates and their families gathered to hear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> deliver the keynote address. Investigating officers reported there was no apparent negligence on the part of Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and no charges were filed, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a resident of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, stopped to talk to the officers after she encountered a roadblock. She then put the car in reverse and the car suddenly lurched backwards, knocking the officers down. `` One officer was hit in the knee with the car's fender, another was hit by the door as it flung open and a third was swept back about 10 feet by the door itself,'' <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> said. She said Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> sedan then bashed into an police truck stationed at the roadblock. `` That's what stopped the vehicle,'' <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> said. Two of the officers had minor cuts and bruises and the one who was swept back 10 feet suffered minor head and neck injuries, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> said. All three were treated at a hospital and released. `` All's well that ends well, so to speak,'' <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> said. There was no immediate from Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>; she did not return a message left on the answering machine at her home in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was officially welcomed back to the Arab fold, after an absence of 10 years, as the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> opened a ministerial meeting Sunday to prepare for a summit conference. Moroccan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdel-Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Filali </PERSON>, in the opening address, said, `` We are all witnessing today an important historical event demonstrated in the participation of the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s delegation ... in our meetings after a long absence.'' Two seats for delegates from the 22-nation Arab League were vacant at the conference hall. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is boycotting the session because it opposes <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to the league, and there was no representative from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where there are rival Christian and Moslem governments <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s membership was suspended after former President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> signed a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979. `` I am certain that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the resumption of its full membership in our organization will contribute to joint <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> action and the strengthening of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> solidarity,'' <PERSON> Filali </PERSON> said. Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> said in response: `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is pleased to resume its membership and the historical and important responsibilities that entails. `` It also stresses it shall fulfill its duties in accordance with the Arab League charter.'' <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is expected to attend the summit conference that opens Tuesday. The ministerial meeting began at 7 p.m. after several delays because of a six-member committee discussion of the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Christian militias have been waging artillery duels with Syrian army units and their Druse allies. The committee did not submit a report but agreed to recommend to the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders that both of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s declared prime ministers, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moslem </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, be invited to the summit. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, `` voiced reservations'' about the proposal to invite Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> who has vowed to dislodge Syrian forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, according to conference sources who spoke with the condition they not be identified. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> will be two of the main topics at the summit. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is expected to complain that it has not received the aid promised at the last Arab summit in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in June 1988. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials say league members promised to give the organization a $ 128 million one-time payment and then $ 43 million per month. They said only <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> contributed to the one-time payment, with the Saudis providing $ 28 million and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> $ 12 million. They also said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has received only $ 12 million in promised monthly allocations.

 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> crews responding to the collapse of an MX missile in an underground silo last summer were concerned that the rocket could have accidentally ignited, according to a report published Sunday. Ignition inside silo Q-10 at F.E. <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> could have strewn highly radioactive plutonium around the site near <LOCATION> Guernsey </LOCATION>, the Casper Star-Tribune said in a report based on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s final accident report, which the newspaper obtained through a Freedom of Information request. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banta </PERSON> was quoted in the accident report as saying work crews worried that the rocket's solid fuel might have been cracked by the collapse. `` If you have cracked propellant and you start moving it, you can get friction within the crack and there was concern that it could cause ignition,'' he said. `` It -LRB- the missile's condition -RRB- was an unknown. We were operating under the -LRB- rocket maker <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> premise that said it was relatively stable; if you do n't move too fast and do n't put a lot of energy into the system, nothing will happen,'' said <PERSON> Banta </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials declined comment when contacted by the newspaper, saying the report spoke for itself. The missile, capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads, slid roughly 6 inches down in its silo sometime between last June 12 and June 15 when part of the rocket's aft skirt collapsed. During the incident the missile gave a `` missile away'' signal, but <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials in their initial report attributed that to the rocket's umbilical cord breaking away when the weapon settled to the base of its silo. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in January that the accident led the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to take the heavy warheads off that missile and four others from the same production batch that had a common problem. The newspaper said the action ws taken to relieve weight on the missile until the problem could be solved. Investigation determined that the collapsed missile's fuel did not crack. In addition, the severing of the umbilical cord meant there was no direct electrical connection and a grounding system to protect the missile from static electricity was intact, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> placed odds of an accidental ignition at less than one chance in 10 million. An outside military authority, retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, told the Star-Tribune the ignition danger was much higher, but admitted he had no involvement with the MX missile. He is associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the greatest danger of an accidental ignition of the solid rocket fuel is the heat it would create inside the sealed silo. `` This fire would cook off or explode the HE -LRB- high explosive -RRB- component of the warhead,'' he said. `` You then have a high explosive yield which would possibly blow open the missile hatch and distribute radioactive material for some unknown distance. That would be very bad.''

 Three West Germans working for the ASME-Humanitas relief organization left <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Sunday, six days after two colleagues were reported kidnapped in this southern port city. A police spokesman said the three boarded the Lebanese cargo ship <LOCATION> Libra </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and it departed for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> at 5 p.m. <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Quint </PERSON>, 21, who was reported abducted May 4 and returned safely to the group on May 14, was one of the three. The others were not identified. <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> was reported kidnapped with <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, a nurse, and <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, an administrator. Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> were released in a few hours but <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> was held until May 14. On May 16, Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemptner </PERSON>, 28, were seized by gunmen in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> was freed a few hours later by local militiamen looking for thieves who stopped the abductors' car. <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemptner </PERSON> are still missing. There have been no claims of responsibility for the reported kidnappings, and <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> have refused to identify their abductors or provide other details. Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, 26, told reporters she would stay in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemptner </PERSON> were freed. Another woman working for <ORGANIZATION> ASME-Humanitas </ORGANIZATION> also remained in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Germans have been staying since Thursday in two bases their organization maintains in <PERSON> Zahrani </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Aaqbiyeh </LOCATION>, six miles south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia. The Germans were expelled on Thursday from their main base at the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which accused them of concealing the identities of those involved in the kidnappings and of ignoring security regulations. At least 15 other foreigners are being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 The army said Sunday it detained hundreds of Moslem militants in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the largest such sweep since the Arab uprising began. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> threatened to resign if his party does not back his peace plan. In continued violence in the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians and wounded at least 25 in clashes. The Cabinet debated proposals to seal off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, a day after PLO-led activists of the 17-month uprising vowed in a leaflet to kill an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier or settler to avenge every Palestinian killed by Israeli troops. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla chief, called for the use of firearms in an interview with the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watan </ORGANIZATION> published Sunday. `` I see that the time has now come to use arms in support of the intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising, he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, has been branded a terrorist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of his involvement in the 1985 hijacking of the Italian passenger ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> in which an American, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>, was killed. `` If a Palestinian is killed, we shall kill a soldier,'' said slogans painted in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which describes itself as a paramilitary branch of the uprising's underground leadership. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said such calls were nothing new. `` I do n't know the difference between intefadeh and terror,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We know that terror organizations are very active in all stages of the intefadeh.'' The army on Sunday lifted a six-day curfew confining 700,000 people to their homes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, but few Gazans returned to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because of a strike ordered by the uprising leadership. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, head of the army's central command, said the curfew was used to detain 250 suspected activists of <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, a Moslem fundamentalist movement. One of those arrested was the movement's spiritual leader, Sheikh <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>. Those arrested are suspected of carrying out attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and Arabs alleged to have collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including shootings, bombings and firebomb attacks. They also are accused of organizing and enforcing anti-Israeli protests, the army said. Army officials described the sweep as the largest since the December 1987 start of the Palestinian revolt. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for `` zeal,'' is considered the strongest movement in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. It advocates an Islamic state in the occupied lands and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, putting it at odds with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which publicly demands only a secular Palestinian state in the occupied lands. Sunday's casualties brought to at least 496 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising, which began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have died. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Nuseirat refugee camp, troops killed <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqel </PERSON>, 17, Arab hospital officials said. At least 17 Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing confrontations with soldiers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, eight Arabs were wounded in clashes in four villages. In Abu Dis near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, soldiers dispersing a protest by hundreds of young Palestinians killed <PERSON> Haitham </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Arakat </PERSON>, 18, said officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Muqassed hospital. The army confirmed only one wounded and the death in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> threatened to step down if his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc votes against his peace plan, which calls for Palestinians in the occupied lands to elect <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a period of self-rule. Talks would follow later on the final status of the territories. `` I will not be able to continue in my position if I do not feel that the movement I represent in the government supports me and stands by my side,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s central committee is due to vote on the subject in June, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s two key rivals, Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and Housing Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, have threatened to join ranks and defeat the plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> left Sunday for a two-day visit to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in very critical condition Sunday, and his doctors said the former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> president was alert and responding to medication. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, is undergoing kidney dialysis, has a respirator to help him breath and is hooked up to a monitoring system, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, assistant adminstrator of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is alert and conscious and seems to be responding to medication to fight a bacterial infection, said <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, who stressed this did n't mean there has been any improvement in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' condition `` His condition is episodic _ up and down. He's still in the upswing mode,'' <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said at what was to be the only scheduled medical briefing Sunday. On Saturday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was more alert and was able to communicate with doctors through hand signals, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, meanwhile, denounced statements attributed to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters during a rally in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Saturday that Americans would be killed if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> dies in exile. The statement might have been the work of radicals infiltrating <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters and attempting to provoke a violent reaction to <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s announcement that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> will not be allowed to return, even if he dies, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` It was precisely to bring about a reconciliation and to avoid a continuation of this division that, transcending my own pain and hurt, I appealed to Madame Aquino to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to die in his homeland,'' she said. `` I do n't want violence, and I'm afraid that the hard-line statements of the madame -LRB- Aquino -RRB- have caused this emotional reaction among some people,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday denied the Marcoses' petition to force the government to allow their return `` We are being kicked back and forth like a football, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is being made into the fall guy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. During a convention in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> of a revived opposition party, Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who played a key role in the revolt against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, said Sunday that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should display leadership by allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to die in his homeland. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who was named secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said `` there is no reason why he should be deprived of his right to come home at this time of his life.

 A huge thunderstorm forced the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to postpone the launch of an advanced navigation satellite for a second time Sunday night. The launch was rescheduled for Tuesday at 7:43 p.m. Officials decided to stand down 48 hours because Monday's weather forecast was not favorable and the launch team needed a rest period, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> launch commentator. `` The weather is bad and getting worse,'' Rand said. `` There is a thunderstorm, an anvil cloud and lightning within five miles of the launch pad.

The postponement was announced 40 minutes before the planned liftoff of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 rocket at 7:51 p.m. The launch was first postponed Saturday night because of strong winds above the launch pad. The countdown clock then stood at 4 minutes.

<TEXT>
 More than 150 people have been killed in fighting over land ownership and grazing areas in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s western Darfar region, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> newspapers reported Sunday. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the fighting began Friday when about 3,000 Arabs attacked members of the African Fur tribe in the vicinity of <PERSON> Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON>. Interior Minister <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> went to the region Sunday to try to stop the fighting. The <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the newspaper accounts, saying a report would be issued when it received information from <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>. There was no indication the Darfar fighting is linked to the civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> that has claimed thousands of lives since 1983. Most of the rebels in the south are Christians or animists who want greater automony from the predominantly Arab-Moslem government in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. A train carrying 1,500 tons of food and other relief supplies was en route Sunday to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> as part of a project to avoid a repeat of last year's disaster, when up to 500,000 people died of starvation and disease in villages isolated by the war.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, facing disarmament pressure from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, expressed concern Sunday about `` a growing complacency throughout the West'' and said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and her allies must not drop their guard against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

He said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have been in close touch with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on the missile issue, adding that he agrees with her that `` we can get together on this vexing question ...'' `` My role has been behind the scenes, to be helpful in working this problem ... to iron out those differences,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> periodically faces internal controversies such as the current one, adding he was hopeful this latest difficulty would be resolved before the summit opens. `` I'd be happy if the views can be reconciled,'' the French leader said. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> fielded one news conference question by dismissing a comment from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> that Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was a `` drugstore cowboy'' whose arms control proposals lack substance. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is worth very much more than that,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said, dismissing `` caricatures.'' As the words were translated, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed and said, `` So much for <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>.'' He added, `` I could defend Marlin'' _ but he neither did that nor disavowed the spokesman's earlier remark. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> devoted his commencement address remarks largely to the environment and said, `` The earth is our planet, so let us save it.'' The two leaders flew here together after a day of talks Saturday at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation estate overlooking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on a rocky point in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. They spoke before a commencement audience estimated at 31,000 people attending the ceremony at <LOCATION> Nickerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> football stadium. In the hometown of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his defeated rival for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got a standing ovation. But the cheers for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also on the stage, were louder. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech was designed to set the stage for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit opening in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on May 29. The 16-nation meeting has been threatened by discord over short-range nuclear missiles in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Over opposition from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been leading a call for <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations to reduce the weapons, and has been resisting plans to upgrade the missiles. The dispute has been aggravated by a series of disarmament offers from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that have put pressure on the West to take similar steps. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week, saying he was responding too timidly to arms proposals from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Praising French and British programs to upgrade their nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We do have a major concern. There's a growing complacency throughout the West.'' Underscoring his remark, he said there was `` a great irony'' in that `` while an ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the very communist foundation, the West is being tested by complacency.'' `` We must never forget that twice in this century, American blood has been shed over conflicts that began in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Calling the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> central to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We must never forget that to keep the peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is to keep the peace for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Without referring directly to the missile dispute, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said nuclear weapons are an essential ingredient for the defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Our short-range deterrent forces based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and kept up to date, demonstrate that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s vital interests are bound inextricably to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that an attacker can never gamble on a test of strength with just our conventional forces,'' the president said. `` Though hope is now running high for a more peaceful continent, the history of this century teaches Americans and Europeans to remain prepared,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said he was grateful for steps taken by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying `` If the Soviets advance solid and constructive plans for peace, then we should give credit where credit is due. `` We are seeing sweeping changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that show promise of enduring, of becoming ingrained,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, in an era of extraordinary change, we have an obligation to temper optimism _ and I am optimistic _ with prudence.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I believe in a step-by-step approach to East-West relations because recurring signs show that while change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is dramatic, it is not yet complete.'' He said the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> retains nearly a 12-to-1 advantage over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> in short-range missile and rocket launchers and more than a 2-to-1 edge in battle tanks. On an economic front, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke warmly yet cautiously about <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s plans for a single common market free of internal trade barriers by 1992. He said that despite apprehensions in some quarters about what a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will bring, `` this administration is of one mind. We believe a strong, united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> means a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` ... it is important to distinguish adversaries from allies and allies from adversaries,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` What a tragedy _ what an absurdity _ it would be if future historians attribute the demise of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> to disputes over beef hormones and wars over pasta.'' That was a reference to two trade areas that have separated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state troopers who had stopped a suspected drunken driver were killed early Sunday when a tractor-trailer rig struck their patrol car, crushing the officers between the two cars. The troopers, identified as Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhnle </PERSON>, 36, and Trooper <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerda </PERSON>, 29 died just before 3 a.m. on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 90, said <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. `` They had made a DWI traffic arrest and had requested routine registration information, then had requested a wrecker,'' said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. `` But when one of the dispatchers called them back with the registration information, they did not answer their radio.'' The tractor-trailer rig, traveling westbound on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 90, veered off the road and struck the patrol car from behind. <PERSON> Kuhnle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zerda </PERSON>, both standing between their vehicle and the suspect's car, were hit and died instantly, said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. The force of the impact threw <PERSON> Kuhnle </PERSON>'s body about 500 feet. The officers' car, which had been legally parked on the highway's improved shoulder, was destroyed, he said But the suspect, who had been placed in the car in a drunken driving investigation, sustained only minor injuries. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he was treated and released from <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for cuts and bruises. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said no charges were filed against the suspect because `` the only two witnesses who could place him behind the wheel were dead.'' The truck driver, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Tucumcari </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, was uninjured in the accident. He remains in <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. A blood sample taken from <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> was scheduled to be analyzed for alcohol content. <PERSON> Kuhnle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zerda </PERSON>, both stationed in <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, became the 64th and 65th troopers killed in the line of duty since the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> highway patrol began in 1930, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> may try to use <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 17 billion pension fund to back the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to protect jobs provided by the Miami-based airline, according to reports Sunday. Two newspapers, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, reported that an investment of at least $ 50 million was being considered, given the proper guarantees against loss. Two high-ranking state aides were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Friday for talks with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' pilot union and financial and legal consultants. One of them, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' chief of operations, confirmed the negotiations. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> `` is extremely interested in protecting Floridians' jobs'' and wants to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in one piece and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, `` but we'll do nothing that would n't be an outstanding investment for -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s -RRB- pension holders. The loan was proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose support of striking Machinists has kept the Miami-based airline virtually grounded since March 4. `` We propose to to give them a very secure investment for the pension plan, and get Eastern back,'' said <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, executive administrator of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>. At the time the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employed about 30,000 workers, 12,000 of them in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The unions were seeking the financial help as part of negotiations between the airline unions and two potential buyers: <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> An Eastern spokesman scoffed at the investment idea Saturday. `` The <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> proposals can best be described as humpty-dumpty,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` Neither one is economically realistic. If the state chooses to invest its money that way, it will probably be the fastest method on record to find out whether pensioners can survive on Social Security checks alone.'' Details of the offers from <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> have been unavailable, but both reportedly call for $ 210 million in wage concessions in each of the next five years in exchange for partial ownership. A representative of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s investor group said its bid included $ 725 million in new capital, although only a small part would be cash. To complete the deal and satisfy a federal bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who must approve the sale, the unions would need to raise at least $ 50 million more, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. Searching for the balance, union officials approached the state and other pension funds, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. To guarantee the state money, the unions would agree to place 1 percent of the airline's labor payroll in an escrow account as insurance that the state would receive a return on the investment. `` Labor can guarantee that money if for any reason the company was unable to pay dividends for the state's investment,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinkle </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, refused to discuss specifics, but noted that `` we look at investment possibilities every day.'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s pension fund is one of the healthiest in the nation, containing about $ 17 billion in a diverse portfolio of common stocks, bonds and real estate. It is the 12th largest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 25th largest in the world, <PERSON> Hinkle </PERSON> said. As governor, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> sits at the head of the state's three-member <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees state investments Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9. Any sale must be approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who on Monday will receive a report on the offers by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and consider developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer to buy the airlines' shuttle service between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed selling $ 1.8 billion in assets to restructure the airline into a smaller operation. In addition to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 365 million offer for the shuttle, Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has made a $ 751-million bid for the shuttle and 15 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 525 million for 15 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s, maintenance hangers and airport landing slots in 10 cities.

<HEAD>Year's Third Endangered Condor Chick Coaxed From Egg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick was coaxed from its egg Sunday as keepers clucked over the year's third successful hatching in an ongoing effort to save the giant vulture from extinction. The chick, named <PERSON> Kaduku </PERSON>, was the first conceived by a pair of 6-year-old birds at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, changing biologists' notions about when condors reach sexual maturity, said <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON> `` It previously was not known if <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors achieved full sexual maturity at age 6 or 7,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It was thought to be 7 but these birds proved us wrong.'' The sparsely feathered bird, hatched from a pale aqua-colored egg laid on Easter Sunday, weighed 5.8 ounces after it was helped from the shell by handlers at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> park around 11:20 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It was our Easter egg,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. `` It looks really healthy and is doing great.'' The baby, whose Konkow Indian name means `` very strong being, both physically and spiritually,'' joined two other chicks at the park's so-called `` condorminium'' and was scheduled to take its first meal of minced mouse meat Sunday night. The baby bird, conceived by a pair of birds named <PERSON> Cayuma </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cachuma </PERSON>, was the fourth captive-bred condor chick successfully hatched, bringing the world's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor population to 31. All remaining wild condors, which are <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land birds, have been captured in hopes of building their numbers in captivity. Seventeen condors are housed at the animal park in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 30 miles northeast of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and the other 14 live at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. Sunday's hatching followed one on Thursday and the year's first on April 19. The first captive-bred chick, named <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, hatched in 1988 and remains in good health as do the other chicks. Like all previous captive condor chicks, <PERSON> Kaduku </PERSON> was brought to the `` condormimium'' in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> as soon as the egg was laid in hopes the parents would produce another egg to replace it. The female <PERSON> Cachuma </PERSON> previously produced another egg, but it was infertile. Los Angeles Zoo officials have been encouraged by the pair's continued affectionate behavior, saying they hoped the birds would become productive members of the breeding program The chicks are raised by handlers who use lifelike condor-replica puppets to feed the birds, allowing for close scrutiny of their daily progress by while maintaining the chicks' identification with their own kind The captive-breeding program was established when numbers of the black carrion-eaters dwindled because of shooting and pesticide contamination.

 Thousands of native Chinese marched together in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and scores of other cities Sunday in a worldwide show of solidarity with their besieged brethren in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likened the protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the civil rights marches led by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> government </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> condemned the actions of the rival communist regime on the mainland. The demonstrations came as hundreds of thousands of people in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> defied martial law for a second day in a row and swarmed through the city demanding democratic reforms. The army was reportedly poised for a crackdown. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1997, an estimated 400,000 people virtually paralyzed the city during a peaceful march in support of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protesters. Media were generally supportive. Even the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the unofficial representative of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, wrote a banner to support the marchers. The crowd marched for three hours, then entered a race track and listened to speeches by community leaders, movie stars and lawmakers. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Chinese students said in an open telegram that they no longer recognize the government led by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. `` We 10,000 Chinese students in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are on the side of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' the telegram said. `` We no longer recognize the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government led by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> as a legal administration in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and we pledge our complete disobedience to such a hostile government towards the whole Chinese nation.'' About 300 students attended a demonstration at the Chinese consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Three students met with officials of the Chinese consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and delivered the telegram. Other rallies were held in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Nationalist government condemned the communist <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government for ordering military troops to crack down on the student-led protests. It said it may take `` effective measures'' to support the pro-democracy movement. Government spokesman <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-ming </PERSON> refused to say what that might include, because `` we do n't want to offer the mainland any excuse to take retaliatory action against the students.'' The Nationalists, who fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 when they lost a civil war in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, continue to claim they are the legitimate government of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Nationalists and Communist Chinese are technically still at war. About 100 Taiwanese demonstrated in the capital, <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, to support the Chinese protesters. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, thousands of Chinese studying in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rallied and marched downtown. Spokesman <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said 4,500 people joined in the gathering organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Police estimated the number at 2,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students also marched in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tsukuba </LOCATION> and other cities. About 1,000 Chinese students demonstrated Sunday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, carrying banners in French and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> with slogans such as `` Brothers and sisters we love you, old dictators we hate you,'' and `` 1789 Liberty for the French, 1989 Democracy for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION>; Bastille Equals Tiananmen.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is celebrating the bicentennial of its revolution this year, with festivities climaxing on July 14, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on Chinese authorities Sunday to show restraint in dealing with the pro-democracy demonstrations, urging officials to be `` as forthcoming as possible in order to see more democratization, and to see a peaceful resolution.'' `` I do not want to see bloodshed,'' he told reporters. `` We revere the model of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> in this country for his peaceful protest,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The remarks were his first detailed comments on the situation.

 When actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> took over as honorary mayor of this celebrity enclave, he shook up some of his neighbors by declaring the beach community a nuclear-free haven for the homeless and aliens.

 Choreographer <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON>, artistic associate of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, has some new ballets for the company this season. Instead of slipping them into the repertoire one a week, as might be expected, the company premiered three with a flourish on the same night, Saturday, at the Metropolitan Opera House. The first, `` Everlast,'' is set in 1919 and tells a story, like a charming movie of the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION> era, of a girl, danced by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, whose mother decides to marry her off to a boxing champ, danced by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Day </PERSON>, for his money. The girl prefers dancing with the boys in the chorus. A waitress, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>, falls for the champ and dresses like a boy to get hired to work with his trainer. A couple of old busybodies, danced by <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, provide comic relief in an already light-hearted dance. They scoot in with potted trees in front of them, to spy on the oh-you-kid goings on and report to the mother, danced by <PERSON> Georgina </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. The music is 16 songs by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, chosen for lyrics that tell the story. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Graae </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> sang them, on stage with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dansicker </PERSON> at an upright piano. `` Everlast,'' at 40 minutes, is shorter than <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> movie musicals because the plot is told by, instead of interrupted by, the songs and dancing. There is real dancing in `` Everlast,'' as a solo to `` Left All Alone Again Blues.'' We very much admire `` Quartet,'' the second <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere, which uses four dancers and a recording by the Kronos Quartet of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> music. It's in the tradition of modern-looking, plotless ballets to modern music like `` Episodes,'' which <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> choreographed to <LOCATION> Webern </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alessandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamente </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> looked good, often dancing in unison, sometimes one couple's dancing echoing what the other had just done. Wearing crisp white shirts and black shorts, they moved constantly but never seemed frenetic. Miss <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> is known for novelty and `` Bum's Rush,'' which we liked least of the three, is a novelty ballet, set on a vaudeville stage. Stagehands dance, so does a baggy-pants comedian. A truck tire with shapely legs and toe shoes sticking down from it walks around, gets between a ballerina and her partner or amusingly collapses on itself. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> composed music for the half-hour romp. Our favorite part of it was jazz dancing by two men and our least favorite part slapstick by three men making animal noises. The three dances were premiered earlier this year in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, respectively. The evening ended with an older <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> dance, `` In the Upper Room.''

 Students occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in violation of martial law for a third day Monday as a reported ultimatum by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> passed. Hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets to defend the students from a feared military crackdown. City residents surrounded troop convoys with thousands of people and blocked major roads with public buses, trucks and garbage cans. Protesters drove buses up to subway entrances on the square to block any emerging troops. Supporters also formed a human cordon around the protesters at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, while motorcyclists and bicyclists signaled their support by circling the square in a noisy procession. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> citizens, angered by <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s hard-line stance, vowed defiantly to continue their support until the premier resigns. Many also demanded the resignation of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, believing <PERSON> Li </PERSON> acted on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s orders. `` Li and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> are stopping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from advancing,'' said a worker from a machine factory. `` They should step down and let <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> become a powerful country.'' As the political situation became increasingly murky, rumors swirled around the city. One unconfirmed report broadcast by students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> claimed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> had resigned. At the vast square, students sang the `` Internationale'' and the Chinese national anthem as the reported 5 a.m. Monday -LRB- 4 p.m. EDT Sunday -RRB- deadline for leaving the square went by without incident. `` We will not retreat from the square,'' student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said over a loudspeaker. He led the 200,000 students and supporters in a pledge: `` We wo n't give up until we reach our goals.'' There were no reports of movement by soldiers who on Saturday occupied major state-run news organizations and sealed off some roads leading into the capital. Chinese sources said 1,500 soldiers armed with automatic weapons had moved into the train station about a mile east of the square, but the troops did not appear during the night. The independent student union that has led the protests announced it received a message from <PERSON> Li </PERSON> saying the military would clear <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> by force by 5 a.m. The student loudspeaker announced that the union had rejected <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s ultimatum and called on the protesters to remain calm and restrained. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Radio and national television denied an ultimatum had been given and read a statement that the troops' goal was to restore order, not suppress the students. But it was clear order could not be restored without ending the occupation of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, the focus of five weeks of pro-democracy protests. The students are demanding a nationally televised dialogue with the government, recognition of their independent student unions and government measures to ensure freedom of the press and an end to official corruption. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> called in the 27th and 28th armies Friday night and declared martial law in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday. However, his inability to enforce martial law made it clear an intense political struggle was going on behind the scenes. The status of relatively liberal Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, said by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources to have resigned in protest, remained unclear. There was no official statement. The exact number of soldiers called in was not immediately known. A Chinese source said 60,000 to 70,000 soldiers moved into the city center by subway and followed connecting tunnels to the walled palace, the history museum and the Great Hall of the People on three sides of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. The subway was closed to regular traffic most Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> and the Central Television Station also were occupied by troops, a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reporter said. Only the English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly business edition was delivered Sunday. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> television reported soldiers will be sent to major universities, which have been the center of the pro-democracy protests, to `` keep order.'' Vice Mayor <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baifa </PERSON>, in a televised speech, said more than 200 buses and trolleys were being used as roadblocks around the city. He said city supplies of coal and liquified gas were running low and that the roadblocks hindered the transport of milk, eggs and other staples. Crowds surrounding troop trucks gave the soldiers cigarettes, food and water. Tens of thousands marched Sunday in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, a Western resident reported. Several hundred marched in the coastal city of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, a reporter there said. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony that will come under Chinese rule in 1999, about 400,000 people marched peacefully to support the pro-democratic movement. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, thousands of Chinese studying in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> marched downtown to protest the declaration of martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The standoff in the square began May 13 when students began a hunger strike. The hunger strike was called off Saturday, but the protest has grown to include Chinese from all walks of life. Under martial law, foreign reporters were told they could not conduct interviews, take pictures or make tapes or videos at many locations. The government also banned marches, strikes, class boycotts, distributing pamphlets, speech-making, spreading rumors and any attacks on leaders.

 Up to 40,000 anti-abortion demonstrators turned out for a peaceful rally in downtown <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> on Sunday, police said. Lt. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the demonstrators, who rallied at Kiener Plaza after marching several blocks, gathered without incident and no arrests were made. `` There were no physical confrontations,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` Their adversaries were giving a few catcalls and such but that's about it.'' Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally ever in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the crowd was estimated at 40,000, but several police officers at the scene, as well as pro-choice supporters, disagreed. They said only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were on hand. The `` Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion case which could be used to overturn the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized the procedure in 1973. The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in the case, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services. The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the procedure in publicly funded hospitals and by forbidding the use of public funds. <PERSON> Loretto </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> said rally organizers hoped to impress the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with the number of people who attended. `` This is a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> rally of proud Missourians hoping and praying that the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case will bring down the curtain on this sad era in our country's history,'' she said. Among those addressing the crowd was <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, the wife of Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> was overturned, the power to dictate abortion law would return to the state legislatures, and ultimately to the voters. The rally was sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocesan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and Clergy for Life.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> has become almost a permanent chamber with `` less turnover than the Supreme Soviet,'' and called for fairness in congressional redistricting. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged state governments to set up bipartisan citizen commissions to redraw boundaries after the 1990 national census. `` I think it will be a big issue in the 1990s and I intend to be in the thick of it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a 20-minute speech to more than 4,000 people attending the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 70th Restaurant and Hotel-Motel Show `` I am putting the legislators on notice to keep it fair or they may find the Gipper on the steps of their state capitols calling attention to their shenanigans,'' he said, drawing laughter. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also called for steps to balance the federal budget, saying he was `` working to help future presidents ... get the tools they need to bring the budget under control,'' including a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget and the presidential power to veto a budget line by line. The Republican senior statesman said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, which is dominated by Democrats, `` has become virtually a permanent chamber.'' `` It has less turnover than the Supreme Soviet,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding that 98 percent of the incumbents who ran for re-election last year won. He called gerrymandering _ the rigging of congressional districts' boundaries to assure a majority vote to one party or another _ an `` abuse of power that distorts democracy.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Americans must `` be vigilant and protective of their powers or those powers will be ceded to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` Be strong and courageous ... go to the polls ... take an interest in government, and let your representatives know how you feel ... and what you want,'' he said. He reiterated his support for repealing the 22nd Amendment to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, which limits a president to two terms. `` Since I'm already out to pasture this amendment does n't affect me, but I think it should be repealed,'' he said, labeling it `` another area where the people's democratic rights are being thwarted.'' After his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stayed on stage for 40 minutes to answer questions from the audience, sign autographs and shake hands. Asked what he was doing with his spare time, he noted that he had made a number of speeches in the four months since he left the presidency. `` I'm looking for my spare time,'' the former president joked. `` I'm enjoying it.''

 A revived opposition party urged President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> Sunday to call new elections, and the group's new secretary-general said the president should allow <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return as a sign of her leadership. The call came at the end of a one-day convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The 4,000 delegates agreed to revive the party as the major opposition movement against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> was named party president, Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was designated secretary-general and <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ople </PERSON>, a labor minister under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, was chosen executive vice president, both by acclamation. Laurel quit as foreign secretary on September 1987 and refused to serve in the Cabinet, claiming `` fundamental differences'' with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> remains as vice president, which is an elective post. During the convention, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, a former defense minister, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should display leadership by allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to die in his homeland. `` We believe that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to come back,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. `` There is no reason why he should be deprived of his right to come home at this time of his life. He's so ill. How can he destabilize the country? The former president was reported in critical condition Sunday in a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery. Hospital officials said his prognosis is poor, although he showed signs of responding to treatment. On Friday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return and said her government would not allow him to buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted in a popular uprising in February 1986 that propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has cited national security for refusing previous bids by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come home. `` If Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> feels she is the leader of the country, then she should show that she is, by controlling the situation where her worst perceived enemy is inside the country, not when he is outside and dying,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> played a key role in a military revolt against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, which triggered the `` people power'' uprising that toppled the former president. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> retained <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> as defense chief but fired him in November 1986 after a coup attempt by his followers. Sunday's convention was the latest attempt to put together a unified, viable opposition to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Previous attempts to build an opposition party have foundered because of personal rivalries and the fact that many leading figures are tainted by their previous links to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The Nacionalistas, who suspended activities when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> declared eight years of martial rule in 1972, hope to win the presidency in 1992, when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s term expires. She has said she will not seek re-election.

<HEAD>Building Targeted for Demolition, But Won't Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high-rise building wracked by two demolition blasts leaned precariously but did not fall Sunday, prompting officials to evacuate nearby residents while wrecking crews moved in with a crane. `` We've got one building leaning and one building leaning against it,'' said police Major <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>. `` It's a hazardous condition and I do n't know what could happen.'' A cloud of smoke rose from the bottom of the building around 8:30 a.m., but the 10-story tower remained standing. Patrolman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said demolition crews were not sure why the implosion did not work. The demolition experts, who had used 500 pounds of dynamite in the first implosion, fetched 36 pounds of more explosives and staged a second effort. This time, part of the building tipped slightly and leaned against another tower that may also face demolition, but the structure remained standing. A ball and crane were at the scene, but officials said demolition plans still had to be made. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, head of the city's housing authority, said it could take up to two weeks for the wrecking crews to dismantle the listing building. Police had warned people to watch the second try from home on their televisions after officers had problems with crowding at the site. Three streets were partially cordoned off for the night. <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said a few families living nearby would have to find somewhere else to stay until the building was brought down. Residents without a place to go would be accommodated, officials said. The two towers and one other are the subject of a federal lawsuit filed by Project BASIC, a housing advocacy group, against the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> allowed the tower to be demolished after architects ruled that the building, when being prepared for demolition, was made unsafe. But <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON>'s April 21 temporary restraining order against demolition still stands for the two other towers. Project BASIC contends the buildings are structurally safe and should be preserved because of the need for low-income housing. The housing authority had planned to build smaller residential buildings at the site.

 A small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane used in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s anti-drug effort crashed in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> mountains, killing the six Americans and three Peruvians aboard, officials said Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveridge </PERSON> said the plane went down Saturday afternoon, after it had left the jungle town of <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>. He said the wreckage was spotted Sunday morning. <PERSON> Loveridge </PERSON> refused to provide the names of the passengers. But he said the dead Americans included a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent, two helicopter pilots, the plane's pilot, a mechanic and a security officer from the embassy. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> public information officer, identified the dead <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent as <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, 36, of Ft.. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, Ky <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Yovera </PERSON> said all nine on the single-engine plane died. He said the three Peruvians were a police captain, the 8-year-old son of a police commander and the chief of the U.S.-funded coca eradication program. <PERSON> Yovera </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane was flown by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> contract pilot, and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said it was owned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Yovera </PERSON> said there was no indication of what had caused the crash, but he discounted sabotage because of strict security controls. American personnel in two Peruvian military helicopters from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> were recovering the bodies Sunday, <PERSON> Yovera </PERSON> said. The effort had been suspended Sunday night until the morning, <PERSON> Loveridge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yovera </PERSON> said the plane crashed in a remote area on the arid western slopes of the Andes, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Loveridge </PERSON> said rescue teams aboard helicopters had spotted the plane's wreckage and burned bodies scattered nearby. He said the plane was destroyed when it apparently slammed into a mountainside 15,000 feet above sea level and the largest piece visible from the air was the engine. <PERSON> Loveridge </PERSON> said the last contact with the plane was when the aircraft passed over <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION>, 185 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> is 240 miles northeast of the capital in the lush <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, a jungle-cloaked region on the eastern slopes of the Andes. The valley is the world's greatest source of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has assigned several dozen agents to work with Peruvian anti-drug police in campaigns against drug traffickers in the violent region. In addition to the plane, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has supplied nine helicopters to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> for the anti-drug fight and has contracted private American pilots and technicians, many of them Vietnam War veterans, to fly the aircraft. The Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group controls much of the valley and works hand in hand with drug traffickers, police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say.

 Jurors who convicted a former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policeman of murdering a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> socialite and two others decided Sunday the death penalty should be imposed for each of the three killings. The jury found <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Homick </PERSON>, 48, guilty on May 12 in the killing of oil heiress <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, her maid, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, and deliveryman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The jury began deliberating <PERSON> Homick </PERSON>'s fate on Thursday after listening to two days of testimony in the penalty phase of the trial and an appeal by prosecutors that he be put to death. Sunday afternoon, the jury ordered three death penalties, one for each of the slayings. Formal sentencing was set for June 21 by District Judge <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Homick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officer for 14 months in 1964 and 1965 who has steadfastly maintained his innocence, declared after his conviction, `` My head and my heart are clear.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said the Dec. 11, 1985, slayings occurred when <PERSON> Homick </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> home to rob her of $ 1 million in jewelry he thought she had at the residence. <PERSON> Homick </PERSON> has also been charged in the so-called `` Ninja'' contract slayings of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> couple in September 1985 and with being the leader of a ring that killed an elderly <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> man the same year. In the latter case, a federal indictment returned in March accused <PERSON> Homick </PERSON> of running a criminal enterprise dealing in murder-for-hire, arson, narcotics trafficking and other crimes. Ten others were also charged, including two of <PERSON> Homick </PERSON>'s brothers and his wife.

 Two small airplanes collided in the air along the New Hampshire-Vermont border Sunday, sending one hurtling into a river and killing both people aboard. The other plane landed safely on a highway. State police and eye witnesses said they were amazed that the pilot of the second plane was able to land safely because his windshield had been shattered by what appeared to be a tail piece from the first plane. The pilot was identified as <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He and his passenger, a woman whose name was not released, were listed in fair condition Sunday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hitchcock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, N.H. The dead were reported to be from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, although their names were not released. The two were believed to have been flying out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, N.H. According to police and eyewitnesses, it appeared that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s plane was headed south when the other plane crossed slightly above, heading southeast, at about 1 p.m. `` According to the preliminary police report, the landing gear on one struck the fuselage of the other,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccarelli </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it may be six months before a formal report on the cause of the accident is completed. The collision between the two <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 172s occurred as <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, was playing golf at the <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was this crunch. And the young fellow playing with me looked up at the noise and said, ` My God, those two planes just collided.' I looked up and saw one of the planes veer away to the river and go into a spin. It seemed to take a long time to come down.'' The plane crashed into the <LOCATION> Waits </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, just west of its convergence with the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s plane managed to come down on Interstate 91 a short distance away, police said. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemmis </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION>, saw the second plane land as he was driving north on the highway. `` When I got there, the plane was parked in the breakdown lane like it belonged there,'' <PERSON> Kemmis </PERSON> said. `` It looked natural _ except there was a wing sticking in the right lane.'' <PERSON> Kemmis </PERSON> said that when he got a closer look at the plane, he noticed that the tail section of another plane had shattered the cockpit window and was sticking out over the nose. <PERSON> Ciccarelli </PERSON> said neither plane was under <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> traffic control at the time of the crash. Visibility was 10 miles with haze, he said.

<TEXT>
 About 400 delegates demanding reforms in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called Sunday for the political rehabilitation of Premier <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, executed after the 1956 revolution. The two-day session, which ended Sunday, was the first national conference of the reform movement. It followed a meeting in <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> on April 15 when <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members urged major changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s political structure. In a final resolution, the delegates representing 110 working groups from throughout <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> said an official declaration should be issued rehabilitating <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and state that he was the victim of a `` rigged political trial.'' Conference delegates reviewed the 40 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule after World War II and declared: _ A special congress of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should be held next fall, ahead of the session scheduled in 1990, `` to clear all political issues as to where the party is going. _ Representatives to the congress should be elected at local levels _ The party should reject `` democratic centralism'' _ the principle that the minority should accept all decisions adopted by the majority _ The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should change its name to <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` to reflect its new, democratic character. But the issue of the rehabilitation of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the premier when the Soviets sent troops into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to crush a revolt, was the most emotional issue. The resolution said the rehabilitation should be declared before the June 16 reburial of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s remains. The burial ceremony is to be broadcast by state television but the government has no plans to be officially represented. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who formed a coalition government in 1956 that tried to break with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> pact, and others convicted of revolutionary activities were executed on June 16, 1958. Their bodies were buried in unmarked graves. Earlier this year the government, under intense pressure, agreed to reburial of the bodies and the funeral. A government commission is reviewing <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a reform member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo, told a news conference Saturday the impatience of reformers for a quick decision on <PERSON> Naby </PERSON>'s rehabilitation was justified But he said he would wait until the public prosecutor files a final report, expected sometime this fall. `` Execution for political reasons can not be justified under any circumstances,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> agreed Sunday to move up the scheduled Dec. 10 inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> because of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economic crisis. But <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, in a statement, said no date was set after he and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> held a daylong meeting with aides. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile ordered all banks and foreign exchange houses closed Monday while the government prepared a new economic plan that will include price controls and export taxes. `` I have said and I repeat, I am not going to flee any responsibility,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said late Sunday in a statement read to reporters by press secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. `` Nevertheless, I note that in the context of a severe economic crisis, the period of transition is too long,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said after meeting with his Cabinet. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who won the May 14 presidential election, told the newspaper <PERSON> Clarin </PERSON> in an interview published Sunday that he would take office early `` if there is a general consensus of our entire community.'' He said that would include business, labor and political groups, the armed forces and leaders of the the Roman Catholic church. In the elections earlier this month the Peronists also won virtual contol of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s inauguration in December 1983, following elections that October, ended nearly eight years of military dictatorships. He was barred by the constitution from seeking a second term. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> candidate. Sources in both parties, speaking with the condition they not be identified, said discussions were being held on how to move up <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s inauguration without violating the constitution and if the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also should be sworn in early. Peronist Congressman <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauza </PERSON> said Sunday his party is demanding that <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s economic team resign. `` They are in great measure responsible for this crisis,'' he said. <PERSON> Bauza </PERSON> also said the transfer of power could be held July 9, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s independence day. <PERSON> Bauza </PERSON> is considered to be a contender for finance minister in a Peronist administration. The economic situation is putting pressure on both parties. Interest has not been paid since last year on the country's $ 59 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has only $ 300 million in reserves. Economists say the banking system is in jeopardy. They say about $ 170 million in bonds fall due this week and banks could have trouble raising the money.

 When financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> addressed several hundred ex-shipyard workers, few seemed to care that he'd been indicted in the biggest-ever securities fraud case For them, this man was a messianic cheerleader who pledged to help get their jobs and company back. It may have been <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s high-school cheerleading experience that helped the junk-bond dealer from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, who delivered a rousing speech to the crowd at the local Sons of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> hall. His subject was the Fore River Shipyard, which he promised to help the workers reopen with financing arranged by his former employer, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` When the first ship rolls in here on October first, I look forward to coming back and shaking your hands,'' he said. Ever since <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> closed the 182-acre yard three years ago, workers have dreamed of reopening it as an employee-owned business. The morale-boosting April 27 speech by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, principal defendant in a 98-count securities fraud and racketeering indictment announced a month earlier, was only the latest twist in their saga. <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, a city of 85,000 people south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has a century-old tradition of shipbuilding. Old-timers proudly recount how they turned out the aircraft carriers Wasp and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, the battleship <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the first nuclear powered cruiser, the USS Long Beach. `` It's a family tradition for a lot of us,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Durand </PERSON>, 62. `` I worked there, my father worked there, and my son worked there. It takes skill and pride to pass it on from generation to generation _ and it's something we do n't want to lose.'' The yard was founded in 1884 by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, and was managed after World War II by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, father of the late president. For the first 75 years, it thrived on innovation as wood gave way to steel and sails to coal and oil. When the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shrank after 1945, the yard began a long decline, slipping from a wartime peak of 16,000 employees to 5,000 in 1985 and 1,000 when it closed in May 1986. The next year, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> sold the yard and several buildings for $ 49.5 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, a quasi-public agency responsible for cleaning polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. With support from Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> MWRA </ORGANIZATION> began negotiating a lease with the workers, who formed <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But the workers were frustrated for two years as negotiations foundered on such issues as hazardous waste liability and the <ORGANIZATION> MWRA </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to use some of the yard for its own purposes. The lease, finally negotiated last October, will allow the workers to use 70 acres rent-free for two years. After that, the rent will gradually rise from $ 100,000 in the third year to $ 1 million in the seventh. To keep the workers' dream alive, the state has pumped nearly $ 500,000 into the project. Although most of the former <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> employees have found new jobs, nearly 1,000 have signed cards saying they would like to return to work at <LOCATION> Fore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwyn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> manager who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilders </ORGANIZATION>, said he has talked with ship owners about potential contracts and is optimistic the yard could begin building and repairing vessels again in October. The plan hinges, however, on financing from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, known for its ability to raise huge amounts of money through the sale of high-yield debt securities. Commonly known as junk bonds, the securities are considered riskier for buyers than other forms of corporate debt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president in the investment bank's <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office, approached the workers about junk-bond financing last October, shortly after the lease with the <ORGANIZATION> MWRA </ORGANIZATION> was signed. With <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s help, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> worked out a $ 17.3 million package consisting of $ 13 million in commercial loans, plus a $ 3.3 million investment by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a group of insurance companies. In return for their investments, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the insurance group will receive a 33 percent stake in the shipyard. The remaining 67 percent will go to the workers through an employee stock ownership plan. If the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agrees to guarantee 80 percent of the commercial loans, the financing could be in place by June 30 and the first workers rehired a few weeks later. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executives say that despite <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s appearance at the Sons of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> hall, he has been no more than a cheerleader on the sidelines since March, when <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to dismiss him as part of its own deal to settle securities-fraud charges with the government. `` Prior to the settlement, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was very involved both as a supporter of the shipyard and as somebody who was intimately involved in arranging the financing and helping to structure the transaction,'' <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. But, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> added, `` his role going forward is just as a supporter _ he has no official role either as adviser or financier to the shipyard.'' Nevertheless, some workers still have warm feelings toward the man considered responsible for helping start a flood of corporate takeovers that reshaped corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the 1980s. `` Once the yard is going again,'' said <PERSON> Durand </PERSON>, `` I'd be glad to shake his hand.''

 The threat of sanctions under a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law has pushed some <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries to speed up market opening measures, but also has unleashed counterthreats and claims that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> itself is n't a fair trader. Asian countries lead the list of 34 nations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, in a recent report, said have erected substantial trade barriers against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. The report was the first step in naming countries <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will target for intensive negotiations aimed at eliminating the trade barriers. A decision on the final list is expected May 30. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> headed the list of alleged trade offenders, followed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Other Asian countries named in the report included <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. For decades, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> relied on exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to fuel their growth into industrial powerhouses. If they do not reciprocate by opening their markets to U.S.-made goods, under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act they face possible retaliation in the form of up to 100 percent tariffs on selected imports. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> either must increase exports to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> or slash its imports from the region in order to substantially cut its trade deficit. Over two-thirds of the $ 137.34 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in 1988 was with <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. Acccording to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest trade imbalance was a $ 55.4 billion deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative's report singles out 32 Japanese barriers to foreign imports, including rice, supercomputers, semiconductors, telecommunications and tobacco. Japanese officials have responded to the new trade law by threating to challenge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international trade body. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` can never accept unilateral actions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' and would seek mediation under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, Japanese economic counselor <PERSON> Nobutoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Akao </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stopped short of such action in 1987 when then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered $ 300 million in annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> penalties against Japanese electronics products for alleged violation of a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade. Part of the sanctions have since been lifted. Many Japanese feel their country has done a lot to open its markets to foreign products and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not tried hard enough to sell high-quality products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Some Japanese officials also are angered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> handling of a recent agreement to jointly produce <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next fighter jet. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen demanded a renegotiation of the pact, charging <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> was using it to acquire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology, even though it had hoped to develop the plane alone. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> told a press briefing Thursday that listing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as a serious free trade violator could provoke a strong emotional reaction among the Japanese. In some Asian nations, there was little or no public response to the <ORGANIZATION> USTR </ORGANIZATION> report, but the reaction in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was bitter. Fearing a strong anti-American backlash, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> dispatched top economic officials to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks about alleged trade barriers on agricultural products, telecommunications, government procurement and financial services. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agreed on a new set of import liberalization measures that officials hoped would prevent penalty sanctions. The agreement did not include farm imports. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation would be seen by the public as `` too harsh,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Soon Cho. `` I'm sure it would be adding to instability from which the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government is already suffering.'' There have been sporadic violent clashes between police and farmers in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in recent years as the government gradually opened its markets to imports of wine, cigarettes, beef and other products. Anti-American sentiment has grown, fueled by a dissident-led campaign against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> also has threatened to file complaints with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> and has refused further devaluation of its currency, the won. A weaker won makes South Korean products less competitive in overseas markets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> of manipulating their exchange rates to boost their trade surpluses, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said earlier this month that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has made progress in that area. The <ORGANIZATION> USTR </ORGANIZATION> report charges <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with unfair import licensing, farm subsidies and ineffective protection of intellectual property rights. Taiwanese officials responded they had done much to liberalize the local market and narrow the nation's trade gap with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is extremely unfair to include us in the report,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Siew </PERSON>, vice chairman of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. In March, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> presented a four-year timetable for reducing its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade surplus by at least 10 percent annually. The surplus totaled $ 10.4 billion last year, down 35 percent from 1987. In April, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> announced tariff cuts on hundreds of items and said it would revise laws on insurance and banking and crack down on pirate videos. It has refused, however, to further open its agricultural market, saying it must protect local farmers. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, charged with unfair import policies, export subsidies and poor protection of intellectual property rights, countered by saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threats violate <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules. Commerce Minister <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> called the 1988 Trade Act unfair and said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would pursue the issue to protect its interests. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> also objected to the threat of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade sanctions. <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, which enjoyed a $ 1.4 billion surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988, is under fire for inadequate protection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceutical patents. It asked for more time to deal with the problem and in turn accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of unfair farm subsidies. A Foreign Ministry official who demanded anonymity said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> had its own complaints against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture subsidies. The Americans `` are subsidizing their 11,000 rice farmers by up to $ 1 billion a year, whereas <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has millions of rice farmers who are very poor and can not sell their rice because of subsidies,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> also criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations of unfair trade barriers in agricultural products, especially palm oil, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s main export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> posted a $ 1.7 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year.

<HEAD>Exxon Credit Card Customers Returning Cards by Thousands</HEAD>

 For the past two months, employees at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Card </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> have been under a state of siege as angry customers _ including more than 17,000 who canceled their accounts _ vehemently protested the Alaskan oil spill. Workers at the credit card center here are wearing special gloves to handle protest letters purposedly soaked with oil. They spend hours piecing together torn-up credit cards in order to determine the account numbers that customers want canceled. They apologize on behalf of their company dozens of times a day. `` There are mornings when I do n't want to go to work,'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> said. `` I just tell myself I ca n't let it get to me.'' Many of the returned credit cards are torn to shreds, covered in oil or burned. They also are accompanied by notes reading, `` You ought to be hung'' for the March 24 oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The crisis is taking its toll throughout the Exxon organization. Employees, confronted daily by criticisms of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in the media and by friends and family members, are questioning their faith in the corporate giant. `` It's been deeply painful for every employee that I've worked with, talked with and met,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, a psychologist on retainer with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. `` They feel devastated by what's happened.'' A week and a half into the crisis, one of the women at the card center hung up after a call from an enraged customer and started to cry. One by one, her office mates started crying as well. Her supervisor, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, stood amid them, handing out tissues. `` It'd been building up all week,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said employees are `` embarrassed, they're hurt, they're sad Some are angry, but that passes because they do n't know who to be angry with. It's like a death.'' The company has taken steps to maintain its employees' confidence At <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s downtown building, videos presenting management's side of the story are shown throughout the day. Despondent employees have come up with their own morale boosters. Employees of the shipping company said they were being shunned not only by the public but by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> employees from other divisions. So they printed up buttons proclaiming, `` I Work for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> and I'm proud of it.''
