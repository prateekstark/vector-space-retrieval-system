 A helicopter flying in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last summer only wanted to shoot film for NBC News, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer almost blew it out of the sky when the crew failed to respond to repeated warnings. News helicopters around the world are becoming more aggressive in their quest for the best pictures. Pilots and officials now are taking steps to avoid disaster, to strike a balance between the First Amendment and public safety. Following last May's $ 7-million <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> pier fire near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, news pilot <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tur </PERSON> was criticized for fanning smoke and flames, endangering firefighters, and hampering radio communications with noise. `` We can be a pain,'' acknowledged Tur, who is currently appealing a 180-day license suspension for an unrelated infraction. But he denied he hovered too close, and said that was n't the real reason for his problems. `` People sometimes do n't want publicity. But if the media did n't tell you, who would?'' More news choppers are buzzing the skies above big news events, from earthquakes to chemical spills. Often, it's the only way television crews or newspaper photographers can grab pictures of a distant sea rescue or landslide before deadline. Not too long ago, only the three major television stations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> used helicopters, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreesman </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Helitac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> currently flies for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other news organizations. Nowadays, photographers from such publications as the National Enquirer spend hours each week airborne. `` We ask -LRB- the news helicopters -RRB- to back off and most of them are pretty polite about it,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> of the police Air Support Division. `` Others are pretty persistent. They want to keep taking their pictures and at times it becomes an annoyance.'' These days, teamwork among helicopters begins to play a more important role _ and that's not the most common trait in such a competitive business. `` There's no problem in and around a major event when pilots communicate,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettee </PERSON>, who flies for <ORGANIZATION> KNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only problem is when somebody does something unexpected.'' <PERSON> Pettee </PERSON> said experienced news pilots can shoot a chemical spill without stirring up toxic gas, stay far enough away from a hostage situation to avoid exciting a gunman, and cooperate with other pilots on the scene. Sometimes they even help officials by tracking fires or flying out victims, he said. Complaints were common before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> limited flights around disasters in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said. The restrictions allow local officials to ask the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to declare fires, crashes and other incidents off-limits to aircraft for safety reasons. News aircraft are permitted only if they file a flight plan, fly above rescue aircraft, obey on-site authorities, and follow other rules. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> fire and law enforcement officials said they coordinate coverage with news helicopters as they show up on the scene. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> thinks they have things under control,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>. `` We have n't had any disasters occur with these -LRB- news -RRB- helicopters that I know of anytime recently.'' But last December <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, then-Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, cited helicopter problems in asking the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to tighten controls around disaster sites. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> cited six incidents since 1974 where news helicopters worsened hazards or hampered rescue efforts. These included stirring up fumes and dust around spills of hazardous materials, a fatal crash over a chemical fire, and distracting ground rescue crews. `` These incidents illustrate how non-rescue aircraft can interfere with rescue and clean-up activities and endanger the lives and health of the occupants of the aircraft, the victims of the accident, and the emergency response personnel responding to the fire or hazardous materials incident,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> declined to issue new rules in March, but he pledged the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would impose a 180-day license suspension for pilots ignoring flight restrictions. Tur knows all about such suspensions. The pilot, whose company sells videotape to several television stations, ran into trouble with federal officials in March 1987 over the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet fighter crash that killed <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, son of entertainer <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> honored a request by search officials to issue flight restrictions around the crash site in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, according to testimony at a suspension hearing last September. Tur was warned away from the area by an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel on the scene. But he flew by to shoot late afternoon pictures of searchers combing the steep, brush-filled mountainside for debris and bodies. Other news crews were escorted over the scene at a higher altitude. Tur contended that flights were restricted only to avoid publicity. `` Never can a local, state, or federal agency prevent news media representatives from flying into an area because public relations does n't want the story told,'' he said. But Col. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer at the site, testified news helicopters posed a safety threat. He said <PERSON> Tur </PERSON>'s noisy flight `` significantly disrupted my coordination efforts'' by distracting searchers, and jeopardized their safety Like Tur, the late <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> KUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION>, who was head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, felt the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> crash site was restricted merely to curb publicity. `` I think it's obvious if it was not <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s son there would not have been a -LRB- restriction -RRB- in effect,'' <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> said in an interview a few weeks before his own death in a helicopter crash. <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> and cameraman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> were returning from covering a plane crash Oct. 19 when their helicopter became entangled in a utility cable and crashed southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Both men were killed. Blocking or limiting media helicopters, <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON> said in the interview, `` prevents the public from seeing events that they're entitled to see under the First Amendment.

 In Japanese this country is called Nippon or sometimes <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION>, and therein lies a seed of debate. `` Why is our country called <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? Its ` official' name is <PERSON> Nippon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> wrote in a letter published in September by the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, provoking a minor flood of other readers' letters. The 26-year-old student from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> argued that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should `` unanimously use Nippon'' as its own name on the international level _ on athletes' uniforms when they compete abroad, for instance. One of the editors of <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION>'s letters section thought the flurry of response and comment was slightly alarming _ a possible sign of nationalistic feelings at a time when Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was gravely ill. `` It is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue especially under the current situation, when the emperor's illness has been affecting the country,'' he said, asking that he not be named But the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be used to debate the issue. `` I guess it would be easier if we could choose one -LRB- name -RRB-, but we can not decide which should be legitimate,'' he said. Not everybody is sensitive about the country's name, or worried that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is getting nationalistic. A foreign relations specialist and conservative writer, <PERSON> Hideaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kase </PERSON>, said, `` I think it's fine to have a few different names. There seems to be no problem using either <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or Nippon. ... It has nothing to do with nationalism.'' A Foreign Ministry official said there are no rules on how to name countries in other languages, and he noted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is spelled <PERSON> Japon </PERSON> in Spanish and pronounced like `` hapon.'' But what should Japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for international competition? No one but the Chinese would be able to recognize <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s name written in the Chinese characters, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago, so it has to be written in the Roman alphabet, called romaji in Japanese. <PERSON> Kayoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' for international athletic events. `` For major international events, we use <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the country's official name, because English is the most common language,'' she said But there's no firm rule, and some teams also go with <PERSON> Nippon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Obana </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volleyball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the national volleyball team has both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> uniforms but players wear Nippon more often in international contests. `` Either way, they're our country's names. We do n't think we should be using only one of the two,'' <PERSON> Obana </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>'s letter was published, the volleyball association received many inquiries asking which name is official, because Japanese volleyball players wore their Nippon uniforms at the summer Olympics games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> editor said the newspaper, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-largest circulation daily, received about 10 letters on the issues. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blahitka </PERSON> from <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> prefecture in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wrote that she was against using Nippon because many languages as well as Japanese translate foreign countries' names into their own tongue, and English-speaking countries are no exception. `` For example, <PERSON> Bundesrepublik </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> is the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or colloquially <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in English, and ` <PERSON> Nishi </PERSON> <PERSON> Doitsu </PERSON>' in Japanese,'' she said. Teacher <PERSON> Tatsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Akizuki </PERSON>, 36, wrote: `` It is a huge task to change the way a country's name or person's name, which has already become fixed in our daily lives, is pronounced.'' `` If Japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and names of people in the languages of the respective countries, we would be in trouble,'' he added. The origin of the name <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not certain, but researchers say it probably came from the Malayan `` Japung'' or the Chinese `` Riben,'' meaning roughly land of the rising sun. Historians say the Japanese called their country <ORGANIZATION> Yamato </ORGANIZATION> in its early history, and they began using Nippon around the seventh century. Nippon and <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> are used interchangeably as the country's name

 A newspaper columnist's beef about litterbugs got him into trouble on the city streets he's trying to keep clean. A few weeks ago, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLeon </PERSON> wrote a column criticizing litterbugs and criticizing himself for not standing up to them. He swore, in print, that next time he saw a litterbug, he would say something.

<HEAD>Bendjedid Reinforces His Authority For Further Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, promising to usher in a new era of liberal reforms, solidified his power during a meeting of the nation's only party and virtually assured himself of another five years in office. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up its two-day congress late Monday night by electing a new, 155-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which then designated Bendjedid as its secretary-general. The head of the party automatically becomes sole candidate in the presidential elections, which the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> set for Dec. 22. Bendjedid thus will win a third five-year term as head of this one-party socialist state. But Bendjedid now must confront the growing economic and social problems that exploded into bloody riots in early October. Official reports said 176 died in the protests, but unofficial estimates put the death toll at 500. `` I need your help because the mission is difficult, the task is long and the problems are great,'' Bendjedid told the 5,078 congress delegates in his closing speech. `` The renewal of your confidence is a support for the political reform proposals, of which a part already have been applied and others are going to be. I promise to do my best to implement your political program.'' Many Algerians, however, were hoping that the congress would approve a multiparty political system. <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> said during the congress that such a move was possible in the future, but he contended it could harm national unity at the present time. It was not know at the end of the congress what form <ORGANIZATION> Bendjedid </ORGANIZATION>'s reforms would take The October riots were staged by Algerians upset with high unemployment, rising prices and a shortage of housing. The protests prompted Bendjedid to promise a more liberal political system and less central control. Bendjedid has been trying for the past two years to institute reforms, particularly breaking the grip of the party on the day-to-day running of the country. That effort was accelerated by the violence in October. He told the congress that a package of reforms would be presented to Parliament soon, but did not detail what they would contain. <PERSON> Abdelhamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehri </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the party, said that although a multiparty system had been rejected for the immediate future, free candidacies for some elected offices would be allowed. That means non-party members may run for local assemblies and the national <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The new <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was comprised almost equally of delegates elected from local cells; from government and party functionaries; and from union and professional organizations. That appeared to bring in the new blood <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> was seeking and end the domination of party militants that characterized the outgoing committee. After the October riots, the government quickly held a referendum to win approval of the first phase of reforms. Those consisted mainly of changes to the constitution. Among those changes was according new power to the premier and making him directly responsible to the Parliament rather than the president. Shortly after the Nov. 3 referendum, <ORGANIZATION> Bendjedid </ORGANIZATION> appointed a new premier, <PERSON> Kasdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON>, and a government made up largely of technicians rather than professional party militants. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s debt is estimated at $ 23 billion. The nation also has faced a dramatic fall in the price of oil _ the country's main export _ during the past two years, and an unemployment rate of 22 percent.

 A young reserve soldier whose face was burned and mutilated by a firebomb went on television to ask fellow Israelis to show some understanding and stop staring at him. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, a 25-year-old university student, was doing his required duty in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> last June when Palestinians hurled a firebomb at his jeep. His face was disfigured and all his fingers had to be amputated. He decided to appear on an Israeli TV talk show Monday night, he said, because his countrymen react so cruelly when they encounter victims like himself in public. `` All the stares lock on you,'' he said. `` Sometimes it's helplessness, or even fear ... People just have no tact and they shout things, like, ` Look at this weirdo, look at this creature!' `` As though we are not living in a country where people should know about this phenomenom. It happens a lot and I'm not the only one; there are a lot like me.'' <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>'s entire face is covered with burns and scar tissue. His ears were burned off. His fingerless hands are still wrapped in bandages. He appeared on TV with his girlfriend, <PERSON> Miri </PERSON> <PERSON> Amiel </PERSON>. They began dating about six months before he was hurt, and Ms. <PERSON> Amiel </PERSON> said they were closer now than ever. `` Before, we were like any couple, going out together, studying together, having fun. ... Now we have to deal with all these things together,'' she said. `` Of course, <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> has to deal with it more than I, but I am a partner in everything.'' They met at college, where he was taking a preparatory course before studying for a degree. <PERSON> Amiel </PERSON> said she, too, is pained by the public's reaction. `` It's very sad for me ... to see all the stares, and hope that <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> does n't notice,'' she said. Tragedy struck <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> at 11 p.m. on June 14, the last day of his unit's 24-day tour of duty in the occupied areas. His jeep entered <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Umar </LOCATION> village for one last patrol before returning to base for a farewell party. `` I did n't want to do the extra round because it was late,'' he said. `` I felt a ... strange feeling. ... After a moment or two I felt the Molotov cocktail. All of me was burning. ... I could n't open the door to get out of the jeep. Since then, <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> has undergone more than a dozen operations and skin transplants. He said he began crying when he realized what he looked like and `` my brother and my girlfriend ... also started crying. ... A few minutes later I said, O.K., guys, calm down, everything will be all right, this is n't going to break me.'' The television showed a photograph of <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amiel </PERSON>, taken before the attack and portraying a handsome young man in army uniform. `` I was always a pretty realistic and rational type,'' <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> said. `` This new situation is not simple and not easy ... but it wo n't help to complain or ask why I look like this.'' He said he was appealing to Israeli society to be kinder to burn victims not for himself but because other burn victims were more sensitive than he. At least 10 people have suffered serious burns in firebomb attacks in the past year _ a frequent weapon in the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising that has killed more than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis. <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> said he harbors no desire for revenge and no feelings of hatred toward the Palestinians who attacked him. He said Palestinian insurrectionists have `` a struggle of their own, and the way they're doing it, with violence, they wo n't accomplish anything They must sit and talk this problem out.''

<HEAD>Town Meeting Backs Off Ban On Plastic Food Containers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A town meeting Monday endorsed the idea of reducing the use of polystyrene coffee cups and other plastic food containers but backed down from a complete ban on the non-recyclable materials. A group called <ORGANIZATION> Foam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> sponsored the proposal to ban the sale of plastic foam food containers in the town of 35,000 people, home to <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Townspeople voted instead on a substitute motion calling on the town to `` endorse the goals of reducing the use of non-recyclable plastics,'' educate vendors and users about cutting back, and encourage use of alternatives. There was no discussion of the original motion at town meeting. But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutcheson </PERSON>, who sponsored the substitute measure, said Foam Free Amherst supported the replacement. The motion passed by voice vote. The aim of the original proposal was to discourage the use of plastics because they take up considerable space in the town dump and create gases that deplete the earth's ozone layer when manufactured and burned, according to sponsor <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Polystyrene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, defended the plastic by saying that researchers have found fast-food packaging takes up only one-quarter of 1 percent of landfills in weight and volume. Moreover, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCampos </PERSON> said, the polystyrene industry has voluntarily agreed to stop using chlorofluoromethane in the manufacture of plastic cups by January out of concern for the earth's ozone layer. <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> was one of several communities across the nation to take a closer look at polystyrene cups and consider bans that DeCampos called `` a quick fix to the solid waste issue.'' Bans already are in effect in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, N.Y. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has issued an executive order effective July 1989 banning state agencies from purchasing plastic foam food packaging.

 In a city where image is everything, city planners are prescribing a face lift. They're recommending `` designer'' sidewalks, flower planters and novel street lamps to counter fears that cracked sidewalks and traffic-clogged streets will send shoppers elsewhere. `` It's a critical step forward in giving a face lift to a city which is in desperate need to maintain its beauty and attractiveness and keep its kind of garden-spot-of-the-world atmosphere,'' Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanenbaum </PERSON> said. The entire revitalization plan for the 30-block business district could run $ 80 million. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it would study the proposal. Plans include $ 2 million for flower planters, $ 715,000 for sprinklers, $ 10.4 million for scored concrete sidewalks with granite bands, $ 3.3 million for street lamps, $ 1 million to widen sidewalks on Rodeo Drive and <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>, $ 1.5 million for pedestrian gateways and $ 1 million to landscape the middle of <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. `` Are we slipping?

 Stumped for a Christmas present for the person who has everything? How about a bridge. The state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has honest-to-goodness historic bridges available to anyone who will give them good homes and will haul them away. But seriously, who would want a bridge? Cities, counties, park and recreation districts, land developers _ anyone who wants to preserve some road history and save some of the enormous cost of building a new trestle is interested in the bridges, said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, staff historian for the department. Bridges in the 3-year-old `` Adopt-A-Bridge'' program are scheduled for replacement because they are deteriorating or impractical for modern traffic. Eighteen bridges, most made of steel trusses, are eligible for the program, <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> said. But so far only three have reached some stage of being moved mainly because of the difficulties in relocating them. Moving expenses vary. For example, to disassemble and relocate all four, 185-foot-long spans of the Fifth Street Bridge in Grand Junction is estimated to cost between $ 360,000 and $ 480,000. For a single span: $ 120,000.

The fuel could cause fire or explosion if used in heating devices, Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` We've got squad cars going up and down streets in two police districts using their public address systems to warn people, and officers are handing out flyers to people on the street,'' <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` We're also getting very good cooperation from radio and television stations,'' he said. On Saturday, a fuel company delivered gas to a <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> service station, but mistakenly poured 1,640 gallons into a kerosene tank, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` They did n't discover the error until early Monday,'' the lieutenant said, `` but they estimate that there were about 4,100 gallons of kerosene in the tank. `` That would make the mix about three-to-one,'' <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` The owner estimates they sold from 730 to 800 gallons of the kerosene before learning that there was gasoline in it.'' By late Monday night, consumers had returned at least 200 gallons to the station, and only one minor fire had been linked to the mixture, officials said.

 At least one of the 100-odd American ambassadors that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must select could rank in importance with many of the Cabinet choices now drawing most of the nation's attention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must select the successor to former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, retiring after a record 11 years as ambassador to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The job is important simply because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has become so important to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the late 20th Century. Together the two countries account for 40 to 50 percent of world economic output. They have one of the world's most complex, emotionally-charged and changing relationships. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> calls the U.S.-Japanese relationship the most important in the world and says that during his tenure in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> it has changed from that of uncle-nephew to brother-brother. Complicating the love-hate feelings often felt between the countries are deep cultural and language differences and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new world importance. In only four decades, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has transformed itself from a humble, defeated <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> enemy to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protege and loyal ally, an economic superpower and rival, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> creditor, landlord and occasional critic. During the election campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took positions on issues such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military and foreign aid role and trade. To demands that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increase military spending and relieve some of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense burden, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ a bomber pilot against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in World War II _ noted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbors still remember the war and `` remain very sensitive to the issue of Japanese rearmament.'' He suggested that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rapidly boost its share of global economic aid, a category in which it is about to surpass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But that, too, could create other conflicts, because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is already becoming a rival to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance of such international institutions as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. On trade, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to take President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s general line of seeking to brake protectionist efforts to restrict Japanese imports into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while encouraging sharpened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, the Japanese prime minister from 1982-87, developed a first-name relationship unprecedented in the two countries' history. Their personal connection helped the nations weather a rough period marked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure against Japanese domestic barriers, alleged unfair trade practices and insular thinking inappropriate for a country grown rich by exporting. <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s successor, said during a White House visit that he also had gotten on a first-name basis with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> news reports say he hopes to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency to cultivate the same kind of relations. After 14 years as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader, <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by Democratic President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. In 1981 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked him to stay in the increasingly important post. Announcing his retirement, <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said he felt he could leave `` with our heads high.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, accounting for $ 57 billion of a global deficit of $ 170 billion in 1987, is finally narrowing, he said, as a result of hard-bargained market-openings, the costlier yen and cheaper dollar and efforts by <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to boost Japanese domestic consumption and imports. But new flareups can be expected between two countries that have such different backgrounds but are now so economically interdependent. Pressure from the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to shoulder more defense costs promises to affect U.S.-Japanese relations. Members ask why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with all its deficit problems should spend 6 percent of gross national product on defense, while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> devotes just 1 percent of its wealth to the same purpose. But <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials dispute the idea that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> enjoys a `` free ride,'' arguing that it provides the bulk of the destroyers and combat jets in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, that its military budget of $ 30 billion a year is already higher than that of any other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, and that its contribution of $ 45,000 to the annual upkeep of each of the 55,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the most generous in the world. Tension also continues over an issue raised by presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other Democrats, the `` buying up of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' in the form of Japanese investments in prime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate and factories. Defenders such as <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> ask why nobody complains about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s $ 75 billion worth of direct investment in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, compared to Japanese investments of $ 33 billion. Names mentioned as early candidates for the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> post include <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs, who has served in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs; and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> governor instrumental in bringing Japanese factories to his state. Economic relations between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` are so large and so crucial to both countries that unless we manage them intelligently, we could be facing a crisis of enormous dimensions,'' says <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> programs at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based private research organization. `` If the Japanese did n't buy our <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, our debt would be simply unmanageable,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> says. `` No other country is in that position.''

<HEAD>Black Ink in Farm Trade More Than Doubles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm exports soared to a six-year peak of 147.5 million metric tons in the year that ended Sept. 30, and black ink in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade doubled to more than $ 14 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was again the top customer of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmer, as it has been for more than two decades, according to figures released Monday. American farm exports climbed from $ 27.87 billion in fiscal 1987 to $ 35.2 billion this past fiscal year, a gain of 26 percent, while imports of farm products were up 2 percent to a record $ 21 billion, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was thus left with a net agricultural trade surplus of $ 14.2 billion for fiscal 1988, compared with $ 7.22 billion a year earlier. Volume of exports climbed 14 percent from the 129.2 million metric tons posted in fiscal 1987, with wheat accounting for two-thirds of the increase, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. A metric ton is equivalent to about 2,205 pounds. Exports of wheat increased from 28.2 million metric tons in 1987 to 40.5 million tons in the last fiscal year. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> together purchased a total of 14.6 million tons, or 36 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat shipments in fiscal 1988. Combined imports by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> totaled 4.95 million metric tons of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wheat in 1987, or 18 percent of all shipments. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imported 27.8 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural goods. Other leading purchasers were: the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, 25.5 million metric tons; the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 15.9 million metric tons; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 8 million; and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, 7.3 million. Besides wheat, substantial gains were posted by corn, grain sorghum, feeds and fodders and vegetable oils. Among products not measured on the basis of metric tons, the biggest gains were in baby chicks, live animals, fruit juices, wines and malt beverages. The increases were moderated, however, by weakened foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans, soybean meal and rice. All of the nation's leading foreign markets for farm goods grew in fiscal 1988 except that of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, whose imports dropped nearly 1.1 million metric tons. The decrease mainly reflected fewer purchases of soybean and soybean meal. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were among the five fastest-growing markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture, joining <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. American high-value exports such as livestock and horticultural products climbed to a record $ 16.4 billion in 1988, a gain of $ 2.7 billion or 19 percent over the 1987 level. It also represented a $ 1.1 billion gain over the previous peak, reached in 1981. Shipments of bulk commodities such as grains zoomed 33 percent from 1987 to a total of $ 18.8 billion. The level topped $ 25 billion in 1984 before immense crop surpluses and stiffer foreign competition battered prices and sent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture into the doldrums. Expanded purchases of wheat and corn were the main reason for the increase, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were the leading markets for wheat and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were tops for corn. Agricultural imports of $ 21 billion were some $ 250 million or 2 percent above the 1987 level and about $ 100 million over the 1986 mark of $ 20.9 billion, the previous record high. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the increase was not limited to any single commodity group but instead reflected modest increases in nearly all major competitive items. Top suppliers were: the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4.12 billion; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, $ 2.37 billion; <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, $ 1.9 billion; <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, $ 1.9 billion and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, $ 1.15 billion. Products reflecting increases were vegetable oil, live cattle, beef and veal, wines and malt beverages and nursery products. Imports of sugar, pork, fur, coffee and spices all dropped.

<HEAD>Administration Opts Against Limitation on Bearing Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The domestic bearing industry is operating at or near 100 percent capacity, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said in declining to limit imports of the friction-reducing components from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The decision, announced Monday, follows a joint study by the Commerce and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had found separately in July that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing manufacturers would not be able to meet `` all national security requirements in the event of a major conventional war.'' But President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in August tentatively ruled out limits until the joint study could be completed. The administration wanted to ensure that the domestic bearing industry would be sufficiently healthy to meet production needs in the event of an emergency, without the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> having to rely on outside suppliers. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the joint study found that conditions in the domestic bearing industry had improved signficantly in the last several months. His statement said that it was concluded that `` administration initiatives should be adequate to bring the domestic industrial base into an acceptable posture for national security purposes.'' Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision was made `` after a thorough review of the impact of bearing imports on national security.'' `` While recognizing the critical importance of bearings to defense preparedness, other administration initiatives already under way _ coupled with significantly improved economic conditions for the industry _ make me confident that this is the right decision,'' he said. The decision against moving to curb imports of bearings was based on these conclusions of the government investigators: _ Current demand for bearings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is at its highest level in recent years, particularly as bearing-consuming industries such as automobiles, aerospace and off-road equipment experience heavy sales increases _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing industry has benefited from substantial increases in domestic demand and is operating at or near 100 percent of capacity _ The industry has attracted `` significant investment'' from both domestic - and foreign-owned _ A change in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acquisition guidelines last August, which now require the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to use only domestic industries for the purchase of bearings for defense-related equipment This could provide the domestic industry with an estimated $ 40 million to $ 50 million in additional revenue for domestic suppliers. In a separate and unrelated action, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` aggressively pursuing'' an investigation of alleged unfair trade practices by foreign suppliers of anti-friction bearings. `` Our preliminary findings indicate dumping margins in the 20 to 80 percent range,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If the final results of this investigation verify these margins, the duties imposed could contribute to leveling the playing field for this important industry.'' He said that a final determination on the issue of dumping of bearings by foreign competitors in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market will be due Jan. 9, and a decision will be made 45 days later on what kind of actions to take. Dumping is the selling of a product in a foreign market at a price lower than the domestic price.

 <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, signed on for another hitch as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, says President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will have new ways of dealing with the press'' that may include more informal meetings with reporters. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, 46, has been President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman since February 1987 and was Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary for two years before that. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, making his first appearance in the White House press briefing room since his election Nov. 8, announced Monday that he is retaining <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. It is the first time the press secretary of an outgoing president has been named permanently to the job in a new administration, although <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> served President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for an interim after President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to say how frequently <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would hold presidential news conferences, saying: `` The vice president has been holding press conferences at the rate of one every five hours for the last few weeks, so we'll have to see how that works out. `` The new president, I'm sure, will have new ways of dealing with the press. I'm sure there will be all kinds of interviews and press conferences and meetings.'' When a reporter observed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems more comfortable than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in freewheeling give-and-take with reporters, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I would agree with you that the president-elect is comfortable with the press, he does operate informally quite effectively.'' `` So I would suspect you might see a lot more informal _,'' the spokesman said, at which point his response was cut off by a reporter's question as to what he would recommend in the way of news conferences. `` I wo n't talk about all the things I've recommended and not recommended, but we'll just have to wait and see,'' he said. `` I think there should be as much contact with the press as possible and it should be as regular as possible,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> is a veteran public affairs official whose federal career began in 1972 when he was a speechwriter for Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON>. Before that, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had worked for newspapers in his native <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` I think he's the best,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He represents the old and the new. He represents the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and he also represents the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. ... This is continuity in the best sense.'' When asked if he would hold more frequent news conferences than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the president-elect said, `` I ` m going to lean heavily on <LOCATION> Marlin </LOCATION> for advice on this.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s present title is assistant to the president for press relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in the new administration <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> will be press secretary, a title held now by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. When asked whether <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would have a role in the new administration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I know the vice president is very interested in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and concerned about his well-being'' and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers `` have some ideas of things they would like him to do.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> would remain <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary through the transition, and he would take over on Jan. 20. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> has said she plans to leave government. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left the briefing room, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> opened his presentation with a few words of gratitude to the president-elect and president. Then a reporter asked him, `` Well, will you keep avoiding briefings and will you promise to hold more news conferences?'' `` A two-minute honeymoon,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Amazing.''

<HEAD>US-Soviet Grain Agreement Extended for 27 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hailed the new U.S.-Soviet grain agreement as providing a steady market for American farm products, but a congressman from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wheat belt said the deal sold growers short. The plan `` stabilizes grain trade between our two countries by ensuring a secure source of supply for Soviet grain imports and secure market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain exports,'' said a statement from <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meetings. Under a 27-month extension of the long-term agreement between the two nations, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is promising to buy at the equivalent of at least 9 million metric tons annually of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. A metric ton equals about 2,205 pounds. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators signed the extension in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday, breathing new life into a five-year plan that helped to turn the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmer's best customers. That agreement had expired Sept. 30. `` The extension will continue to stabilize grain trade between the two countries, benefiting American farmers,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement. The agreement calls for the Soviets to buy at least 4 million metric tons each of wheat and corn annually as well as 1 million metric tons of additional wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal, or any combination of those commodities. The Soviets also are allowed to purchase up to 3 million metric tons of additional wheat and corn annually without further discussions. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said the pact has `` done nothing more than maintain the current agreement. `` This was an historic opportunity with one of our most important grain clients and all we can say is we did n't lose any ground,'' he said. `` That simply is n't good enough.'' `` This administration has driven down the price of grain in order to export more, but they do n't seem to be able to close the deal,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets bought 9.05 million tons of wheat, 5.18 million tons of corn, 830,700 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery in the fifth and final year of the current agreement. The Soviets purchased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for the final year and a half of the old agreement at federally subsidized prices under the government's Export Enhancement Program, designed to offset competition from the European Community and other suppliers. Under the 1985 program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> pays private exporters in kind out of stocks held by the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to ship the grain at highly attractive prices. There are no dollar estimates for these sales. A provision of the old plan carried over into the new version allows the Soviets to count one ton of soybeans or soybean meal as two tons and thus round out their purchase obligation by buying 500,000 tons of those commodities rather than a million tons of wheat or corn. `` In general our impression is favorable,'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> said. `` It's a continuation of what we had before, which worked fairly well.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said his members were pleased with the agreement but had hoped that the amounts would have been a bit larger. In any case, he said, the plan was likely to have less effect on prices than will lingering problems caused by the drought. He said markets mainly would be relieved to get some assurance of continued Soviet demand. `` It's like a security blanket for some people,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>GEORGE M. MITCHELL: Made His Name in Iran-Contra Hearings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago as an appointee who had never won election to public office. But the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat has since proven himself a popular vote-getter, a thoughtful lawmaker and a telegenic party spokesman. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a former federal judge, won praise for his incisive questioning of witnesses before the Iran-Contra investigating panel last year. He also hushed the hearing room with a statement as dramatic as the emotional testimony of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` Although he's regularly asked to do so, God does not take sides in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> lectured the Marine. `` And in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, disagreement with the policies of the government is not evidence of lack of patriotism.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra performance solidified his status as a potential majority leader. He was first mentioned for the job in 1986 when, as the hard-working head of the Democrats' senatorial campaign committee, he led his party back to control of the chamber. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 55, had less legislative experience than his two opponents for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader and was perceived as more liberal. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental protection subcommittee, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> led a losing fight this year for an anti-pollution bill designed to reduce acid rain, smog and airborne toxic chemicals. His powerful opponents included the current <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s health panel and has proposed a major long-term health care initiative. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to succeed <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, whom he had served as an executive assistant two decades earlier. He won election in 1982 with 61 percent of the vote and garnered 81 percent this year. The son of a utility company laborer and a Lebanese immigrant mother who worked the midnight shift at a woolen mill for 27 years, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, spent two years as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer and worked as an insurance claims adjuster while attending night classes at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> lost a 1974 bid to become governor of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He was appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the state in 1977 and two years later was named to a new federal judgeship in <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, the most senior of three candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, is known for his solemn, deep-voiced presence which commands attention whether during a floor debate or at a hearing. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, who has been a senator since 1962, earned national prominence first as keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 1968, then gained added respect as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watergate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. But the gloss was dulled somewhat last year when <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> was criticized for not keeping a firm enough handle on hearings before the Iran-Contra investigating panel he helped chair. In that post and as former <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman and a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> has prided himself on being able to work closely with Republicans. But he also has been a party loyalist, backing President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s Vietnam War policy and defending Sen. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, in 1981 against expulsion in the Abscam case. His colleagues made him secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 party leadership position, leading many to rank him a year ago as the top prospect to succeed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as majority leader. But in recent months, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>'s chances seemed to fade as some _ particularly newer senators _ searched for a less ponderous figure to represent their numbers on television. Last year, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> was embarrassed after it was revealed that he had slipped into a money bill $ 8 million for a school in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for North African Jews. He later was forced to rescind the provision. In recent years, his voting record has tended toward the liberal side: he has favored gun control, sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and limits on political action committee contributions to candidates. He has opposed the Star Wars defense system and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> is an accomplished power broker with a reputation of knowing how to swing legislative deals while protecting his own interests. The Louisianan is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and of the energy and water development appropriations subcommittee, posts from which he watches out for his state and its energy industry. That was seen by some observers as a possible disadvantage in his race for majority leader, since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already is led by another oil and gas advocate, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. While known for an easygoing, quotable style, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> is quick to master details of legislation, has a strong grasp of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> procedure and is considered a cagey backroom deal-maker. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> was more conservative than either of his two rivals for majority leader. During his second term, he was a leading opponent of court-ordered busing to desegregate schools. But he now casts himself as a centrist. He dramatically came out against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of conservative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year, supported a bill aimed at reducing pollution that causes global warming, and fought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s efforts to finance the Star Wars missile defense system. In the majority leader's race, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> sold himself as the candidate most likely to appeal to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and thus as the best standard-bearer for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He picked up endorsements from two of the party's stars, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Now 56, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 after a nine-year career in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state legislature.

<HEAD>Study: Environmental Concerns to Influence Farm Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmental concerns are likely to influence the next comprehensive farm bill and threaten some farmers' incomes unless agricultural interests adopt reforms on their own, a researcher says Farmers must `` modify programs, or agriculture must be prepared to face environmental legislation,'' says <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichelderfer </PERSON>, coauthor of a paper released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and Agricultural Policy. The center is part of the environmental research organization Resources for the Future. The study noted that 37 states have passed or are considering legislation aimed at agricultural contamination of water. Agriculture is already the largest source of some pollution, such as nutrients reaching waterways. Pesticides have been found, for example, in 40 percent of the wells in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The paper surveyed existing research documenting environmental harm from farming as practiced today with massive government involvement in restricting acreage, supporting farm income and controlling supply. Growing environmental concern could mean modification of farm subsidy programs or new environmental controls that could reduce the income of some farmers, the study said. `` The net effect of the current combination of farm program instruments include the following: More acreage is retained in the agricultural sector than would be the case in the absence of farm programs, but less acreage is cultivated and agricultural chemical use rates and crop yields per acre are higher,'' the study said. Ending all price support programs while keeping current conservation requirements would `` increase the number of acres planted to crops, but would result in environmentally beneficial relocation and mix of production activities, with less intensive and less damaging use of agricultural chemicals on expanded acreage,'' it said. However, `` farm income would decline, agricultural exports would fall and rural communities and agribusiness interests would suffer.'' <PERSON> Reichelderfer </PERSON> said the environmental benefits `` probably -LRB- would -RRB- not'' outweigh the costs. Nonetheless, `` polls have shown what I consider a rather dramatic increase in public concern about agricultural sources of pollution, particularly contamination of drinking water sources,'' she said. `` You're probably going to see even more participation by the environmental community'' in shaping the next farm bill, tentatively on the congressional agenda for 1990, said the study's other author, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON>. Environmentalists were influential in adding the `` sodbuster'' and `` swampbuster'' provisions to the 1985 bill, forbidding subsidies to farmers who convert grasslands and swamps to crops, and in fashioning the conservation reserve, aimed at retiring 45 million acres of erodible land from production through rent payments to farmers who convert it to grassland or forest for 10 years. The paper discussed in detail three possible modifications to current programs: removing the link between production and income support that current commodity-oriented price supports provide; gradually ending all price supports; and expansion of the conservation reserve. Other possibilities mentioned were taxes on pesticides, subsidies to encourage so-called `` low input'' farming or low-chemical `` integrated pest management,'' and more research on alternatives to chemical-dependent farming.

 A Japanese department store said today that it bought <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for a record $ 38.46 million and plans to sell the Rose Period masterpiece to a buyer in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The pink-and-rose painting of two circus performers sold Monday for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art created in this century. It also was the third most expensive work of art ever auctioned. It is surpassed only by two late 19th century paintings by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> sold in 1987, `` Irises'' at $ 53.9 million and `` Sunflowers'' at $ 41.3 million. <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mitsukoshi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that its representative <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishino </PERSON> bought the <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> painting at the <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on behalf of the store. `` We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer here in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. But he said the store, which is a major importer of art into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, had not decided on specific plans for displaying or selling the painting. <PERSON> Nishino </PERSON> left the crowded saleroom after buying the painting and slumped in a chair in a private room for 20 minutes. He did n't speak to reporters but wore a big smile. A director said the man was emotionally exhausted. `` We offered him a glass of champagne but he did n't like it and had <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> instead,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrey </PERSON>, spokesman for the auction house. `` The buyer told me he had bought a most wonderful masterpiece. He did n't question the price _ he was very excited.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of investment. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> Fire and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' when it was sold at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in March 1987 Dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art sales are to Japanese buyers, often large corporations that buy for tax-free investment purposes. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> painted `` Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' in 1905 in his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> attic studio at 13 rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque watercolor easier to handle than oil paint. After being shown in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1905, it found its way into a German museum and was confiscated by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1937 as an example of decadent art. They sold it at auction in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to a Belgian collector, and it had been in private hands since. Bidding on Monday opened at $ 9.2 million, and the painting sold in 3 -LCB- minutes. The selling price topped the previous record for a 20th century painting, $ 24.75 million paid for <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Maternity'' Nov. 14 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Auctioneer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Allsopp </PERSON> said the price was not exorbitant. `` By any standard, <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> was the towering figure of art in this century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series likely to come on the market,'' <PERSON> Allsopp </PERSON> said. `` In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture. It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who do n't like <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>. A picture by the French Impressionist <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, `` The Railroad Bridge at <LOCATION> Argenteuil </LOCATION>,'' sold for $ 12.55 million, also joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at auction. In June 28, another <ORGANIZATION> Monet </ORGANIZATION> painting, `` In the Field,'' sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for $ 24.90 million. Monday's auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought $ 102.01 million, a record for an Impressionist and modern art sale in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Individual records were set for works by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacometti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Signac </PERSON>.

 Twenty peasants and a civilian liaison officer were tortured and burned before they were strangled by leftist guerrillas last week, an army spokesman said. The guerrillas' coalition denied that rebels were responsible and blamed the army for the massacre. The victims, found Saturday night in common graves near <LOCATION> Chimaltenango </LOCATION>, about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were tortured before they were killed, army spokesman Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said on Monday. He denied a report that the victims were members of a death squad and repeated government claims that guerrillas were responsible. The government said on Sunday that guerrillas killed <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, a civilian who worked with the military in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguacate </LOCATION> town and who disappeared last Wednesday. It said the guerrillas then massacred 20 friends and relatives who organized a search party Friday and went looking for him. In a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guatemala </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla umbrella organization, called the government charges `` totally and absolutely false'' and said the army was trying to cover up involvement in the killings.

The army and government blamed the killings on guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION>, which, with the <ORGANIZATION> Rebel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the Poor, form the coalition battling the U.S.-backed government. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the victims `` did n't have bullet wounds ... but suffered torture and finally were strangled to death.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim 266 Government Casualties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas said they killed or wounded 266 government soldiers during a week of fighting and said they were increasing their attacks in the capital. The casualty claim was broadcast Monday on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos The broadcast provided no other details on government casualties and did not report rebel losses for the period Nov. 20-26. Radio Venceremos is run by the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella coalition of five rebel groups fighting the U.S.-backed government for the past nine years. The <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said eight rebels were killed and 30 more wounded in clashes with government troops Nov. 18-25. It did not report government casualties. Rebels also claimed responsibility for the assassination last week of the mayor of <LOCATION> Sesori </LOCATION>, about 95 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Monday's broadcast accused Mayor <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Villafuerte </PERSON> of collaborating with an army counterinsurgency battalion operating in the area. The army had said <PERSON> Villafuerte </PERSON>, of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped on Wednesday. His body was found Saturday outside <LOCATION> Sesori </LOCATION>. Monday's rebel broadcast said urban guerrillas were stepping up their operations in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital. `` The war is increasing on the outskirts of the capital where permanent guerrilla forces and units operate constantly,'' it said. Urban guerrillas on Friday boarded a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> city bus and shot to death two soldiers and wounded a third, officials said. One passenger was killed and three were seriously injured in a firefight between the rebels and soldiers aboard the bus, a hospital spokesman said. On Wednesday, urban guerrillas killed a soldier on a bus and wounded another in a similar attack.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher; Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen Tuesday, and share prices sharply rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 122.15 yen, up 0.15 yen from Monday's close of 122.00 yen. Opening higher at 122.50 yen, the currency fell slowly but steadily while ranging between 122.00 yen and 122.51 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 380.27-point loser the previous day, regained 334.98 points or 1.2 percent to move back to 29,318.30. The index gained 79.53 points shortly after the market opened and rose markedly during the afternoon session. The dollar's rise in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed an advance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that dealers attributed to the increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime interest rate and to an agreement by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to reduce crude production. Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks boosted their prime lending rates by a half percentage point to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to set a daily production quota of 18.5 million barrels, down from its estimated 22.5 million-barrel current production, and a target price of $ 18 a barrel. The announcement triggered $ 1 a barrel increases in oil markets. Oil generally is priced in dollars, and higher <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prices raise demand for dollars to pay for the oil. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> called the effect of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement on exchange rates mostly psychological, and said the pact would not have an immediate effect on the world economy. An exchange dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said he did not expect any heavy dollar-selling in the market before the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures, due out Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The market bearishness toward the dollar remains, but dealers were reluctant to sell further until they see the figures,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Nikkei Stock Average finished the morning session at 29,051.30, up 67.98 points from Monday's close. On Monday, the index fell 380.27 points to close below the 29,000-point mark for the first time since Nov. 16. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, many institutional investors stayed on the sidelines watching movements in overseas markets ahead of the upcoming release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product and unemployment figures, dealers said. Estimated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP statistics for the July-September quarter were scheduled for release later Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Puget Sound `Spreads'; Some Worry About Dilution Of Identity</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY9</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Puget </PERSON>, circa 1792, would be proud. The meager waterway bearing his name has grown to encompass much of western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inland sea lanes, but critics say the expansion dilutes the Sound's identity. Some would stretch the edge of Puget Sound even farther _ to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s door _ but a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> guide and amateur historian says Puget Sound has gone far enough. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, author of guides to the trails of western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, would put the cutoff point near the north end of the <LOCATION> Kitsap </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, across from the southern tip of <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. To make his point, he would draw the line at <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> No </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` It dilutes the identity of Puget Sound to spread it over too much water, and it lessens the identity of the other waterways,'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Pilotage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a 25-year veteran of the state ferry system, agreed with that assessment. Any chart clearly shows that cutoff mark is the place where Admiralty Inlet links the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> with Puget Sound, he said. However, the borders ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Names </ORGANIZATION> do n't quite comply with that description. And those with commerce in mind have much more divergent views. `` We figure ourselves as being on the north end of Puget Sound,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of Point No Point. Puget Sound `` includes us,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bellingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said being part of Puget Sound, even when one is not, helps promote the area to outsiders. `` It gives an association with the larger metropolitan area of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` For the most part, we promote this area as being part of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, but when people ask us where's that, we say in Puget Sound, north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. That disregards such waters as <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Passage </LOCATION>, the Strait of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and the bays of <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. Those who extend Puget Sound past certain borders to include `` everything wet except martinis and rain'' are wrong, he said. The real names will die as newcomers are fed the `` Puget Sound'' pablum, he said. `` They do n't have the right to make such a radical change,'' he said. Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vancouver </PERSON>, the British explorer, first used the name after he sailed into the region's inland waters in 1792. He named the southern waters of what is now Puget Sound after one of his ship captains, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Puget </PERSON>. The name applied only to meandering inlets south of what is now <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. The main channel north of the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Narrows </LOCATION> to the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON>, named by earlier <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> explorers, was named Admiralty Inlet. In 1869, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the description of Puget Sound to a general `` all the waters connected with the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> within the territory of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Resigns After Plagiarism Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the nation's top psychiatrists resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s faculty after a student at another school recognized plagiarized passages in the professor's writings dating back 22 years. Dr. <PERSON> Shervert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, 67, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, resigned last week as a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor and head of <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a psychiatric hospital affiliated with the university. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> did not dispute the findings of a faculty committee that investigated the allegations, but said the plagiarism was inadvertent, according to Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON>, dean of academic programs at the medical school. `` He has accepted the evidence of the committee,'' <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON> said. `` But he has ascribed the events to his method of note-taking and composing papers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday the plagiarism was spotted by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scatena </PERSON>, a graduate student in cognitive sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scatena </PERSON> said in a telephone interview he read several of <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>'s papers while researching phantom pain, a burning sensation that patients sometimes feel from a limb that has been amputated. <PERSON> Scatena </PERSON> said he found many incorrect citations in the papers and recognized paragraphs that had been lifted from articles by other researchers. He said he sent the passages to Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosteson </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, in August. <PERSON> Tosteson </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>'s resignation in a Nov. 23 letter to the faculty. The letter, made public by the university Monday, says a faculty committee investigated the allegations and concluded that plagiarism occurred in four papers written by <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> between 1966 and 1975. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Monday. Spokesmen at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said he was out of town and unreachable. He did not return messages left at the hospital, and the phone at his home went unanswered. Three of the discredited papers are about phantom pain. The fourth is on `` psychiatric emergency management.'' The papers, which were published in medical journals and textbooks, were intended as `` teaching instruments'' and did not purport to present new research data, <PERSON> Adelstein </PERSON> said. One of <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>'s colleagues said he thought the forced resignation was an overreaction. `` It's not as if he stole a great idea from someone or published someone else's research as if it was his own,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Kety </PERSON>, professor emeritus of psychiatry and senior scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. But Dr. Miles Shore, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Academic institutions have a very important obligation to guarantee the scientific integrity of what goes on within their walls and I think <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> took the appropriate action.'' And <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> said: `` The university takes very seriously any charges of plagiarism because that's what we're about _ the search for truth and knowledge. The university has been hit by other allegations of scientific misconduct in recent years. In 1981, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darsee </PERSON> was stripped of his position as a heart researcher for allegedly falsifying data. This year, <PERSON> Scheffer </PERSON> C.G. <PERSON> Tseng </PERSON> left his post at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Eye and Ear Infirmary after he was accused of changing his test methods and violating <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s conflict-of-interest rules in promoting an experimental eye drug. Also this year, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> issued new guidelines for researchers in an effort to prevent academic fraud. The school also said it would consider appointing professors on the basis of only five to 10 papers, a move aimed at reducing the `` publish or perish'' pressure that sometimes underlies fraud. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> was a professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> from 1972 until 1984, when he left to become director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. He returned to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to become head of <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, one of the nation's leading psychiatric hospitals. He has worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, among other institutions. He is a former commissioner of mental health and mental retardation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Defense Rests Without Calling Any Witnesses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The attorney for a pathologist accused of murder in the mercy killing his cancer-stricken wife rested his case without presenting any testimony, saying the state's evidence was weak `` Surprise, your honor, the defense rests,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, attorney for Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, said after a lunch break Monday. `` I do n't think they came close to proving any crime.'' <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who rejected defense requests for acquittal and a mistrial declaration, scheduled closing arguments for Wednesday. He said he would meet with attorneys today to prepare jury instructions. Rosier, 47, is charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of his terminally ill wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, nearly three years ago. During the Thanksgiving weekend, <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> discussed strategy with his client. He said he considered putting the <PERSON> Rosiers </PERSON>' two children, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 22, on the stand as character witnesses. The decision to rest without calling a witness was not made until Monday, the attorney said. The decision means <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> will have the final say to the jury in rebuttal remarks. The prosecution contended Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> failed in a suicide attempt by taking 20 Seconal sedatives. Rosier, a retired <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> pathologist, then bungled an attempt to kill his wife with morphine injections and suppositories, so Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>'s stepfather, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, smothered her to end her suffering, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> contended. The doctor hoped to profit from his wife's painful death through his unpublished book, which he wanted to turn into a screenplay, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> maintained. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> wanted to commit suicide to avoid a horrible death from cancer that had spread from her lungs to other organs, said <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>. Rosier acted out of compassion and did nothing that could have killed his wife of 23 years, <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, 43, died Jan. 15, 1986. Her lagging health and death were chronicled by a Fort Myers television station. Broadcasts quoting <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> as saying he played a role in her death prompted the murder investigation. Before prosecutors knew of <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>'s role, he was given immunity in return for his testimony.

 More than 850 people were arrested in unrest between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis, and portraits of Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> have appeared on the streets of the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital, Soviet media reported. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> printed an interview with 26-year-old <PERSON> Nemat </PERSON> <PERSON> Panakhov </PERSON>, said to have led rallies by thousands of protesters on <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>'s Lenin Square. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> correspondents asked him to explain why `` we saw green flags and portraits of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on the square.'' It quoted <PERSON> Panakhov </PERSON> as saying leaders of the protests rejected such appeals to Moslem fundamentalism. Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem, and their neighbors the Armenians are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. Both republics border on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is concerned about the possibility of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalist Moslem revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> spreading across the frontier to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. No new outbreaks of violence were reported in the troubled southern republics, where at least seven people, including four soldiers, were killed in ethnic violence last week. A strict curfew remained in effect several cities, including <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> and the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. Soldiers and tanks patrolled the streets. The Soviet TV news program `` Vremya'' said most factories in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> were closed Monday and the situation in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> remained `` complicated and strained.'' Official <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio, in a report monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said 867 people were arrested in the Azerbaijani capital on Sunday night and Monday morning, and that 18 of them were jailed. Quoting a report from the city's military commandant, it said, `` There were about 10,000 people on <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> while the curfew is in force, many citizens are staying away from their houses and these people are violating the special situation.'' Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Khachik </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamultyan </PERSON>, a recently elected deputy to the Armenian Supreme Soviet, was detained and later released for speaking to a crowd on a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> street. <PERSON> Stamultyan </PERSON> is a member of the committee pressing to have the predominantly Armenian enclave of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is inside <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and national authorities have rejected such a move. `` There is nothing new in the town -LRB- <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. `` Soldiers ask any group of more than three to disperse, even knots of people at bus stops.'' Officials and the state media have said three of the four dead soldiers were killed in the first wave of violence last week in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Nakhichevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops stepped in to control rioting. The fourth death was reported Sunday in the military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, which said a soldier was run over deliberately by a truck. The remaining three victims were Azerbaijanis, killed in <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION> by soldiers for violating the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, according to a local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official.

 A Chinese activist said in an essay published today that foreign countries should invest in his country only on condition the Communist government makes progress in human rights. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON> also criticized <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of depriving its citizens of `` basic rights of citizenship'' such as voting in meaningful elections. His comments appeared in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> paper said the essay broke a 10-year silence by the activist, who was jailed for four years after figuring prominently in the Democracy Movement of 1978-79.

In the essay, translated from Chinese to English by the newspaper, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> recalled the movement he helped spearhead: `` The Democracy Wall dared to expose the problem of life-long tenure in office, the fact that ` ownership by the people' is state ownership, the existence of unemployment and surplus labor, and many other economic truths'' about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he wrote. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has opened to the outside world and sought overseas investment in a bid for modernization. But <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> urged foreign countries not to place more money in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> until certain changes occur. `` Industrially developed countries investing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and providing economic aid should take into consideration the reform of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s social structure, the expansion of democratic institutions, and the release of political prisoners,'' wrote <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, a 44-year-old electrician. `` Progress on these fronts should be a condition for investment. Enhancing the power of an unreformed state suggests greater suppression of the people, who will sooner or later react.'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> frequently returned to the theme of democratic change, which he said was essential to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` In 1949, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came to power through force.

<HEAD>Report Suggests $400 Million For Antimatter Research And
Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 400 million investment could help scientists harness antimatter, perhaps leading to faster spacecraft and better ways to treat cancer and detect flaws in complex machines, a <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> study says. `` We are on the threshold of important advances in the basic science of antimatter and its practical applications. But as tantalizingly near as that may be, the rewards can not be realized without a program such as we are advocating,'' said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON>, a physicist at the think tank. The Rand report stems from a 1987 meeting of 80 experts on antimatter. They detailed experiments needed if they are to harness antimatter. <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> determined such research would cost about $ 400 million over 10 years. Recognizing federal budget deficits, the Air Force-sponsored report stopped short of urging the expenditure, although it said such spending would be warranted. Rand said the government, universities and industry should spend $ 30 million jointly over three years to modify an atom smasher to produce one quadrillion antimatter particles annually and to develop devices that can store the particles, called antiprotons, for practical uses. `` Antimatter has a very buzzwordy, gosh-gee-willy impact upon the general public. People immediately think of ` Star Trek,''' but the exotic substance really exists, said physicist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. For each type of particle in matter, there is a corresponding particle of antimatter that has the same mass but an opposite electric charge. Protons are positively charged particles in atoms of matter. Antiprotons are their negatively charged antimatter counterparts. `` If you had a twin brother made out of antimatter, you would literally annihilate each other in a big explosion of light and energy if you came into contact,'' said <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>, who co-edited a book of technical papers from the 1987 conference. Such explosions could be harnessed as rocket fuel, although that would be the most difficult practical application to develop, <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said. Antimatter is a promising rocket fuel because a tiny amount can produce as much energy as a huge tank of chemical rocket fuel, `` so you only have to carry a small amount of antimatter into orbit to carry you to Mars,'' <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said. Antimatter-powered spacecraft would be lighter, faster and able to carry heavier payloads farther than existing rockets, <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> said. If the $ 400 million is spent, antiprotons could be available in a decade for radiation therapy for cancer patients, he said. Unlike existing methods, antiproton beams could be targeted so precisely the particles would destroy only a tumor with minimal damage to intervening tissue, <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> said. Compared with X-rays, CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging, antiprotons should produce more accurate, easier-to-interpret pictures of the inside of the human body to help doctors diagnose cancers and other diseases, <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said antiprotons also would expose patients to much less radiation. Pictures made using antiprotons instead of X-rays also should make it 1,000 times faster to detect and weld cracks or other flaws in industrial materials and machines such as airplane parts, rocket nozzles and turbine blades, <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said a reliable source of antiprotons also would help physicists `` study the fundamental properties of matter and antimatter, and the fundamental forces which act upon them.'' The report said antiprotons could be mass-produced by modifying an existing proton accelerator, either at <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, or at <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Three existing atom smashers, or particle accelerators, now create antiprotons, but each yields trillions of the particles each year, far fewer than scientists need. Storing antimatter requires keeping it from contact with matter. <PERSON> Augenstein </PERSON> said magnetic fields could be used to hold them in `` ion traps'' or keep them circulating in storage rings.

<HEAD>Romanian Leader Backing Off Village Razing Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> appears to have backed off from a controversial plan to raze up to 7,000 villages, many of them home to ethnic Hungarians. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, speaking Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, made no mention of criticism from the West and from neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which fears the plan will destroy the cultural heritage of about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The village plan, made public in April, called for the razing of the villages and the resettlement of residents in new housing in `` agro-industrial centers.'' Romanian officials said the plan was aimed at gaining more farmland for use by state-owned collective farms. But some foreigners, including former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Funderburk </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s motive was to wipe out evidence of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s capitalist and religious past. `` By destroying much of what is creative and beautiful _ historic churches, monuments and fortresses _ in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s past, Mr. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> hopes to separate the people from their culture and heritage,'' <PERSON> Funderburk </PERSON> wrote last month in the British magazine The Economist. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> cited the need Monday to preserve unspecified communes, or groups of villages, to prevent depopulation of the countryside. `` We have in mind the preservation of the number of communes and in a few counties even the development of a few communal centers which have been depopulated,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the official news agency Agerpres. He said many Romanians were migrating to towns to work in factories, where they get higher salaries than in agriculture. `` That's why resolute measures are needed for preventing the depopulation of rural settlements, for organizing them on a modern basis and creating conditions likely to provide inhabitants with everything they need for a decent, civilized life,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s comments drew differing interpretations. `` It's clear that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is backing off from his original statements, not because of mounting international opposition but due to lack of money and materials,'' said a former high-ranking official in the Romanian party who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to a summary of the speech distributed by <PERSON> Agerpres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> departed from recent practice by not once mentioning the controversial village scheme by name. Last spring, he said at least half of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 13,000 villages `` must disappear.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is holding its three-day meeting to review <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s long-term economic plans until the year 2000. <PERSON> Agerpres </PERSON> did not say why the meeting, originally scheduled for September, was delayed for two months.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s slightly relaxed rules for dormitory guests do n't go far enough, said a student who helped organize vigorous protests of a ban on overnight visitors of the opposite sex. University President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> on Monday announced he had accepted the recommendations of a task force that decided to allow some overnight guests. The task force of parents, students, faculty and school officials was commissioned after thousands of students demonstrated against the ban. <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> limited overnight guests of the opposite sex to family members. Visits between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. would have to be approved in writing by all roommates 24 hours in advance. But students remain forbidden from being overnight hosts to unrelated members of the opposite sex, and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 27,000-student private school, said the rules changes probably wo n't go into effect until next fall. The recommendations do n't make the rules palatable because they do n't substantially change the original decision, said <PERSON> Susheel </PERSON> <PERSON> Srikonda </PERSON>, who, along with another student, formed a group called Active, Concerned, Together -LRB- ACT -RRB- to fight the new policies. ACT wanted to take a different approach that would emphasize roommate approval and give the resident assistants who are in charge of dormitories a larger role, he said. `` They are not changed that much,'' said <PERSON> Srikonda </PERSON>, a 20-year-old computer science major. <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> disagreed. `` The initial policy that was proposed was that there be no overnight guests,'' he said. `` The tone of it was to discourage overnight guests. This is saying that there certainly can be overnight guests. It describes the format in which that can occur.'' The ban, announced in September, drew wide attention, including that of television talk-show host <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, who visited campus to interview administration officials and student leaders. <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said he approved the ban because parents `` are, in a proportion of about 30 to 1, -LRB- were -RRB- opposed to overnight visitors of the opposite sex.'' He conceded the university, which has a dormitory population of about 8,500, can not police dormitories rigorously but said the school is obliged to discourage certain behavior.

<HEAD>China Claims Artifact At Sotheby's Auction Was Stolen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s withdrew an ancient bronze vessel from a sale of Chinese artifacts scheduled for today after the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government said the item had been stolen in June from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> museum. The item was withdrawn from the auction of `` Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Arts'' at least two weeks ago after <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s received a description of the missing museum piece from a representative of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, said a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> He said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s was holding the ritual vessel, called a dui, pending a resolution of the dispute between the owner and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. According to the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> office notified its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterpart Saturday of the theft, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police met Monday with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official to ask <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s help in recovering the object The Chinese government report said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police identified the dui from a color photograph in a Sotheby's catalog, which did not identify the owner and said it was expected to sell for $ 60,000 to $ 80,000. The vessel was made during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Warring States Period, from 475 B.C. to 221 B.C., a period of conflict among rival princes before what is now northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was unified under the first emperor. Chinese police say the dui in the catalog is identical in shape, decoration and patina spots to one that was stolen June 4 from the Qu Yuan Museum in <LOCATION> Zigui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province. The thieves remain at large. The dui was excavated in the county in 1983. An expert at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Palace Museum said craftsmen at the time the piece was made were unable to cast identical bronze pieces. Millions of dollars worth of artifacts are smuggled out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> each year, most through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Some are stolen from museums, but most are discovered by peasants in their fields or by tomb robbers, and the sites are wrecked before archaeologists can study them. <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON> said an auction `` would actually be the worst possible place'' to dispose of a stolen object because the process _ which includes the publication of photographs and detailed descriptions of every item _ is so public. In April, <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s withdrew a bronze statue of a Roman god from auction after experts determined that the statue belonged to the <LOCATION> Musee </LOCATION> des Beaux Arts et d'Archeologie in <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The statue, worth $ 5,000, had been stolen in 1914, and was being sold through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction house by the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> museum acquired it in 1953 from a donor who apparently did not know it had been stolen. Two scholars who saw the statue in a Sotheby's catalog questioned its authenticity, speculating it might be a copy of the missing bronze. Experts determined that, in fact, it was the missing bronze.

<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top arms control expert has resigned as co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and Arms Control because of the procedure used to appoint the center's faculty. Physicist <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Drell </PERSON> complained Monday that he was `` stymied'' in efforts to build a multidisciplinary faculty because university rules say center appointments must come through existing departments such as history or science. The center's students and scholars come from a wide variety of departments and one-fourth of the university's graduating seniors now earn degrees in such programs as human biology, international relations and public policy. <PERSON> Drell </PERSON> said appointments of some of the center's best students to professorial positions have been blocked because of university rules. The center recently was cited by an independent, foundation-sponsored evaluation as the premier trainer of students and scholars in arms control, sharing honors with the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusettes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> for its research work. <PERSON> Drell </PERSON>'s resignation is effective next Aug. 31. He will return to the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as deputy director. `` With my departure, several of my outstanding younger colleagues, who have helped me build a strong research and training program in technical issues of security and arms control, are now planning to leave,'' <PERSON> Drell </PERSON> said. `` I hope that this loss is only temporary and that before too long new means can be designed within the university structure to rebuild this part of the program.'' University officials conceded the appointment procedure is a problem. `` His evident disappointment with the administration's response to his request points up a difficult problem for us, and the provost and I will continue to wrestle with it in consultation with the faculty,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Earlier this year, the faculty senate created an ad hoc committee to study the entire appointment process. <PERSON> Drell </PERSON> said he was sure the issue would be discussed by the committee. <PERSON> Drell </PERSON> is a close friend of Soviet physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and has been a government advisor on arms control for more than 20 years. He's played a fundamental role in the direction of Star Wars research, advocating continued study but criticizing some aspects of the program.

<HEAD>Rabin Urges Labor To Join Likud-led Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> urged his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today to consider joining a coalition government led by the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to keep out smaller parties whose demands for religious legislation has angered American Jews. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has offered Labor two senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministries if the left-leaning party joins a broad-based government. Labor leaders are meeting Wednesday to consider the offer, and some party officials predicted a showdown between Laborites willing to compromise and those who want to sit in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as an opposition party. `` The public is worried about the country and not about settling small scores,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reality we are facing requires the party to seriously examine the possibilities of establishing a broad-based government.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has offered Labor the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, meaning <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> would be able to keep his job if Labor joins the government. `` In the first stage after the elections, the two large parties pursued the religious parties in an exaggerated way, and I was a partner to that,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said, referring to the parties' offers to pass religious legislation. `` It is clear to us now that this included promises to change things that could create a rift between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Jewish nation. ... It seems to me if there is a possibility to prevent this, it will be by establishing a joint government,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 parliamentary seats to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 39 in Nov. 1 elections for the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. It was chosen to form the government because of its alliances with small right-wing and ultra-Orthodox religious parties. But the religious parties' squabbles over Cabinet posts and their demand for controversial legislation have entangled <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s effort. The religious parties want a law that would accept only conversions to <PERSON> Judaiam </PERSON> performed by Orthodox rabbis, angering American Jews who mostly belong to the Reform or Conservative movements. Among the stumbling blocks to <ORGANIZATION> Labor-Likud </ORGANIZATION> negotiations to form a government are whether <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> will offer its left-wing rival an equal number of ministries and what job Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> will get. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is now foreign minister, but his party and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have sharp differences over foreign policy that became stronger in the election campaign. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> pressed in the campaign for giving up occupied land in exchange for peace and opening negotiations with the Palestinians through an international peace conference. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refuses to give up any of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and offers to negotiate only a limited autonomy for Palestinians, with the final status of the occupied lands to be worked out later. <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baram </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s general-secretary, predicted a tough fight within the party over whether to join a Likud-led government. `` I am against negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, and I will express this in the Labor meeting. I believe there will be stubborn resistance in the party's central committee,'' he said. If Labor joins a broad-based government under <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, it would be similar to the Cabinet that has ruled since 1984 elections gave neither Labor nor <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> enough seats to form a government without the other. In the new government, however, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would likely be prime minister for the entire four-year term. Under the power-sharing agreement reached after the 1984 vote, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> each held the top post for two year.

 Doctors treating surrealist painter <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> today said his condition improved slightly overnight, although it remained extremely critical. The 84-year-old artist is suffering from severe heart trouble aggravated by blood clots in the lungs, government spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> said. After a brief visit to Quiron Clinic to see <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s doctors said `` he is better now than he was last night. He has improved despite remaining in extremely critical condition.'' `` His doctors say he has serious respiratory problems complicated by heart trouble,'' but doctors are encouraged by his strong `` will to live,'' she said. She said <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> had asked for a television or a radio in his room to permit him to listen to news coverage of his hospital stay. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, one of the founders of the Surrealist movement and one of the best-known living artists in the world, is the last member of an outstanding generation of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> painters that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, who died in 1973, and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, who died a decade later. <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Pasqual </PERSON> <PERSON> Maragall </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> early today for 10 minutes and told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> `` is lucid and responds quickly when spoken to with a very vital look.'' `` He has difficulty breathing,'' the mayor said. `` His doctor says he is very critical and that there is a 48-hour period of caution to determine exactly the danger he faces.'' News reports indicated <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> had suffered a cold for several days last week. He developed pneumonia and heart trouble, causing his medical team to rush him to a local hospital Sunday in his hometown of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>. On Monday night, doctors ordered him transferred by ambulance under police escort to the Quiron Clinic in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, 60 miles south, where he was immediately placed in the intensive care unit for treatment, his doctors said. Since August 1984 <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has been in poor health as a result of third-degree burns he suffered in an electrical fire that broke out in the bedroom of his home in the village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pera </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>. The brush with death kept him bound to a wheelchair or in bed and required that he be fed by tube. A team of nurses watched over him around the clock since the fire. In July 1986 <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> received a heart pacemaker in surgery done in a <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> hospital. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has lived in seclusion and suffered from frequent bouts of depression since the death in 1982 of his wife, <PERSON> Gala </PERSON>, his principal muse during a 50-year period of his career.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the 10 men who will take their places as freshman <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators next year felt awed by a sense of history, but others simply wanted to find their way from here to there. Monday was orientation day for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> class of 1988. And while the five Democrats and five Republicans all talked of tackling the federal government's massive deficit, their immediate concerns were more mundane: staff and office space, telephones, security and legislative procedure. Committee assignments were a pressing matter. There was much talk of exactly how low their place will be in the pecking order of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s seniority system. `` Everybody's worrying about numbers _ whether they'll be number 95, 96, 97, 98 or whatever,'' said Sen.-elect <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, R-Mont. `` I said, ` Boys, you ca n't get any lower than 100!''' That's <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' number. One hundred _ and dead last in seniority. Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., figured he would be about 94th in seniority when all was said and done `` What does that get you?'' he was asked. `` Not very much, to tell you the truth,'' he replied. There are other numbers involved. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, an ardent amateur historian who keeps track of such things, says that since the first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convened in 1789 there have been precisely 1,782 <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> When the 10 newcomers are sworn in with the convening of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January, they will be numbered 1,783 to 1,792, depending how on the final determination of their seniority is made under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s complicated rules and procedures for such things. But for now, some of the members of the class of'88 were fairly glowing, even as they paid attention to what several called the `` nuts and bolts'' details of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> life. `` It's a special day, a red letter day, a very personal day that you'll never forget,'' said Sen.-elect <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis. `` But it's also like going to college as a `` Think of it. Father and mother immigrants _ 65 years ago _ had nothing. And now their son is a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator.'' The son has a little more than nothing. A multimillionaire who spent some $ 5 million on his election campaign, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> farm broadcaster who upset Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., was asked to name the biggest challenge he faces as a new senator `` The biggest challenge to me is getting from here to there without walking through all these cameras,'' he said, waving a hand toward the forest of television cameras sprouting from the floor of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> corridor. The new Democratic senators quickly found themselves the center of attention from three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veterans _ Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION> All sought votes in their bids to succeed <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he would vote for <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> because `` he's a person I feel comfortable with.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said he would make up his mind at the last minute, adding that because he did n't know any of the three candidates all that well, `` it comes down to a decision you make in your gut.'' Still, there was a sense of wonder at being in a position to make such a choice at all. `` I feel a sense of history,'' said <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>. `` It's not going to be an easy time to be a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator,'' he said, citing budget deficits, taxes and environmental problems. Sen.-elect <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, a Democratic former governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, was told that the most frustrated senators are former governors, shorn of the ability to make executive decisions on their own authority. `` Thou sayest it,'' said <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, who had little to say on any other subject. Three members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt. _ are moving across the Capitol to the For <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, being one of 100 senators is a lot better than being one of 435 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with its restrictive traffic-cop rules. `` You have a much greater opportunity in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to influence legislation on the floor,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. But for <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, becoming a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was n't an automatic step up. He gave up his No. 2 position in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership to run for the seat being vacated by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss., a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran `` You look at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and there certainly are a lot of differences,'' <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> grumbled. `` Like why it takes three months in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to move in 10 guys when in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> they move in 43 people in 30 days.'' One new senator-to-be, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state Republican <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, was making his second debut as a freshman. He was defeated by Democrat <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in 1986 but reinstated by the voters on Nov. 8. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for eight years, was asked if he had any advice for the newcomers `` I'll tell them to pray a lot,'' he said, grinning.

 An attorney for convicted Nazi war criminal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> died today after jumping from the 15th story of an office tower in an apparent suicide, a police spokesman said.

The appeal had been set to begin Monday. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a former district court judge who recently joined <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s defense team, died at 8:30 a.m. after hurling himself from an upper floor of the City Towers office complex in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` He jumped from the 15th floor,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` There are no other details.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported police found bits of polish from <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>'s shoes on the sill of the window that he jumped from It said the window was in the lobby of the <ORGANIZATION> Ayalon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, which is located on the building's 15th floor. The radio said <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> entered the hotel's empty lobby without the receptionist noticing him. The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was convicted in April of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers in which 850,000 Jews died at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who lived in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Seven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> before being extradicted to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1986, claims he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> served for 17 years on the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> bench before retiring in 1983.

 A Cabinet minister with the power to close newspapers is demanding damage payments from a major paper because it published an article poking fun at him and a critical letter from a reader, the newspaper said today. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s action against The Star follows similar demands last week directed at a black newspaper he has already closed once, and at the editor of an anti-apartheid newspaper now under suspension. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has the power under the 29-month state of emergency to close newspapers without giving reasons. Three newspapers have been closed temporarily by him this year. State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive. The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, through the state attorney, was demanding 100,000 rand -LRB- $ 41,800 -RRB- for defamation and impairment of his dignity. The newspaper said police are also investigating it for alleged violations of laws dealing with the police and prisons, because of a photograph and a guest editorial it published. On Friday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> demanded damage payments from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, a black newspaper published by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, for publishing excerpts of a speech by <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harber </PERSON>, co-editor of The Weekly Mail. In the speech, <PERSON> Harber </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s three-month banning of his newspaper and referred to the Cabinet minister as narrow-minded. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is threatening to sue <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Harber </PERSON> a total of 100,000 rand -LRB- $ 41,800 -RRB- unless they pay him directly. The Weekly Mail is due to resume publishing Friday. New Nation resumed publication June 30, after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> banned it for three months. The government also has threatened action against a new Afrikaans-language weekly, <PERSON> Vrye </PERSON> <PERSON> Weekblad </PERSON>, for allegedly promoting the aims of outlawed organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s allegation that The Star defamed him is based in part on a feature Nov. 13 in the paper's Sunday magazine. The article said, `` On the political gossip front, it's hard to beat the restaurant at the Houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. This star-studded setting inspires comments like, ` <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s the only man I know who walks upright without a spine.''' The other item in The Star cited by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was a letter to the editor from a reader, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON>, published on Nov. 14. The letter described <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as `` a greater danger to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> than the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>,'' and criticized the banning of The Weekly Mail. The Star said police were investigating the paper because of an Aug. 23 article by a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sash </ORGANIZATION>, a civil rights group, criticizing pending legislation to increase evictions of black squatters and because of the publication of a photograph of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. It is illegal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to publish pictures of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, but a Star editor said the only picture of him the paper had published was one taken from a government publication. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the chief guerrilla movement fighting to overthrow the South African government and end apartheid.

 A man accused of robbing a bank could n't resist the urge to do a little Christmas shopping, so he hired a taxi outside the bank and rode from store to store for more than an hour before he was arrested By the time police caught up with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, on Monday, the cab was stuffed with shopping bags full of shirts, shoes and pants, officers said. `` When you've got the money, you might as well spend it,'' the cab driver, who asked not be identified, quoted his passenger as saying. According to police, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> phoned for the cab at about the same time <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan was robbed. Authorities did not release the dollar loss in the robbery, a policy followed with federal banks, said <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schott </PERSON>. After hopping into the cab outside the bank, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> stopped at the <LOCATION> Sarasota-Bradenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to buy plane tickets, and then visited several shopping centers _ running up a cab fare of $ 26.70. `` I was cracking up most of the time I was in the cab with him,'' said the cab driver. `` He was having a good time.''

 A judge has opened an inquest behind closed doors into the death of a police cadet who collapsed on the first day of training, one of 16 cadets from the class who were hospitalized. `` The bottom line is to determine whether or not one or more persons violated criminal law or acted in criminal negligence,'' District Court Judge <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblatt </PERSON> said in an unusual news conference before the proceeding began Monday. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, died Nov. 2 of blood poisoning and other complications from the heat stroke he suffered Sept. 19 at the regional police academy in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. Fifteen other cadets among the class of 50 were hospitalized for exhaustion and dehydration. He lingered for 44 days and underwent a liver transplant. <PERSON> Goldblatt </PERSON> said his report and witnesses' testimony will be made public only if there are no grounds for criminal charges. But if the judge sees evidence of a crime, the report and testimony will be submitted to the district attorney, who will proceed to a grand jury, he said. The judge also plans to visit the <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> academy, one of six regional centers operated by the state to train local police. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s brother, father and widow were among the dozen people at the inquest. `` I hope anybody responsible for <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> being where he is right now will be paid big time,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>. `` I want them punished ... all of them.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashim </PERSON>, an attorney for the <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> family, said he expected the testimony to take at least three weeks. The judge's report is expected to take several more weeks <PERSON> Hashim </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Shepards </ORGANIZATION> are the only people allowed to attend the inquest daily, although the mother of another cadet went to the courthouse in the vain hope of watching the proceeding. `` I want to know that justice is done. I felt so helpless watching this go on,'' said the woman, who declined to give her name. <PERSON> Hashim </PERSON> has said the <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> family wants criminal charges filed against the cadet's trainers, State Troopers <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. They led six other troopers in directing training on the first day of the 14-week session.

 Israeli troops reportedly shot and ounded at least a dozen Palestinians today as stone-throwing demonstrations erupted in four towns or cities in the occupied territories. The violence broke out as some Palestinians went on strike in response to a call by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, a Moslem fundamentalist group at odds with the PLO-backed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising. To try to block anti-Israeli violence during the strike, the army imposed curfews on 14 refugee camps and villages in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as well as seven <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities and towns, confining 370,000 residents to their homes. The army also strengthened patrols and made preventive arrests to reduce the likelihood of clashes. Troops clashed with demonstrators in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION>, wounding three Palestinians, including a 33-year-old woman who was shot in the stomach and a 14-year-old boy who was hit in the chest, officials at the <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> hospital said. Nine Palestinians also were reported wounded by army gunfire in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the nearby villages of <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leid </LOCATION>. One of the wounded was a 10-year-old boy shot in the left leg, hospital officials said. At least 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed in the nearly year-long revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In the biblical town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> today, youths from rival <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> factions, some brandishing knives and clubs, shouted threats at each other today in a dispute over the strike called by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for zeal. The dispute stems from a Nov. 17 declaration by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The strike was to mark the anniversary of one of those resolutions, a 1947 recommendation that <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> be partitioned into Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> marched through the city forcing stores shut. Slogans scribbled in green paint on city walls warned merchants, `` Today is a strike day, be sure you observe it.'' Green is the traditional color of Islam. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, who ordered their own strike a day earlier, demanded shopkeepers open their stores in defiance of the fundamentalists. They kicked closed shop doors, shouting to owners that they would protect them from the Islamic extremists if the shops opened. The strike was widely observed in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersualem </LOCATION>. The city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> is a dominant Palestinian faction, was totally shuttered. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, stores were closed, but people could be seen going to work in offices on upper stories of buildings. One shopkeeper said stores were closed because youths from <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> threatened to stone those that opened. As reporters walked away, an elderly man told the shopkeeper, `` Do n't tell these things to outsiders.'' Palestinian officials have canceled Christmas celebrations in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was born, in solidarity with the Palestinian revolt. `` We do n't see any reason to celebrate Christmas,'' <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said Monday. `` We have to show concern for our dead and for our detainees.'' <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said the town government called off all official celebrations, such as the Christmas Eve reception for Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> dignitaries and the annual Boy Scout parade. Manger Square, usually decorated with bright strings of colored lights, will remain dark and its 40-foot Christmas tree will be left bare, he said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> today urged his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to consider joining a coalition government led by the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc in order to withstand demands for controversial religious legislation. On Monday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc asked the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to join a new coalition government, offering the rival party two of the four most powerful Cabinet posts. Labor leaders are meeting Wednesday to consider the offer.

 <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, self-described former secret police officer and cousin of Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, said today he fled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to join anti-government Moslem guerrillas. He denounced <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as `` a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> puppet'' and said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s mother once tried to escape from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, only to be captured, chained and struck by the president himself `` I witnessed myself that he started slapping his mother ... `` Since <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is not sincere to his own mother, how can he be sincere to the nation?'' asked <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Fahima </PERSON>, now was under virtual house arrest. The mustachioed 27-year-old said he used family connections and his status in <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION>, the Afghan version of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, to forge papers and bribe his way out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, who like former <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> does not use a family surname, spoke at a news conference organized by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>. The Pakistan-based group is one of seven factions fighting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s forces and their Soviet military backers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said he has been granted refugee status in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. However, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said his application, submitted about a month ago, still was pending. The escapee said he and his wife left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Oct. 28 and flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, where they were met by guerrilla representatives. `` My plan is to actively join the mujahedeen -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- ... I would like to go back to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and fight Russians,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>. He is the second close relative of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> to defect to the guerrillas in less than five months. Last summer <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Siddiqullah </PERSON> entered <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with the guerrillas and accused <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of arranging the murder of their father. <PERSON> Siddiqullah </PERSON> offered no proof. He later went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, who spoke in Pushtu through a guerrilla interpreter, said at least 10 of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s close relatives have sought refuge outside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said he was doubly related to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> through the intermarriages common in Islamic societies. `` My mother and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s mother are sisters, and my father and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s father are brothers,'' he said. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said his brother <PERSON> Noorullah </PERSON>, a deputy minister of tribal affairs, and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> forced him to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1987 for a six-month secret police training course. Afterwar he returned to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and soon became a brigadier in KHAD. `` You can become a general in a week,'' he smiled when asked about his meteoric rise. He said he never witnessed any of the tortures <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION> has been accused of by the guerrillas and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> residents. His KHAD assignment, said, was an undercover role reporting on <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Layeq </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s minister of tribal affairs and a longtime member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He echoed guerrilla assertions that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is doomed. `` The Kremlin leaders are trying to bring another person who could replace <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a non-party person. Now the Russians are trying to save their interests and go back,'' he said. Under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed last April, the Soviets have withdrawn half their 115,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and are supposed to withdraw the rest by Feb. 15.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister said today his country will `` work as much as we can'' to gain freedom for all foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including Iranians he maintains are held by a Christian militia. The hostage issue has dominated the state visit of German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who arrived Sunday. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has offered to act as a mediator in gaining the release of Western hostages, including nine Americans, believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, West German government sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> met for four hours Monday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and held separate discussions with President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> told reporters today that `` there are n't just American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but there also are Iranian hostages, who are in the hands of Christian militiamen.'' He was referring to three Iranians who disappeared with their Lebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped by Christian Phalangist gunmen. The four are widely believed to have died. No group claimed responsibility for their kidnapping. `` Western nations, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have close ties to -LRB- the Phalangists -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said. `` We want all hostages to be free, the Iranians as well, and we will work as much as we can so that they are freed.'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> did not specify what actions <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might take. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> was to meet again today with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, as well as Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. `` The issue of the hostages remains of the utmost concern to us,'' said a West German official in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We are ready to do whatever we can to speed their release.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s good contacts with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> throughout the Iran-Iraq war were seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostages who had been held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> stressed in his talks that freeing the hostages is a `` humanitarian question that is independent of nationalities'' and he `` urged the Iranians to continue their efforts toward ... -LRB- their -RRB- release,'' said the West German official. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Westerners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian, a Swiss and an Irishman.

 A hush-hush countdown continued today with the space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew facing an unfavorable weather forecast for Thursday's scheduled liftoff on a secret military mission. Air Force weather officials said there was a 70 percent probability the weather Thursday would violate launch criteria. Heavy clouds, winds up to 28 mph and possible rain showers were predicted. Capt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, reported these conditions would be unacceptable, and he said the outlook for Friday was about the same. The weather was high on the agenda as a 21-member team of managers and engineers met today to evaluate all aspects of launch preparations. The group was expected to issue a brief statement late in the day on the readiness of Atlantis and its military crew for a mission that reportedly will deploy the $ 500 million Lacrosse satellite to spy on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The decision-making team is headed by astronaut <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director for shuttle operations, who has sole authority to approve or stop a launch. The astronauts were up early today to make proficiency training flights in T-38 jet aircraft. They were scheduled later to review their operations plan, check flight equipment and undergo medical examinations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, remained silent on the exact status of the countdown after announcing that it had started early Monday. Officials will only say that the launch is set for sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. Thursday. Sources reported today that the count was on time and that at 8 a.m. it entered an eight-hour, built-in hold. The hold is contingency time in case the launch team has any catching up to do. Other sources have reported the liftoff will occur about 7 a.m. if weather and other conditions are favorable. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issue periodic reports that the countdown is progressing but want to keep its precise status secret to cloak the exact time of launch. There also will be a news blackout through the flight on what the astronauts are doing in orbit. Pentagon officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. But the Soviets, through its news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, have indicated they know much about the mission. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the main task of the flight is to release a new generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse, to `` conduct surveillance over the territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the help of updated radar.'' The agency also said the satellite will play the role of `` eye'' for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new B-2 stealth bomber. The Tass information is similar to that reported in recent weeks in this country. The Atlantis commander is <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the pilot is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, and the mission specialists are Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>'s team of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and contractor experts was assembled for the first time before September's launch of Discovery _ first shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster of January 1986. One reason it was established was a breakdown in communications that prevented cold weather concerns of some engineers from reaching those who made the decision to launch Challenger on its ill-fated mission. The cold was cited as contributing to the rocket failure that destroyed the shuttle and killed its crew of seven. The <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> team monitors the countdown closely and makes the go-ahead decisions for important milestones such as filling Atlantis' fuel tank, scheduled for Wednesday night.

 A former hostage in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner testified today the hijackers threatened to kill an American passenger every five minutes unless their demands for fuel were met. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Toga </PERSON>, a 30-year-old nurse who was seven months pregnant at the time of the incident, also said that at one point one of the hijackers held a gun to her head. Mrs. Toga testified at the trial of confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed in the ordeal and 39 Americans were hostage for 17 days. Mrs. Toga, who was returning from a three-week vacation with her husband <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> when the Athens-to-Rome flight was seized, said she was not mistreated by the hijackers, but heard other passengers being beaten. She said that during a stop in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, the hijackers said they would start killing Americans if the airplane was not refueled. `` <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> -LRB- the flight purser -RRB- told me that they were threatening to kill one American passenger every five minutes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said. The plane was refueled and flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. Mrs. Toga also said that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> at one point reassured her she was safe. `` I was crying, but <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told me that I had nothing to worry about. He said they were interested only in young American men, but they respected women and children,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits he was one of the hijackers, but denies shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said the other hijacker _ fugitive <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> _ threatened her with a gun just before she was freed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. `` I was chosen to leave the plane, and at that point I saw my husband. I wanted to stay with my husband, but the other hijacker put the gun to my head and told me to get out,'' she testified. Under guidelines set by the court, Mrs. Toga was not required to disclose her hometown. At the time of the hijacking she and her husband lived in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Before Mrs. Toga's testimony, prosecutors disclosed that they had had <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s cell searched during the weekend for secret communications the defendant may have received from acquaintances in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> said some documents were taken from the cell and photocopied, but he did not say what they were. Both <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and his defense attorneys charged the search was illegal and asked that <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> be dropped from the case. Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> made no ruling on the motion. The defense attorneys also asked that officials from American television networks be called to testify at the trial. The attorneys said they had asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for permission to examine tapes made during the hijacking but there had been no reply. They indicated they wanted the network officials to present the tapes in court. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in January 1987 after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

 Tornado-shocked victims tried to put their shattered lives and homes back in order today from a series of twisters that killed four people, including a couple found with their arms wrapped around each other. At least 17 tornadoes were reported early Monday, covering 200 miles of eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, injuring 151 people and causing more than $ 50 million in damage. One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cimerro </PERSON> landed on their mattress against a tree across the street. `` I held onto her as tight as I could, and the next thing I know, we are flying,'' said <PERSON> Cimerro </PERSON>. `` It was like a ride at the fair.'' Their home was destroyed but they were not seriously injured. A neighbor, 8-year-old <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, died when a chimney collapsed on her bed. Further north in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, 12-year-old <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON> died of head and chest injuries. In rural <LOCATION> Nash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> died with his arms wrapped around his fatally injured wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, apparently in an effort to shield her from the tornado that destroyed their mobile home, authorities said. They had been thrown from the mobile home. Their two children, ages 14 and 8, survived. Authorities had put the death toll at six, but later corrected it to four. The tornadoes struck in nine counties, from Wake in the center of the state, to Dare on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, authorities said. Most of the damage was in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, where tornadoes cut a 10-mile swath. City Manager <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the storm caused about $ 50 million in damage in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, the state capital. With about 85 percent of estimates completed, about 152 businesses and residential buildings were destroyed, 301 buildings received major damage and 644 buildings minor damage, he said. About 500 people were left homeless in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. Damage estimates from other counties were not compiled. The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a 250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> asked the federal <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to declare <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> a disaster area. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in Wake County got so many offers of assistance that the agency ended up turning away some would-be volunteers. Organizations rallied to supply everything from free legal advice to tips about home repairs. The twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches, toppled several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto houses and streets. A K mart store was flattened by the twister, and six <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> residents, including four juveniles, were charged Monday with looting the store. More than 6,500 homes were left without power, but by Monday night electricity had been restored to all but 1,100 customers of <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light, said spokesman <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said. By nightfall Monday, most of those whose homes were damaged had found somewhere to spend the night, either checking into hotels and motels or staying with friends and relatives, authorities said. Only 17 people from five families spent the night at a <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> middle school, the only shelter in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by the storm, said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON>, nurse coordinator for the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter. `` That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' she said. `` People in the city do n't think other people care much about them, but when something like this happens, we come together.'' Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12 tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber, and two hog operations were destroyed, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. There were also losses of livestock in Wake, <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> counties. `` If federal disaster status is appropriate, I'll press for it with all I've got,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did not begin issuing tornado warnings until 38 minutes after the first tornado touched down in western <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> because the twister was too close to radar to monitor, authorities say. `` If you are looking straight up at a storm you ca n't see much,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonski </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the weather service at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. In neighboring <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, one tornado and high wind downed trees, damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of <LOCATION> Wight </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported. At another scene of tornado damage, officials in <LOCATION> Ruleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, have decided there will be no classes for children there for at least a week and preparations will be made to move high school students to an empty building in a nearby town. A tornado cut a 60-foot-wide swath through <LOCATION> Ruleville </LOCATION> on Saturday, destroying six homes and damaging the Delta town's three public schools and other structures.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Begin Joint Development Of New Fighter Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> announced today they will jointly develop a new fighter plane in a project expected to cost more than $ 8 billion. Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> signed an agreement under which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will bear the costs of planning and producing the sophisticated plane. The fighter, named the FSX, is to be developed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese companies. Japanese officials have said the total cost of developing the plane and producing an initial order of 130 and an expected follow-up order _ both of which will go to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ will be more than $ 8.2 billion. Each FSX plane will cost the Japanese government $ 42.2 million, Japanese defense officials said. The two allied countries had clashed on the question of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the project _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> originally sought to develop the jet using only Japanese companies and technology, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials pressed for a joint project to trim <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two sides reportedly agreed in June to allocate between 35 and 45 percent of the project to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. But <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> said today that `` the details of the division of work between the two countries will be decided later, taking into consideration such factors as economic efficiency.'' The new fighter will be based on <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>' F-16, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> named <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> the prime contractor and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a subcontractor. Two other major Japanese firms, <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, also were designated as subcontractors. The Japanese technologies expected to be used in the plane include a sophisticated radar, advanced materials and a special wing to enhance maneuverability. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to develop a special engine with increased power. The plane will cost $ 1.35 billion to develop in eight years, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. It said mass production of the fighter plane is expected to begin in 1997. The new fighter will replace <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s F-1 planes _ the only fighter developed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since World War II _ and the F-4 fighter-interceptor planes. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has exempted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from its ban on the export of military technology on condition that usage of Japanese military technology would be limited to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense activities. After <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation forces closed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s aviation industry until 1952, when Japanese companies began servicing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft in the Korean War. Since then, the domestic industry has depended heavily on contracts from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, including development and production of F-15 fighters under license from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. Under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` no-war'' constitution written after World War II, its Self-Defense Forces are one of the world's most heavily funded military establishments and bans the introduction of nuclear arms into the country. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is spending $ 27.82 billion annually for defense, or slightly more than 1 percent of its projected gross national product. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains about 64,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under a mutual security treaty.

 `` Stay Tuned'' is the standard answer from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp these days when asked about the timing of the next appointments to administration jobs. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, spokeswoman for President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition office, most recently gave the response when reporters asked her when the new <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary might be named `` And do n't be too far from the phone,'' she added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who insists that only he knows when appointments will come, made a surprise announcement Monday, picking <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> to say on in the post. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> had already taken herself out of the running. Another woman dropped out of the race Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. `` I have indicated to my own staff that I plan to return to the private sector and find other ways to help,'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already had indicated that he would not keep any more incumbent Cabinet members in their jobs Already staying are Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. For over a week, reports have circulated that former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the front-runner for the Pentagon job. A source close to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office said a decision on Tower could come today or Wednesday. The source, who spoke on condition he not be named, said the president-elect likes Tower and thinks he would do a good job at the Pentagon. But some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers have raised objections, partly because they do not have a high regard for a number of people who have worked for Tower and might have an inside track for top Pentagon jobs should he be named. Another Texan, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, is supposed to have a lock on the job of commerce secretary. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, an oilman from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is a close friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s. Here is some other new speculation about key jobs: _ Two Missourians, Rep. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, the No. 2 person at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, have emerged as competitors for the top position at the department. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a hog and grain farmer, has been head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. _ Sources said Monday that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Helander </PERSON>, a former vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, was being mentioned as a possible successor to <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was an outspoken supporter of the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas. _ Sources also said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, the editor-at-large of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report and a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications chief, may be a candidate to be ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may also make a decision soon on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director.

<HEAD>Scandal Widens Amid New York City School Boards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investigations into drug use, sexual harassment and job-selling by members of the city's community school boards are widening, and debate is rising over who should control the districts. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> planned to go to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to lobby the Legislature today to allow a revamping of the current decentralized arrangement. <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said Monday that `` evidence exists to bring indictments'' of those accused of demanding money or sexual favors in return for jobs. He is investigating two of the boards. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said the schools' inspector general is investigating six district boards in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Green has suspended District 9's board pending results of <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s investigation into drug use by some members. At least two members of unidentified local school boards in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> have offered to cooperate with investigators, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. Green, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> planned to urge lawmakers to bar politicians from running for local boards and using them as bases for power and patronage. They also want to return to the chancellor more power over principals of elementary and intermediate schools. The school system was decentralized 18 years ago, putting control of the 800 schools for kindergarten through eighth or ninth grade in the hands of 32 locally elected district boards. The high schools remain under jurisdiction of the central board. Since school elections produced very small voter turnouts, many boards were in many cases taken over by the politically connected. The sex and money demands were the latest news to rock the school system, which is still grappling with the arrest of a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> principal on crack-buying charges and the accusation that some local school board members were regular cocaine users. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said board members in several districts have been accused of demanding sex for jobs or promotions. In an affidavit, a school aide has charged that a former president of a school board in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> blocked her promotion to a paraprofessional job after she refused alleged repeated sexual advances. The official, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, dismissed <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Picart </PERSON>'s charges as `` a woman's revenge.'' He said in today's Daily News that she was upset over not being chosen for the paraprofessional job. The News also quoted unidentified sources as saying investigators are looking into allegations that some board members may have used school aides and district office workers as personal chauffeurs and handymen. In a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district, a principal allegedly had to dip into his pension to pay a board member so he could receive tenure, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday reported. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said his hotline had gotten 50 or 60 calls about wrongdoing in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and that he was passing along information to the appropriate prosecutors.

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> violated the human rights of four men held under anti-terrorism laws in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. It said <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dermot </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> are entitled to compensation because they were denied speedy judicial hearings after their arrests in late 1984. Through <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON>, the men said they would seek substantial damages and return to the European court if there were no amicable settlement. The four were detained for up to six days and 16 hours and released without charge. The court upheld <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s right to arrest suspected terrorists without charging them with a specific offense. But it said detainees must be granted a prompt hearing before a judge. The men were arrested as part of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s campaign against the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> that seeks to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> through a campaign of terrorist violence. Roman Catholic nationalists in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> welcomed the decision, but legislators said the court failed to understand <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s battle against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The British government said it was studying the decision and would respond in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at an unspecified date. `` We have to consider the human rights of the victims and potential victims of terrorism as well as those suspected of terrorist involvement,'' said a statement from the Home Office, which is responsible for law and order. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Once again the British have been found guilty of abusing human rights in the North.'' <PERSON> Merlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker and former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister responsible for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, criticized the ruling. But he said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will have to accept it `` because part of our problem is convincing the world that we are not a repressive colonial government in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a legislator from the governing Conservative party, said the judgment shows `` no understanding of the terrorist threat to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the government should reject it out of hand.'' Under <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s anti-terrorism law persons simply suspected of terrorist activities can be arrested. But the European court found none of the men `` was either brought ` promptly' before a judicial authority or released ` promptly' following his arrest. The court did not define promptness except to say the human rights convention allows `` only a limited degree of flexibility'' to extend the duration of detention. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prevention of Terrorism Act permits suspected terrorists to be detained for 48 hours, although the government can extend that for another five days. According to latest figures available at the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Office, 411 were arrested between January and March this year, of whom 121 were held beyond 48 hours. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> is part of the 21-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the oldest organization working toward more European integration. The court's rulings are not legally binding but rarely are ignored.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Soviet parliament today it would gain the right to veto his decisions if it adopts his revised proposals to overhaul the Soviet political system. In a speech opening a three-day special session of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership made the veto proposal among 88 changes it recommended in response to 250,000 public comments on the new election law and constitutional amendments put before the body today. Two high republic officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, however, registered dissatisfaction with elements of the reform program when addressing the plenum, signalling the start of a genuine debate in the chamber where ritual ascent is the norm. The original drafts, published just five weeks ago, sparked widespread criticism that the changes would concentrate too much power in the presidency in a nation with a history of dictatorship. In a reference to the outcry, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged, `` It is obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not formulated precisely enough and caused quite a few critical remarks in the course of the discussions.'' Reading today from a new draft, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Supreme Soviet `` has the right to veto decrees of the presidium, instructions of the president of the Supreme Soviet,'' and the leadership would be required to account to the legislature `` at least once a year.'' Currently, directives from the president are made in the name of the Presidium and are subject to confirmation at the next full session of the Supreme Soviet. But practically, there are no challenges. The Supreme Soviet had its first non-unanimous vote in memory last month. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised that other changes also would preserve the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s traditional collective style of leadership. Under that style, the highest government body _ the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet _ and the highest party body _ the Politburo _ are collective bodies. The head of the Presidium is the president, traditionally a ceremonial role. It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was giving up his original proposal to strengthen the president's role by giving him chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and responsibility for overseeing foreign policy. The latest draft of the proposed changes also responded to complaints from small republics, including <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, by increasing the republics' representation in one of the houses of the bicameral parliament. <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> asked that the reform package be postponed to consider objections by his parliament, including one to the possibility of an individual occupying several seats in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. Another Baltic president, <PERSON> Vitautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Astrauskas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, called for a convention to write a new constitution that would give the central government authority to decide issues of national scope and reserve all other matters for the republics. But he welcomed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announced changes and accepted the president's proposal to put off issues of the rights of republics until later. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed creating a special commission to settle the question of division of power between the 15 Soviet republics and the central government and suggested the deputies limit this session to overhauling the government structure. He said the complex questions of the rights of the republics and the powers of local legislative bodies, known as soviets, or councils, could be left for later. `` We have just embarked on reform,'' he said. `` In this revolutionary period, we are blowing up the old structure.'' The first step in reconstruction is the overhaul now before the parliament, he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected complaints that the principle of one man, one vote is violated by a plan to let organizations, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and trade unions, elect one-third of the deputies in a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. He said the reform clearly states that legislative elections can have multiple candidates, but added that because numerous candidates could be proposed, they must face `` preliminary discussion'' before their local nominating commissions. It was not known whether the commissions could reject specific candidates. The Soviet leader also hinted at promised future reforms. They include a rewrite of the preamble of the Soviet constitution, including the `` definition of socialist property.'' The 1,500-member legislative body met in special session one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the changes, a move that in the past would have paved the way for unanimous approval by the parliament.

 A `` good Samaritan'' who shot two muggers asked for leniency on a 1987 drug conviction, but a judge who imposed a stiff sentence said he did not want to send a message to the public that it is `` OK to go and kill people.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavin </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON> to 1 -LCB- to 4 -LCB- years in prison, only slightly less than the maximum two - to six-year sentence he could have received `` If he's such a fine person, why did he have a Brazilian-made Saturday night special?'' <PERSON> Slavin </PERSON> said at the sentencing Monday. `` You said you want to be an honest citizen; well, you can be an honest citizen when you get out of jail.'' <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> five years ago, had pleaded guilty in February 1987 to felony charges for directing two undercover police officers to a drug dealer who sold them two vials of crack. A fugitive since March 1987 who had been living under an assumed name, <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON>'s identity was revealed Nov. 2 when he came to the rescue of a woman being robbed on the street outside his home. He killed one man and wounded another, using an unregistered handgun. `` I knew that getting involved could lead to my exposure,'' <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON> said at his sentencing. `` I did not want to get involved, but I knew I had to do something to help.'' <PERSON> Slavin </PERSON> last year had promised <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON> a sentence of one day in jail and five years probation on the drug conviction, but had warned him if he did not appear for sentencing he would impose a two - to six-year prison term <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON>, who read from a written statement, told the judge Monday that the reason he did not come to his sentencing was that an immigration lawyer had told him that he could be deported to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. `` I was afraid. I did not want to go back to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> because I love <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I know it is the land of opportunity,'' <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON> said. He said that after he became a fugitive he made a vow to himself to be a law-abiding citizen and had worked as many as three jobs at a time to support a wife and two children in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Slavin </PERSON> said he reduced the sentence `` for his _ quote _ ` heroism.''' But the judge chided <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON> for going underground and changing his name and for owning the unlicensed gun which he used to shoot the two muggers. <PERSON> Fearon </PERSON> must serve the minimum of 1 -LCB- years before being eligible for parole. The mugging victim, <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, was not in court on Monday but had sent <PERSON> Slavin </PERSON> a letter urging him to be lenient.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> court erroneously upheld the rape, robbery and assault convictions of a man whose court-appointed lawyer withdrew from the case. In an 8-1 decision, the high court said the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> should not have decided on <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s appeal of rape, robbery and assault convictions without first appointing a new attorney to handle the case. `` The need for forceful advocacy does not come to an abrupt halt as the legal proceeding moves from the trial to appellate stage,'' Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote for the court, which ordered further hearings on the case. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> tribunal `` erred by failing to appoint new counsel to represent petitioner'' after determining that <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s case raised several possible legal issues for appellate review <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s original court-appointed lawyer was allowed to withdraw from the appeal after filing a statement that he found no legal errors by the trial judge that required reversal of the convictions. The appeals court then denied <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s request for a new lawyer but later reviewed the trial record and found that the defendant had `` several arguable claims.'' The court reversed one of the three convictions stemming from <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s involvement with two other men in the Aug. 4, 1984, break-in of a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home. But it ultimately concluded that <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> `` suffered no prejudice'' from his court-appointed lawyer's `` failure to give a more conscientious examination of the record'' and upheld the remaining two convictions. <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>, who is serving an 18-to-28-year sentence, was one of three men convicted of breaking into the home and sexually assaulting a man and two women, who were also robbed. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> court violated standards set by the high court in a 1967 opinion for judging the effectiveness of court-appointed lawyers handling appeals. `` Both stages of the prosecution, although perhaps involving unique legal skills, require careful advocacy to ensure that rights are not foregone and that substantial legal and factual arguments are not inadvertently passed over,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote in an opinion that drew a dissent from Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. `` It bears emphasis that the right to be represented by counsel is among the most fundamental rights,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote. `` We have long recognized that ` lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries','' the court's majority said, quoting from its landmark 1963 decision in <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> that mandated court-appointed lawyers for indigent defendants. But <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> called the decision `` a futile monument to the court's effort to guarantee to the indigent appellant what no court can guarantee him: exactly the same sort of legal services that would be provided suitably by retained private counsel.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> court's review of the trial record without assistance of <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s lawyer resulted in the proper finding that the defendant's rights were not prejudiced. But the court's majority rejected this view, saying that the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> tribunal could not justify its refusal to appoint a new lawyer on the ground there was no merit to <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s appeal. `` Finding harmless error or a lack of ... prejudice in cases such as this, however, would leave criminal appealants without any protections'' under the 1967 decision, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote. The case is <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> v. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 87-6116.

 A man on trial for murder in the beating of his illegally adopted daughter once whacked the sleeping 6-year-old in the face `` out of the clear blue sky,'' a witness testified. The witness, alleged drug dealer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON>, on Monday became the first person to testify that he actually saw <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a now-disbarred lawyer, strike <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> hit the girl hard enough `` to bring tears'' and for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> faces a $ 3 million lawsuit filed by his former live-in lover, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. The suit, filed in state court Monday, alleges <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> assaulted and tortured her for most of the 11 years they lived together. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> also charged that he used humiliation, brainwashing, drugs and the withholding of food to teach her that `` she was a worthless person who could only be saved through his wisdom and special powers.'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is expected to testify against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the murder trial. <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON>, who has been indicted on narcotics charges, had hired <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to represent him. <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said he saw <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> strike <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> on Oct. 23, 1987, as <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> drove them to <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Katrine </LOCATION> in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. More than 20 witnesses have testified against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> so far, but <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> is the first to report having seen <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> strike the girl. `` Right after she fell asleep,'' <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said, `` right out of the clear blue sky, Mr. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> took his hand and went ... -LRB- demonstrating the blow -RRB- SMASH!'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> struck the word `` smash'' from the record at the request of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyer, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Demonstrating the blow, <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> slammed the back of his hand against the judge's bench. The judge, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and the jurors seemed startled. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> smiled and shook his head as if in disbelief at Scannapieco's dramatic gesture. <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said the slap on the right side of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s face `` was pretty forceful, enough to bring tears to your eyes.'' She woke up and looked at <LOCATION> Steinberg </LOCATION>, who told her to `` stop staring at him and keep blinking and smiling. Keep blinking and smiling _ that's what she was told to do,'' <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> this five or six times. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> did not seem angry, <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scannapieco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told him he hit the child because she sometimes slowed her heart and breathing, putting herself into a near coma. He quoted <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as saying it was a medical condition that `` got so serious one time that he had to put her in the hospital.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was removed unconscious from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, and died of head injuries three days later. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has denied hitting the child. He has said she fell unconscious after choking on food and that he caused bruises on her chest and back while trying to revive her. A report in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> quoted court sources as saying that in the month before <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> free-based cocaine nightly from a kilogram that had been left with him for safekeeping by a client.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that police do not violate the rights of criminal defendants when, through negligence, they fail to preserve vital evidence or to conduct state-of-the-art laboratory tests. The justices, voting 6-3, reinstated the conviction of an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> man in the kidnaping and sodomizing of a 10-year-old boy. A lower court had thrown out the conviction and 10-year prison sentence of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> because police failed to preserve properly semen samples from the child's body and clothing. But today Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in his opinion for the high court, said, `` The situation here is no different than a prosecution for drunk driving that rests on police observation alone.'' `` The defendant is free to argue ... that a Breathalyzer test might have been exculpatory,'' he said. `` But the police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said that as long as the failure to conduct the tests was a result of police negligence, and not bad faith, the rights of the defendant are not violated. `` Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. In another decision, the justices ruled that an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> court erroneously upheld the rape, robbery and assault convictions of a man whose court-appointed lawyer withdrew from the case. Voting 8-1, the high court said the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> should not have decided on <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s appeal of rape, robbery and assault convictions without first appointing a new attorney to handle the case. In the evidence case, <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> was convicted of kidnaping his victim on Oct. 29, 1983, from a carnival in the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> area. Police said the boy was driven to a house, raped four times during a 90-minute ordeal and then released. The boy identified <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> as his attacker from photographs shown to him by police. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> was convicted of child molesting, sexual assault and kidnaping. Laboratory specialists found traces of semen on the boy and also in clothing he was wearing. It was not until a year later that the semen was tested to determine blood typing of the assailant. But no blood group substances were found. The semen sample taken from the boy's body was refrigerated. The clothing, which might have contained a larger quantity of semen, was not. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> was determined to be what is known as a secretor, with blood type A. That means that his blood group could be determined from his semen. The absence of blood group substances in the semen taken from the victim suggested that the boy's attacker either was a non-secretor or that the samples were too small to determine blood type. There also was testimony that technologically advanced tests to determine blood grouping were not performed on the semen samples. An <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> appeals court threw out <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>'s conviction on grounds that had state-of-the-art tests been performed and had the best technology been used to preserve the evidence, <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> might have been found innocent. Dissenting today were Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, writing for all three, said, `` An understanding of due process demonstrates that the evidence which was allowed to deteriorate was ` constitutionally material', and that its absence significantly prejudiced'' <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>. The case is <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, 86-1904.

 The recent murders of three drifters in <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> have been linked to a single killer, and police are urging male transients and homosexuals to avoid the park at night. `` We are worried that there is someone out there who may kill again,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Olias </PERSON> said Monday. `` We know that two of the three victims were transients and at least two were homosexual,'' he said. The type of gun used is the common link among the slayings, said police spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who declined to elaborate. Each victim died of multiple gunshot wounds in the separate shootings over the past two weeks. `` Single men by themselves in the park after dark should use extreme care,'' Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. `` There is someone out there who has already killed three of them.'' Police assigned extra patrol units to the park Monday night to increase surveillance and warn park users of the danger. Up to several hundred drifters are estimated to seek shelter at night in the sprawling park, which is less than one mile north of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` It fluctuates,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` No one has been able to conduct a tally, but it's been as high as in the hundreds because many hide in the canyons.'' Homicide detectives refused to discuss evidence related to the killings, saying through <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> only that their investigation has `` conclusively linked three recent homicides in <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.'' `` Right now, they're playing it pretty close to the vest because it is a new series that we've just been able to put together,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The series began with the Nov. 19 discovery of the body of transient <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Siino </PERSON>, 31. <PERSON> Olias </PERSON> said he was staying at a downtown hotel and had been in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area for the past eight months. The body of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, 60, was found Friday. Hope, who had been dead for three to five days, is believed to have arrived from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> days before his death, <PERSON> Olias </PERSON> said. The most recent victim was identified as <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, 36, a transient from <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, whose body was found Saturday in a park bathroom. He apparently had been living out of his car, which was parked nearby, <PERSON> Olias </PERSON> said. None of the victims apparently had local jobs or knew either of the others, said <PERSON> Olias </PERSON>, who emphasized that it is n't known whether the killer is targeting gay men, transients or both. The restroom where <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> was killed has a longstanding reputation as a meeting place for homosexuals, said <PERSON> Olais </PERSON>, who noted it's also in an area of the park where a sharp rise in assaults and burglaries last month prompted police to temporarily increase patrols. Police blamed most of the earlier crime wave on a band of illegal aliens, but Lt. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said he does n't think the recent killings are related. `` Based on what we know, we do n't think we have seen the same person,'' <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence -LRB- in the recent shootings -RRB- of robbery.''

 A 3-year-old girl who has spent most of her life in the hospital underwent a rare, five-organ transplant today that doctors said was her only chance for survival. Rolandrea Dodge of <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, went into surgery around 11 p.m. Monday. The complicated operation was expected to end early in the afternoon at the earliest, said spokesmen at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The surgical team, headed by Dr. <PERSON> Satoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Todo </PERSON>, was implanting a new liver, pancreas, part of a stomach and small and large intestines into the child. The organs were procured by transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> from a single donor, a child whose identity was withheld. `` The surgery is going very smoothly,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON>, who is usually known as <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON>, arrived at Children's Hospital in mid-October to be evaluated for a multiple organ transplant She was accompanied by her parents, <PERSON> Branden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, who also have two sons. Roll was born with the incurable disease intractable secretory diarrhea, which prevented her intestines from absorbing food and liquids. She had to be fed intravenously, although she was allowed occasional nibbles of candy, potatoes and other solid food. Aside from brief outings, <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON> has spent her entire life in hospitals. Doctors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said she would n't survive long unless she underwent a multiple organ transplant. The girl's liver began failing about three months ago, and her skin became jaundiced, or yellow in color because of bile pigments in the blood. Doctors began administering an experimental drug on Nov. 9 in hopes of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids, but it was unsuccessful, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. `` That was really the last available treatment option,'' she said. Dodge, 27, a surface coal miner, said shortly after arriving in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> that it was difficult deciding whether to allow <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON> to undergo the experimental transplant. But, he said, `` It's the only hope that we've got left.'' `` We do n't have any doubts,'' he said. `` It's just the way our -LRB- American -RRB- <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> people are. That's just the way they taught us: Try not to think negative about things, it's going to work out.'' The Dodges are Navajo and have received pledges of support from the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Abdominal transplants involving two or more organs previously have been performed only four times in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and all the patients have died The longest survivor, <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 3 -LCB-, of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, died of a bloodstream infection in May, six months after receiving a record five organs at Children's Hospital.

He was released from prison 10 days before Monday's shootings. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boles </PERSON>, 41, a four-year veteran with a wife and two children, died at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> shortly after the shooting north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strzalkowski </PERSON>, 34, a six-year veteran with a pregnant wife and young son, also was killed. Each was shot at least three times with one of their service revolvers, said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Street apparently grabbed the gun after he attacked the officers with a piece of pipe, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. They were wearing bullet-proof vests when they were shot, authorities said. `` Both of the officers had head wounds, very serious head wounds,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, `` as well as -LRB- wounds -RRB- to the arms and shoulders and about the tops of their bodies.'' The killings occured less than hour after Street had called for an ambulance at a gas station because he was feeling ill. But Street left the ambulance and set out on foot after deciding not to go to the hospital. Both officers were called after residents at a trailer park complained of a screaming man throwing stones and a broken car tailpipe at mobile homes and passing cars. A man who said he saw the killings from about 15 feet away reported seeing a tall man grapple first with one, then with both officers. `` They tried to take him, but they were not strong enough to keep him in their arms,'' said the witness, who refused to give his name. `` He was stronger and bigger than they were.'' The witness, who said he was a 66-year-old retired businessman from western <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, said the man then shot both officers, stole one of their patrol cars and drove off. The suspect drove away one of the slain officer's cruisers, with lights still flashing, to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where he ditched the car and commandeered another car from a woman stopped at an intersection, police said. Police arrested Street a short time later after he abandoned that car and set out on foot. Earlier convictions against Street included two assaults on police officers, battery, resisting arrest with violence, aggravated assault on an officer and grand larceny, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMaster </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Street was most recently released after serving a little more than half of his 15-year attempted-murder sentence despite numerous disciplinary reports written by corrections officers stemming from fights with inmates, <PERSON> MacMaster </PERSON> said.

 A cocaine overdose killed a young princess whose husband, a great-grandson of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s last emperor, subsequently killed himself in shock and grief, police said today. <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, 26, was found dead Monday by her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON>, in the bedroom of their villa at <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, a lakeside resort in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Salzkammergut </LOCATION> lake district. Police sources in <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Linz </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> province, said today a preliminary autopsy showed the Austrian-born princess died of heart and lung edema after consuming cocaine. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> security police who asked not to be identified said syringes and a small amount of `` powder'' were found near the body of the princess. The <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a source in the public prosecutor's office, said the powder was cocaine. The public prosecutor's office at <LOCATION> Wels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, said investigators found punctures on the arms of the dead prince and princess, suggesting both used narcotics. The result of an official post-mortem was expected later this week. Police said the case also is under court investigation. The 33-year-old prince, a relative of the British, <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> royal families, was found shot to death near a lake at <LOCATION> Almtal </LOCATION>, a wooded area some 20 miles from <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, police said. His hunting rifle was beside him, police said. The couple is survived by their infant son, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, who slept next door to the bedroom where his mother was found dead, Austrian newspapers said. Police said the prince and his wife dined Sunday night with members of a West German pop group. The princess retired early and was found dead by her husband at 2:45 a.m. The prince called the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and told them his wife had `` probably taken cocaine,'' a police spokesman said. Prince <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON>, the second of three sons of Prince Ernst August of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, was the grandson of Emperor <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Viktoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Luise </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brunswick-Luneburg </LOCATION>. The couple was part of the European jet set, moving in the world of rock music and fashion. The prince spent many years in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and the princess attended a fashionable school in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bernard-Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, the `` enfant terrible'' of French intellectuals, won the prestigious Interallie literary prize today for his account of the decadent life of Romantic poet <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Baudelaire </PERSON>. `` The Last Days of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Baudelaire </PERSON>,'' a best-seller, is a fictionalized biography of the 19th century author known for the sensory imagery of his `` Flowers of Evil,'' a poetry collection condemned in its time for obscenity. In his book, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> created dialogue spoken by <PERSON> Baudelaire </PERSON>, his mixed-race lover, his mother and his publisher to recount the agonizing last years of a religious mystic who frequented <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> prostitutes and died of syphilis. The 39-year-old <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, known as a `` new philosopher,'' catapulted to intellectual stardom in 1977 when he attacked Marxism, claiming it inevitably led to totalitarianism. Last year, in `` L'Eloge des Intellectuals,'' -LRB- In Praise of Intellectuals -RRB-, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> lambasted French intellectuals for remaining silent on important social and political issues. In 1981, he provoked debate with `` L'Ideologie Francaise,'' -LRB- French Ideology -RRB- an essay denouncing the French mentality that produced a World War II government that collaborated with the Nazi occupation. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s best-selling `` <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diable </ORGANIZATION> en Tete'' -LRB- The Devil Ahead -RRB-, a 20th century epic, was published in 1984. Brilliant, handsome and not one to mince words, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> once described himself as `` the best writer and the most talented essayist of my generation.'' The winner of the Interallie prize, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Cercle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interallie </ORGANIZATION>, is awarded $ 765. This year's Chateaubriand prize was awarded today to <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Revel </PERSON>, 64, a conservative political pundit, for his life's work. Revel, who is known for his writings about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society and politics, recently wrote `` La Connaissance Inutile,'' -LRB- Useless Knowledge -RRB-. The book is a bitter attack on the news media for its tendency to spread disinformation. `` The enemy is no longer ignorance, but lies,'' Revel wrote. The Chateaubriand prize, whose winner receives $ 8,500, is sponsored by the Comite du <ORGANIZATION> Rayonnement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francais </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that promotes <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> culture. Although the Chateaubriand has a bigger purse, the Interallie is considered more prestigious and therefore a greater spur to book sales.

<HEAD>Circuit Breaker Inspections Ordered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ordered the nation's 110 nuclear plants to locate and test possibly counterfeit and faulty circuit breakers installed in safety systems, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed today. Spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said a Nov. 22 bulletin issued by the commission found that recent inspections `` indicate a potential safety concern regarding electrical equipment supplied to nuclear power plants.'' However, a counterfeit or faulty breaker has never been blamed for any kind of incident at a nuclear plant, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. The order for inspections, which must be carried out by March 1, followed an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigation that found four <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies had allegedly sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> reported in July that it had found 30 counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> nuclear plant near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> found in the same month that it had bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Onofre </LOCATION> plant, 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary `` to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can be operated without undue risk to the public health and safety.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has found `` numerous failures'' of certain types of circuit breakers during preliminary commission-supervised tests, the bulletin said. If a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed _ and it can not be immediately tested _ the utility must submit `` an analysis justifying continued operation,'' the bulletin said. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the inspection plan was criticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuit breakers. `` The test program is not adequate to provide assurance that the tested ... circuit breakers would be suitable for their intended purpose,'' the laboratory said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> responded by saying that it `` considers the test program to provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements and characteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has told utilities that more than 50 companies may be counterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components. <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davin </PERSON> said the utility was still evaluating the order and how it would affect the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Onofre </LOCATION> plant had not yet received the order, but that the utility would comply.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today found a Japanese man linked to a terrorist group guilty of transporting bombs on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION> after the man agreed to the government's description of the incident. In a surprise announcement Monday, defense attorneys <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said they would accept the government's claims about <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, who has been linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, on the condition that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> can maintain his right to appeal pre-trial rulings in the case Federal prosecutors said today in court they would accept the condition. Although <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> admitted to the government's account of his actions, if the pre-trial rulings, which bear on the admissibility of evidence against him, are overturned, his conviction could be thrown out. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> asked Kikumura a series of questions to make sure he understood what he was doing in a procedure similar to that used in guilty pleas. In essence, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> agreed to the charges and waived his right to a jury trial. `` There is no contest and there is no alternative,'' <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> said. `` I find the defendant <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> guilty of each count of the indictment.'' Outside the courthouse, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> had come to this country `` to kill people.'' `` This man is an international terrorist who sneakd into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using a skillfully forged passpport,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. If he had not been stopped, `` there would have been some people killed and maimed,'' he said. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> later told reporters that the government had wanted to create a `` show trial,'' and that the case was indefensible. But because evidence was illegally seized, he predicted, the conviction would be overturned. `` If you take away the constitutional rights of <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, you can take away the rights of anybody,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, another defense attorney. The defense proposed its deal Monday before jury selection began and moments after it lost an argument to have the indictment dismissed. Last month, <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> denied a motion to disqualify evidence _ namely, the three homemade bombs made of fire extinguisher canisters, explosives paraphernalia and numerous personal items found in Kikumura's car when he was arrested at a rest stop April 12 in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION>, less than five miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> to dismiss the indictment after prosecutors disclosed that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s phone calls with defense attorneys were recorded at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. All inmates' calls at the institution are recorded as a matter of course, although attorney-client calls are not supposed to be listened to. Previously, prosecutors had said the lawyer calls were not recorded. <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> found that the defense had not shown that any evidence was tainted or that the government benefited from the taping. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said his client would `` stipulate'' to the charges in the indictment _ an acknowledgement but not a formal guilty plea _ as long as <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> could be allowed to appeal <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON>'s ruling that the evidence was legally seized and other issues. `` We want to save the court's time, we want to save the taxpayers' money,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said, adding that if the government insisted on bringing the case before a jury, it would `` cause essentially a show trial where we will be mute.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> angrily objected to <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>'s raising plea negotiations in public, calling it `` unprecedented. <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> told both sides to discuss the matter, and report back today. He also told the 130 potential jurors to return today. Federal authorities have said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 36, may be linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a terrorist organization. Court documents showed he had traveled about 7,000 miles throughout the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> after arriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fie weeks before his arrest. In testimony Monday, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents said more than 25 agents in cities nationwide were involved in the investigation. People from four countries were on the government's witness list, said defense co-counsel <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said there were three main issues to present to an appellate court: contentions that the stop and search of <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s car was illegal and hence the evidence inadmissible; that the charges are repetitive because they carry 90 years in prison terms; and that the government may have had access to privileged attorney-client conversations through the corrections center phone recordings.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, held back by the summer drought, expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the performance of the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed in the third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent during the first six months of the year. It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, when the economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate. The report, however, represents an upward revision from a preliminary estimate last month, which pegged growth at 2.2 percent. The department attributed the revision to a higher-than-expected rise in personal consumption expenditures, which account for nearly two-thirds of economic activity. They rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the third quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 3.5 percent. Also, non-farm business inventories grew faster than originally thought. However, this could be a source of weakness in the future if consumer demand slackens and manufacturers have to cut production as the inventories are sold off. A price index tied to the GNP also proved more brisk than was first estimated. The index, which reflects changing consumption patterns as well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, up from the first estimate of 4.4 percent. The second quarter soared at an even faster 5.5 percent, the highest in nearly six years. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the latest report does not change `` the basic economic picture'' of moderate growth and steady inflation. `` Inflation remains at about the second quarter rate. And, after adjusting for the effects of the drought, the economy continues to grow at its long-term average pace, which is 2 to 3 percent,'' he said. However, the revisions to the GNP were about in line with economists' expectations and fit in with anticipation in the market that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will soon move to curb inflation by dampening growth with higher interest rates. Major banks on Monday raised their prime lending rate to 10.5 percent, the highest level since mid-1985. Economists expect a new round of increases as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tries to restrain growth to a non-inflationary pace of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pushed up interest rates steadily from late March through early August. For a time, it appeared the medicine was taking hold. A number of statistical reports showed slower growth in August and September. Government numbers released over the last three weeks, however, portray robust growth in October, the first month of the fourth quarter. `` It's amazing how strong the momentum is now,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` ... We'll be starting the seventh year of an economic expansion and the normal peacetime expansion lasts only three years.'' He predicts growth will accelerate to an annual rate of about 3.5 percent in the final three months of 1988, even with the aftershocks from the drought. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that without the drought third quarter growth would have been a strong 3.2 percent and second quarter growth would have been a brisk 3.9 percent, rather than 3.0 percent. The effect of the drought in the fourth quarter is estimated to be about double the drag in the third quarter. The two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year _ exports and business investment _ played less of role in the third quarter. Exports and imports both grew at an annual rate of 11.6 percent. Because imports were growing from a larger base, however, the nation's inflation-adjusted trade deficit as measured by the GNP worsened slightly for the first time in a year. Business investment grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 15.0 percent in the second quarter. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that exports and investment spending will rebound, in part because of the continued fall of the dollar, which hit a 40-year low last week against the Japanese yen. A lower dollar makes American goods cheaper on overseas markets, spurring export sales. The higher sales, in turn, stimulate spending by manufacturers to increase productive capacity. However, stronger growth brings with it the danger of higher prices as the economy strains to meet demand. Already, factories are using more of their production capacity _ 84 percent _ than at any time in more than eight years. With unemployment at a 14-year low of 5.3 percent, businesses are offering higher wages to attract workers. `` It's likely the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will respond by pushing up interest rates and tightening credit. ... Banks are already anticipating this process by raising their prime rate,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Higher interest rates discourage spending by both consumers and businesses, thus slowing economic expansion. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to do is engineer a moderation of growth to a somewhat less inflationary pace. It's a very delicate balancing act. The tightening so far just was n't enough to do the job,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual rate of $ 4.01 trillion. In an accompanying report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax corporate profits rose a slight 0.2 percent in the third quarter after soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. The July-September gain was the lowest since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987.

 The husband of a woman accused of snatching an infant from a hospital nursery thought his wife had just given birth and was unaware that she had faked her pregnancy, police and prosecutors say. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>, 36, was arraigned Monday on kidnapping charges in the abduction of 2 -LCB- - month-old <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who was taken from a crib at C.S <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> <PERSON> Children </PERSON>'s Hospital on Friday. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 300,000 and a hearing was set for Dec. 7. But authorities dropped charges against her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. `` We're fairly well convinced he did not know his wife planned to kidnap the baby,'' said Police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> was released after he passed a polygraph test Monday. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> -RRB- was telling him she was pregnant all along, that she has small babies and that she has them quick,'' <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> said. `` She really built this up in his mind.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> allegedly made medical appointments at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and told her husband she was visiting an obstetrician, <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> said he would stand by his wife. `` I do n't think she knew what she was doing,'' he said. `` I thought it was my child.'' The Newkirks, of <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, were arrested Saturday when they pulled into the driveway of their home in <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. Police said they found the baby in their car. Witnesses said the Newkirks showed off the child at <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>'s Pub in <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> about an hour after the 4 -LCB- - pound child was reported missing <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> was receiving medication at the hospital for breathing problems when she was taken. The premature infant also was hooked up to electronic monitoring equipment and required feeding every three hours to prevent dehydration. Her twin brother was left undisturbed in his nearby crib. The baby's 17-year-old mother, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, was n't at the hospital when her child was taken. The infant was returned to C.S. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> on Saturday, and was listed in good condition Monday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> today withdrew its recommendation of leniency for a man who killed a man nearly 20 years ago and later escaped from prison to build a new life in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The withdrawal came three weeks after <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on sexual abuse charges based on allegations made by a stepdaughter and a niece. During 17 years as a fugitive from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> raised a family and operated an auto repair shop in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> finally tracked him down last February, and he was returned to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. After a pardon board hearing in which <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON>' attorney presented petitions signed by 2,000 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> residents asking for leniency, the five members recommended a six-month sentence. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> refused to accept the recommendation, asking the board to reconsider. Before the pardon board could reconsider, <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` Based on the current situation in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the indictments being of such serious nature, the board recommended that any form of leniency be withdrawn,'' <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Viator </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said today. `` If he's found innocent, then he could apply here again for leniency.

 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra case today refused to bar prosecutors from closed hearings set to begin this week on deleting sensitive government secrets from documents to be used as evidence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> refused to give lawyers for the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide permission to file a motion to bar independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from the hearing, which is set to begin Wednesday. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in a brief order that barring prosecutors `` would alter the purpose of the hearing and would result in further and wholly unnecessary delay.'' Defense lawyers gave no reason for their request, filed Monday. If they had been granted permission to file the motion, they would likely have argued that prosecutors would get an unfair preview of their strategy if allowed to attend the hearing. North is charged with conspiring to divert millions of dollars in profits from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret weapons deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. The hearings were scheduled by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to consider defense objections to the deletion of sensitive material from classified documents that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to use as evidence against North. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has directed North to come to the hearing prepared to say why the material is relevant to his defense and should not be deleted. The references <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to delete include names of foreign countries and officials as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents operating abroad. The government has consented to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s use of the 350 documents as exhibits in a public trial provided the sensitive references are deleted. Also on Monday, <PERSON> North </PERSON> replied to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> bar the defense from using any of 40,000 pages of classified documents it has proposed as trial exhibits. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> North </PERSON> listed many of the documents in his Nov. 14 notice simply to provoke dismissal of the charges against him, by threatening to disclose some of the nation's best-kept secrets. North's lawyers countered that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is making a `` frontal assault on defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fundamental Fifth and Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.'' No date has been set for North's trial, the first of four ordered by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> for the former presidential aide and his three co-defendants: former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj.

 Rushed production schedules pressured workers inspecting parts for the B-1 bomber and some flawed parts may have been used in building the aircraft, some <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> plant workers say. A copyright report Monday by <ORGANIZATION> WBNS-TV </ORGANIZATION> quoted workers as saying substandard parts disappeared after being rejected by plant inspectors. The employees said they believe those parts subsequently were used in building the bombers to meet production schedules. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, called for inquiries as a result of the news report. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said today the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> were aware of the TV report but had no reason to suspect faulty parts had been used in the bomber. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> does not have any evidence at this time which corroborates the assertions by former <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> employees that substandard parts were used in the construction of B-1's,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` However, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is investigating or is looking into these allegations.'' Four B-1B bombers have crashed in the four years since the aircraft began flying as the nation's first new long-range bomber in more than 25 years, including three crashes in the past 14 months and two in the past three weeks. <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, identified as a B-1 inspection manager, said he was told that if he did not reduce the number of finished parts that were stored for inspection, he would be fired. <ORGANIZATION> WBNS </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, identfied as a former quality inspector with <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>, worked over the Fourth of July weekend in 1986 to inspect 1,400 parts after they were threatened with dismissal. The men were later suspended for 17 days after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> questioned the quality of inspections conducted in so short a time, the station said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> wanted a scapegoat, fall guys, so they could say quality problems were taken care of -LRB- and -RRB- let's go on,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> met with an attorney and planned to sue the company if they were fired, <ORGANIZATION> WBNS </ORGANIZATION> said. They ultimately were assigned to less sensitive jobs. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> unit that operated the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> plant, said <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> had investigated similar claims by the two workers previously and found no bad parts had been used. `` We believe similar allegations were made involving <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> in 1985, at which time they were thoroughly investigated and no defective parts were found to have been delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said the company would have to examine the claims in the <ORGANIZATION> WBNS </ORGANIZATION> report before commenting on them. The newscast also reported that other workers said the Air Force was more interested in verifying paperwork than in conducting on-site parts inspections. They also said workers and management knew in advance when inspections would be conducted. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' watchdog agency, released a study saying B-1Bs at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were unable to fly 47 percent to 66 percent of the time because they undergo maintenance `` a significant portion of the time.'' The <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> plant manufactured the housing for the B-1's jet engines, the forward intermediate fuselage of the plane, and what <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> described as a `` primary structural element'' of the supersonic aircraft. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> has ended operations at the plant and has delivered the last B-1 components to its <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, assembly plant, <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>NRC Orders Inspections For Counterfeit Parts At Nuclear Plants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has ordered operators of all commercial nuclear power plants to check their safety systems for counterfeit and possibly faulty circuit breakers. Spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said the order, issued Nov. 22 to the 110 plants, noted that recent inspections `` indicate a potential safety concern.'' But he said there have been no instances where a counterfeit or faulty breaker was blamed for an accident of any kind at a nuclear plant. The order for inspections, which must be carried out by March 1, followed an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigation into allegations that four <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firms had sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> reported in July that it had found 30 counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> nuclear plant near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> found in the same month that it had bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Onofre </LOCATION> plant, 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary `` to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can be operated without undue risk to the public health and safety.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has found `` numerous failures'' of certain types of circuit breakers during preliminary commission-supervised tests, the bulletin said. If a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed _ and it can not be immediately tested _ the utility must submit `` an analysis justifying continued operation,'' the bulletin said. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that the inspection plan was criticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuit breakers. `` The test program is not adequate to provide assurance that the tested ... circuit breakers would be suitable for their intended purpose,'' the laboratory said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> responded by saying that it `` considers the test program to provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements and characteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has told utilities that more than 50 companies may be counterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components.

 The pilot of a wrecked <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jetliner told federal officials looking into last summer's crash that his crew's flight preparations were adequate, although they may have bent some of the rules Delta Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 48, was among the first witnesses to testify in the four-day public hearing before <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators, which began today at an Irving hotel and drew some 200 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 crashed Aug. 31 on takeoff from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing 14 people. Ninety-four people survived. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the plane had no apparent problems, although a fuel gauge did n't work. But the captain said he and his crew followed written procedures to compensate for the faulty gauge. `` The flight was normal. No problem at all to <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'' from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> board of inquiry technical panelist <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorney </PERSON>, an aerospace engineer, questioned <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' handling of pre-flight preparations, including his failure to initiate required checklists and failure to call out the completion of every checklist. <PERSON> Gorney </PERSON> also said a flight attendant was allowed into the cockpit when the plane was waiting to take off. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> admitted the seeming deviations from written regulations, but he still stressed that he thought he and the crew had complied with airline instructions. For instance, the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> veteran of 23 years said he had used hand signals instead of calling out completion of each checklist and made a required takeoff briefing at the gate instead of doing it as the plane was on the runway. `` I like to get as much done as possible before we get into the position of getting rushed,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. He admitted that allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit was against a policy declaring that the cockpit be a `` sterile area'' once it has left the gate. But he noted that the plane was `` waiting in a line of traffic, moving up a space at a time.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was questioned for 63 minutes before <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials declared a break. He was told he would be asked to recount what he had done the previous day, how he had slept the night before the crash, and details of events up to the time of the crash. Thirteen people died as the plane split open and the fuselage exploded in flames just off a runway. One man died later of injuries suffered as he tried to make his way back onto the burning plane in an unsuccessful attempt to save his trapped wife. In addition to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the co-pilot and flight engineer survived and were expected to testify. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, chairman of the board of inquiry, stressed in his opening statements that no conclusions are to be made by the panel during its hearing, but that officials were only gathering information for a final report to be released in six months. But officials of the pilots' union said they believe investigators may have decided on the first day of their investigation that the crew was to blame. `` If you do a quick and dirty investigation, the verdict is going to be quick and dirty _ pilot error,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday at a news conference. The union argues the plane may have had a malfunction called a `` split-flap configuration,'' in which the wing flaps stick in opposing positions _ one extended, one retracted _ robbing the plane of power and lift. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said judging by the list of witnesses and exhibits the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> scheduled for the hearing, it appeared as though the federal board already has pinpointed a cause and was looking at such matters as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s flight safety program. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> responded that the pilots association and other involved parties had all agreed to the witness list two weeks ago.

<HEAD>Government Gets Tough, Calling in Army to Ease Transport Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers in army trucks rolled into the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> region Tuesday to help transport hundreds of thousands of suburban commuters stranded by a transit strike the government called `` union guerrilla warfare.'' The strike called by the communist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> paralyzed two of four lines on the regional express network and was spreading to city subway and bus services. On Monday night, the French government ordered more than 350 military trucks and 1,000 soldiers to supplement private companies called in to move passengers. The military contingent, from Dijon and other areas, was expected to be in operation for morning rush hour Wednesday, with 250 trucks at the suburban terminals of the affected lines, according to Prefect <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, governor of the <LOCATION> Ile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> region. It was expected to take up to 48 hours for all 365 military vehicles to be operational. `` Deterioration of public services forces the government to assume its responsibilities,'' President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. `` That is what the government has done, and done well, notably in calling in the army.'' The transit strike is one of a string of work stoppages plaguing <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for more than a month. Public sector employees ranging from postal workers to nurses, ambulance drivers and even funeral parlor employees have been striking sporadically for increased wages and other benefits. Socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, in power for six months, has remained firm in the face of demands, continuing the tight spending policies in force since 1983. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> ordered strikers' wages suspended and punishment of those engaged in what he said were illegal acts. He said some strikers blocked buses in their terminals, flattened tires and sabotaged engines. This amounted to `` a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment'' in which `` hundreds of thousands of users were being taken hostage,'' the minister said. Blocked terminals, maintenance depots and lack of material were forcing a reduction in city bus and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> service, with buses running at about 60 percent capacity at rush hour Tuesday and one <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> line shut down. The transit authority decided over the weekend to close down the two suburban train lines starting Monday, saying safety could no longer be assured because of the strikers, whose strength is concentrated in the train maintenance forces. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON>, secretary-general of the labor federation, denounced what he called government tactics of `` repression, sanctions and intimidation'' which he said will only `` increase the fighting spirit'' of the strikers. Workers, with an average monthly salary of about $ 1,100, are demanding a $ 170 monthly increase plus improved safety measures. The transit authority most recently proposed increases of about $ 25 plus bonuses ranging from about $ 17 to $ 100. Opposition politicians have criticized <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, saying he has failed to define a policy to deal with public sector grievances. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, re-elected to a seven-year term in May, had made social peace a main campaign pledge. The strike action fanned by the labor federation is widely regarded as a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> effort to undermine the government and strengthen its own hand for municipal elections in March. Party officials deny they are using social discontent for political benefit, and <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON> said the idea was `` completely stupid.'' Job grievances have affected many sectors this fall. Striking postal workers left <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> without mail service for three weeks earlier this month, and mail strikes continue in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amiens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clermont-Ferrand </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marseille </ORGANIZATION> has been hit with strikes by train and bus drivers and social security workers, who are refusing to work in several provincial cities. Other job actions are being carried out at nuclear plants, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> pharmacies and at the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, where guards protesting a change in work hours have been off the job for more than a week.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> next week will visit four <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states that have provided limited support for American forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. A stop aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf also is on the itinerary for what was expected to be <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s last tour before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office in January, said the officials, who asked not to be identified. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> would discuss a variety of regional issues with officials in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. These presumably would include the scaling back of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces following the Iraq-Iran cease-fire. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is including the gulf on a 10-day trip that begins with defense meetings in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and at NATO headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Gulf-based sources, insisting on anonymity, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s visit was primarily in response to an invitation from <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>'s defense minister, <PERSON> Mutassim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Busaidi </PERSON>. The other stops were added for diplomatic reasons, they said. All four <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, though nominally neutral in the Iraq-Iran war, have made facilities of one kind or another available to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces since mid-1987, when the escalating conflict prompted a major buildup of American and other foreign naval units in the gulf. Despite the Aug. 20 cease-fire, in effect ending eight years of Iraq-Iran hostilities, 11 Kuwait-owned oil tankers reflagged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year for protection still sail under the Stars and Stripes. The sources said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s acceptance of the Omani invitation reflected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in nurturing a relationship that gained strength during the war, yet remains more secretive than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with any other gulf Arab state. The Omanis permit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to refuel at a naval depot on the Arabian Sea.

 A computer failure that cost the state up to $ 700,000 in lost lottery ticket sales is being investigated by specialists from the firm that set up the troubled `` Lotto 6-49'' terminals, officials said. Experts from <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, were to inspect the software that caused the 3-year-old lottery's worst computer breakdown. The computer crash came as the state was ending an investigation of problems with <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fined $ 1.7 million for computer mishaps since the company got the `` Lotto 6-49'' contract in October 1986. A report of the investigation is due Friday, said lottery director <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. The computer failure Saturday night affected up to 4,700 of the state lottery's 7,200 `` Lotto 6-49'' terminals. A backup system restored service to all but 120 terminals about 12 minutes later, lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kossack </PERSON> said. `` What is unusual is that all of the terminals on the backup system did not come back up,'' she said. In spite of the outage, three players picked all six numbers correctly to win $ 2 million each. <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION>, which operates Lotto under a $ 220 million five-year contract with the state, is subject to fines for each minute of computer lapse that occurs up to eight hours before the Wednesday and Saturday drawings. <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION> faces a fine of `` close to $ 200,000'' as a result of the failure, lottery computer director <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president, told the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that his company probably would have to pay less than $ 1,000 in fines for Saturday's breakdown <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION> is installing the system for <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s lottery, which is scheduled to begin Jan. 24. In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the Times reported Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION> has been investigated by auditors from the lottery and the state controller's office. The two-month investigation was prompted by allegations from two lottery telecommunications systems analysts who contended that <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION> concealed computer malfunctions to avoid paying the state damages for lost Lotto revenue. <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, chief of security for the state lottery, called the allegations `` just a bunch of baloney.'' He predicted that <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION> will be cleared of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebergall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, declined to discuss the allegations, citing company policy. The two complaining workers, who have been transferred from their jobs pending the investigation, allege that lottery officials are covering up for <ORGANIZATION> GTECH </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>FAA Wants Airlines to Modify Takeoff Alarms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> today proposed modifications in the takeoff alarm systems on virtually all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial jetliners to guard against electrical failures, officials said. The directive, which would apply to more than 3,700 commercial jets, would require installation of a warning light in the cockpit to warn pilots when the takeoff alarm system loses electrical power, the agency said. The alarm is designed to alert a pilot that his plane, and especially control devices such as wing flaps, is not in the proper configuration for a takeoff. Airlines have until February to comment on the proposal and then a year to comply, although some air carriers are expected to make the changes sooner, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the modifications are not expected to interrupt normal airline service because they likely will be done during routine maintenance and would probably take only about 20 hours of work per plane. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said installation of the cockpit light, which must be clearly visible to all flight crew members, is estimated to cost about $ 1,050 per aircraft. The crash on Aug. 16, 1987 of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 during a takeoff from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> was blamed on the failure of the flight crew to set the plane's wing flaps properly for takeoff. The crashed killed 156 people. Investigators also are examining the possibility of an improper flap setting in the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> last August in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed. There was no sounding of the takeoff alarm system in that aircraft either. The <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> crash involved a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-80, while the crash in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> involved a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. According the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the directive will cover virtually all commercial jetliners including those produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium. In some aircraft, the modification may already have been made, one source said. The FAA-directed correction is aimed at warning the flight crew of an electrical short in the alarm system as some investigators have suggested likely occurred in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last May concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 crashed because the pilots did not set the wing flaps to the proper takeoff position, preventing the MD-80 from gaining proper lift. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> determined in the investigation that the alarm, which governed the takeoff flaps, did not sound because of an interruption of electrical power. Investigators could not determine conclusively what caused the power interruption, the safety board said. At the time, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> maintained that there was a possible inherent problem with the alarm systems that made them susceptible to electrical problems. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said it could not determine whether the electrical short was due to such a defect, but also did not rule out the possibility that the flight crew might have pulled a circuit breaker to prevent nuisance alarms.

 A graying group of civil rights warriors, some black and some Jewish, gathered to take a look back at their coalition against segregation and to acknowledge things are no longer the same between them. `` We are not bosom buddies in the way we were in the intense days of the'60s,'' said <PERSON> Courtland </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a black man from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who was among about 70 participants in Monday's sessions of a conference aimed at chronicling black-Jewish cooperation. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> and several other black speakers emphasized the potential for reuniting the groups, which have sometimes clashed over methods of integration, the rights of Palestinians under the Jewish government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and alleged anti-Semitism by some blacks. `` There was some ambivalence where the movement was split, but now we can heal those splits,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a black who helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>. Farmer recalled his trip to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in 1964 to investigate the disappearances of three civil rights workers. Two of them, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, were Jewish, and <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> authorities referred to them as `` Jew boys.'' The two, along with a black man, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, were later found dead. Even earlier, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said, Jews became natural allies of blacks because of anti-Semitism fanned by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the lynching of Jewish businessman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1915. `` Jewish Americans came to realize that their enemies were the enemies of blacks, too,'' he said. Conference participants today held a memorial service for the movement's martyrs and others who have died in the intervening years. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, mother of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, read a brief quotation from the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, brother of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, read from `` The Diary of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'' during the service. They joined hands as the group concluded the service by singing, `` We Shall Overcome.'' Most speakers at the sessions found no fault with self-interest as a motive for Jewish aid to the civil rights movement. But one black participant, <PERSON> Lolis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said he found Jews no more helpful than other whites except for the fear of their own persecution. `` I think that many of the Jews, almost in gratitude, feel that blacks have taken a lot of the punishment that Jews would have to take if blacks were not present,'' <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> said. Rabbi <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresner </PERSON> said his religious beliefs propelled him into the `` freedom rides'' and four arrests in the South. `` I came because that's what <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> teaches ... that we are all part of the human family,'' said <PERSON> Dresner </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` I came because of Jewish history. I came because of the Holocaust. I came because of slavery in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' For <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a former staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Legal Defense Fund, the process worked in reverse. `` A large part of my identity as a Jew comes out of that struggle of blacks and Jews together,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, and several other black speakers praised their Jewish colleagues and downplayed the importance of their motives. `` I do n't want to argue about intent, I want to argue about effect,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. On Monday evening, the group went to the crypt of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change. `` Somewhere along the way, we sort of lost contact,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, said. He called for a renewed black-Jewish coalition to battle threats such as racist `` skinhead'' groups. The conference, titled `` The Black-Jewish Alliance: Reunion and Renewal,'' is sponsored by the King and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> centers, the Washington-based <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovler </PERSON> Institute for Black-Jewish Relations and the <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats today elected <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> as their majority leader and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he was ready to `` move forward'' with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House on the federal deficit and other major issues. The senator from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was elected in a closed meeting by a unanimous voice vote after first narrowly missing a majority in his race against Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The federal deficit, health care, day care and the environment were top priorities, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who planned to meet Wednesday with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, re-elected by Republicans as their leader earlier in the day. Asked if he would cooperate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` We hope to move forward on a broad range of issues.'' `` The Democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals of the next administration,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, elected in 1982 and re-elected earlier this month, will succeed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who decided to step down as majority leader to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who was also elected as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s President Pro Tempore, announced the vote to reporters. He handed his gavel to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> before television cameras, then stepped back as his successor moved to the microphones to take questions. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> will become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> garnered 27 votes on the first ballot, one short of a majority among the 55 Democrats in the new Senate. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> each received 14. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> then moved that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> be approved unanimously; <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> seconded the motion. After the vote, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said: `` The best man won. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> will be a great majority leader.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was re-elected as the party's whip, defeating Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> There was no recorded vote. Although the least senior of the three candidates, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is considered a strong spokesman for the party. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> liberal, the former federal prosecutor and judge has a reputation as a skilled, thoughtful legislator. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 55, is a liberal like <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> but less tradition-bound. He appealed to Democrats seeking someone who would appear less ideological but still could act as a strong public speaker for the party. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> will bring to the post of majority leader a far different style than <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who was Democratic leader for a decade. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s tenure was marked by his mastery and manipulation of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules and his distinctive personality. Although very secretive about his legislative dealings, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> would display before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> his memory of poetry and history, both of which he would recite at length in the chamber. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is less of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> institution and far more open personally than <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Although more liberal, Democratic colleagues describe him as a consensus builder and not an ideologue. And, while relations between <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> often seemed strained, there is potential for a strong working relationship between <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The two men have served together since 1981 on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and always speak well of each other. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, 64, pitched himself as the most experienced of the three.

 Residents used to climbing down a steep bank to dip muddy water out a stream have won a 15-year battle to have clean water pumped into their southwestern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town. The community of 40 residents 65 miles southwest of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will receive a $ 105,500 <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 50,500 loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to hook up with the water system in nearby <LOCATION> Pattison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> announced this week. He said workers hope to supply water within four months to <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where only three residents could afford wells. Many residents have relied on rain and creek water for bathing and on friends in neighboring communities for drinking water. `` We did n't have much other choice,'' said <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 65, who has sometimes driven his truck to the creek two or three times a day to fill containers with water. `` Most of the others had to do the same thing.'' The project will assure a safe drinking water supply for <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> residents, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chief of the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any time you can bring running water into a community and fresh water directly to the houses, you improve living standards and help in protecting the health'' of people living there, he said. `` This is the cry of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> told the residents and officials gathered at the creek bank Monday. `` Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, at least since 1981, has n't been high on the agenda of the people who control the purse strings.'' <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> added similar water problems exist in communities in three other <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> counties. The grant could not have come soon enough for residents here. `` We need it bad,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s son, as he knelt over the creek. `` We've been going there to get water for 15 years.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who has a well, said he shared water with residents who lived across the creek until a wooden bridge over the creek washed out a year ago. `` We've been fighting for it for 15 years. Our people've just been put off,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said.

 With the New Age Telephone Book, you can reach waaaaaaaay out and touch someone. The directory lists psychics, healers, numerologists, gurus, channelers, ghost hunters and almost anyone else who may appeal to followers of New Age philosophies. A real estate agent, for instance, offers clients `` your own place in the universe.'' A `` gentle dentist'' promises free wine and stereo headphones. A medical clinic tells AIDS patients that their best years are yet to come. `` We want to be the book that you pick up first if you have this particular consciousness,'' said managing editor <PERSON> Caryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>. `` After all, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Bell Yellow Pages does n't exactly have a category for rebirthers.'' <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, the directory's publisher, and <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who also publish gay and lesbian directories, printed 50,000 copies for shipment mainly to stores catering to New Age clientele, where it is distributed free.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has been talked about as a potential defense secretary for the better part of a decade, so it's no surprise that he's now considered the front-runner for that post in the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. But it is n't coming easily, with almost daily reports of negotiations over conditions President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to set before appointing his fellow Texan. No one doubts the military expertise of the 63-year-old Tower. He was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when he retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after 24 years. And he served as an arms negotiator for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after that. By all accounts, despite apparent opposition from some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides, Tower is the leading choice to head the Pentagon for the new president. However, he was mentioned as a possible <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ a development that never occurred. A source close to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office said Tuesday that a decision on Tower could come by Wednesday. The source, who spoke only on condition he not be named, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likes Tower and thinks he would do a good job at the Pentagon. But some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers have raised objections, partly because they do not have a high regard for a number of people who have worked for Tower and might have an inside track for top Pentagon jobs should he be named. The negotiations supposedly concern who would control which appointments on Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> team. Tower himself has said little in public in recent days. His aides say each day, when asked: No call from the White House yet. Tower has worked for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before. In fact, he was one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s key emissaries to the platform committee at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> last summer _ essentially speaking for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the negotiations In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Tower championed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military buildup and increase in defense spending, but if he gets the Pentagon job he'll become <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point man And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in publicly describing the role of his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, said last week that his nominee must be willing `` to take a fresh, tough look in these times of budgetary crunch at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' Also, the president-elect's choice for national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> suggested cuts of at least $ 300 billion from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's military spending plans for 1990 to 1994. The suggestions were included in a report presented to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by former Presidents Ford and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. On other military subjects, Tower: _ Favors <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, popularly known as Star Wars, and is a leading supporter of the MX missile He has called them `` important elements in negotiating'' with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. _ Despite supporting the MX, opposes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan for fixed deployment of the weapon, preferring the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration's plan to move the missile _ Opposes the unratified 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a pact that Tower believes does not reduce nuclear capabilities Shortly after retiring from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Tower was named a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> where he concentrated on reduction of long-range nuclear weapons. He quit that post after 14 months for what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said privately were family reasons and because he believed the job lacked excitement. In November 1986, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chose Tower to head a commission investigating the Iran-Contra affair. In its final report issued in February 1987, the panel blamed the arms-for-hostages dealing in part on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s laid-back management style. It had little to say about any possible <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> involvement. Tower gained national attention in 1960 when he lost to Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who ran for both re-election and the vice presidency. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> resigned his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat and Tower defeated the appointed replacement, Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakley </PERSON>, in a special election, by a mere 8,000-vote margin. The son of a Methodist minister, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, a one-time Democrat, former radio announcer and insurance salesman, was the first Republican elected by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators in the post-Civil War period had been named by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. In the earlier campaign against <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the 5-foot-6 Tower won over voters with his self-deprecating line, `` My name is Tower _ but you can see that I do n't.'' In his last re-election campaign, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> refused to shake his opponent's hand when they met by accident, and he described his rival as a `` little Lord <PERSON> Fauntleroy </PERSON>.'' Tower recently was divorced from his second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>. The messy legal battle included accusations that Tower committed `` marital misconduct.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> thought the radio contest was too easy: Answer a question about the first day of autumn and win `` keys to a brand-new Porsche.'' Two months later, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, the WLS-AM disc jockey who made the offer, has been fired, and <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> is still waiting for a Porsche. He has n't even gotten the keys, he says. `` I got through and I gave him the right answer,'' <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON>, a 21-year-old biology student at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said Monday. After receiving a letter from <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON>'s lawyer, who also is his brother, station managers fired <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>. But they still say the whole thing was obviously a joke and they have no intention of giving away a Porsche. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> offered the keys to the first caller who could explain `` what was special'' about the day, Sept. 22. <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON>, listening to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> station from his home in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was the first person to call and say it was the first day of autumn. `` You win the keys to the car,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said, according to a transcript read by <ORGANIZATION> WLS </ORGANIZATION> operations manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippincott </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> asked if it was a joke, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said it was n't, adding: `` I have absolutely no idea where the car is, but you get the keys.'' About a month later, <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> mentioned the incident to his brother <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> said radio contests are regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which requires that stations deliver what they promise. `` It was definitely my brother's understanding that he would win the car,'' he said Monday. When <ORGANIZATION> WLS </ORGANIZATION> received a letter from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> on Nov. 14 inquiring about the car, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> was suspended. He was fired three days later, <PERSON> Lippincott </PERSON> said. McDonald's telephone number could not be obtained through directory information, and the station would not provide it. The station does n't plan to give away a car. `` I do n't think we owe the guy a <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lippincott </PERSON> said. `` It's obvious from the transcript that he understood he won the keys and not the car.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON> will drive his Datsun, with 140,000 miles on it.

<HEAD>Report Says Meat Inspection System Broken Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The system set up by the government to assure that meat produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is free of dangerous chemicals has broken down, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> investigators reported. The results of an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> Office of Inspector General were contained in a report circulated among <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials. The findings were reported Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>. The report said testing at meat plants was not done randomly, allowing violators to avoid detection. When chemical contamination was found, action was seldom taken to prevent sale of the tainted meat, the report said. Federal officials were unable in most cases to trace animals with illegal chemical or pesticide residues to producers and seldom took follow-up samples to determine if the violations were continuing, the report said. The report said `` some adulterated products were allowed to enter commerce.'' Because the department did not consult the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on what residue levels are safe, there is no assurance pesticides are being monitored `` at levels necessary to protect the public health,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for ensuring that government-inspected meat and poultry are wholesome. Inspectors are to randomly collect meat and poultry samples at plants, and if high levels of residue are detected, movement of the meat to market is supposed to be controlled and the producers are to be identified. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> is hampered by laws that allow testing only at slaughter plants. It recommended laws allowing testing at production and sales sites. The report said samples were gathered at some plants at routine and predictable times. `` Such trends could allow plants to manipulate slaughter schedules to prevent detection of known or suspected violations,'' the report said.

 Two explosions rocked a highway construction site early today, killing six firefighters battling suspicious fires at the scene, officials said. The force of the blasts shattered windows 10 miles away. The blasts left two large craters _ 30 to 40 feet wide and six or seven feet deep. The charred wreckage of one firetruck was near one of the craters, but `` the other firetruck ... there is absolutely no evidence that it was ever there,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON>. A seventh firefighter, who was near the site with a department car, was injured and taken to the hospital, said <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON>. The first blast, shortly after 4 a.m., involved an estimated 30,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON> said. About 20 minutes later there was a second explosion that involved about 15,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Residents of a two-mile area around the blast site were evacuated. One resident was hospitalized in good condition after complaining of chest pains, and five other residents went to Research Medical Center but were released after treatment or observation. <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON> said a first fire was spotted in a pickup truck while two guards looked for someone they thought they had seen in the area. A second fire broke out in a trailer that contained explosives, and it spread to a second trailer. `` We're assuming that someone did set both fires because both of them did occur when both security people were away from the area,'' <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON> said. The guards were not hurt, he said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said he could not estimate the size of the two trailers that exploded because `` there ai n't nothing there anymore.'' Firefighters and a bomb squad moved into the area of the blast around daybreak to look for other explosives. Authorities said the victims' bodies had been recovered. The Fire Department called the deaths the department's worst loss since record-keeping started in 1899. The most deaths among firefighters previously, five, occurred in a gasoline storage tank explosion in August 1959. The explosions occurred at a construction site on the southern edge of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 1 -LCB- miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bannister </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, one of the area's busiest shopping malls. A number of quarries are located adjacent to the highway construction site. `` We have a very serious situation.

The ammonium nitrate was stored at the site and was used to blast the quarry and clear rock for the highway construction, officials said. Authorities said windows were blown out of homes and businesses over at least a 10-mile area around the site. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>, manager of a service station in the neighborhood, said the first blast `` lifted my cash register about 3 inches off the counter. It knocked a lot of merchandise over or off my shelves.'' About a dozen windows were broken at <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s distribution and computer center near the blast site <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, a company spokesman, said five people working in the building at the time of the explosion escaped injury. He said the 75 to 100 people who work there were told to stay home for the day. The nearby <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also sustained damaged, and workers there were told not to report to work today. Power was knocked out in the area for about one hour. Several residents said the explosions almost lifted them out of their beds. <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON> said the first two fire crews at the scene called for a battalion chief. Firefighters were battling the blaze in the first trailer when the battalion chief arrived and the first explosion occurred. `` As his driver got out of the car, the explosion knocked him several feet, blew out the window in the chief's car and threw it back on the chief. The chief managed to get the radio and call for additional help,'' <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON> said. He said the explosion spread fire to the second trailer, which exploded 20 minutes later. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> estimated that the battalion chief's car, about 150 feet from the burning trailer, was knocked back about 25 feet, but he was not injured. People in the area complained of natural gas leaks after the explosions, said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> KPL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said utility crews have not been able to get into the area of the explosion to determine the extent of damage to the company's

 A divided <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a decision some members said is unnecessarily sweeping, ruled Tuesday the rights of criminal defendants are not violated when police unintentionally fail to preserve potentially vital evidence. The court also said the Constitution does not require police to conduct state-of-the-art tests in examining evidence. By a 6-3 vote, the justices reinstated an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> man's conviction in the kidnaping and sodomizing of a 10-year-old boy The justices reversed a lower court ruling that the man's rights were violated because police failed to preserve and analyze properly semen samples from the child's body and clothing _ evidence which, in theory, could have exonerated the defendant. In another decision, the high court reinforced the right of the poor to have a lawyer's help in appealing convictions. The justices, voting 8-1, said an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> appeals court improperly allowed an attorney to withdraw from representing a convicted rapist and robber without explaining in detail why he believed an appeal was frivolous. In the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> case, an appeals court threw out the conviction and 10-year prison sentence of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>. He was convicted of kidnapping a boy on Oct. 29, 1983 from a church carnival in the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> area. Police said the boy was driven to a house, raped four times during a 90-minute ordeal and then released. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in his opinion for the high court Tuesday, said <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> did not prove that police deliberately failed to preserve evidence. `` Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. `` Requiring a defendant to show bad faith on the part of police both limits the extent of the police's obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable bounds and confines it to ... those cases in which police themselves ... indicate that the evidence could form a basis for exonerating the defendant,'' he said. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said the obligation of authorities to preserve evidence is not as great as their duty to turn over to defendants all existing evidence, including material that could help acquit the accused. Also, he continued, the Constitution does not require police to use the best available technology to test the reliability of evidence. Comparing the case to one in which police fail to use a Breathalyzer to determine if a motorist was intoxicated, he added, `` Police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests.'' But Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion, said police `` ineptitude'' deprived <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> of his right to a fair trial. `` The Constitution requires that criminal defendants be provided with a fair trial, not merely a good faith try at a fair trial,'' he said. `` By what may have been nothing more than police ineptitude, -LRB- <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> -RRB- was denied the opportunity to present a full defense.'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> also said there was no need for the court to decide whether police must use the cutting edge of technology in analyzing evidence. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> joined the majority in voting to reinstate <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>'s conviction. But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the court went too far in holding that criminal defendants must prove bad faith by police when crucial evidence is lost or destroyed. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, convicted of child molesting, sexual assault and kidnapping, was identified as the assailant from police photographs shown to the boy. Laboratory specialists found traces of semen on the boy and also in clothing he was wearing. It was not until a year later that the semen was tested to determine blood typing of the assailant. But no blood group substances were found. The semen sample taken from the boy's body was refrigerated. The clothing, which might have contained a larger quantity of semen, was not. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> was determined to be what is known as a secretor, with blood type A. That means that his blood group could be determined from his semen. The absence of blood group substances in the semen taken from the victim suggested that the boy's attacker either was a non-secretor or that the samples were too small to determine blood type. There also was testimony that technologically advanced tests to determine blood grouping were not performed on the semen samples. An <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> appeals court threw out <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>'s conviction on grounds that had state-of-the-art tests been performed and had the best technology been used to preserve the evidence, <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> might have been found innocent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Miracle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay a $ 100,000 civil penalty and to make corrections on several of the public playground equipment products it sells, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. The monetary payment settled charges that Miracle failed to promptly report defects in its Bounce-Around Whirl and Buckaroo Whirl playground devices, which were subject to a repair program in 1983. Those products had been associated with 70 injuries to the legs of children, the commission said. The new agreement calls for corrections for other products, including the Flying Animal Swing, which has been blamed for one death and seven injuries to children struck by the swing, the commission said. Also to be corrected are the Lifetime Whirl, Slashproof Swing Set, <ORGANIZATION> Arch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swing </ORGANIZATION> and Therapeutic Whirl, which have been associated with 50 injuries, according to the safety agency. In announcing the settlement, the commission noted that Miracle has denied that any of its products are defective or that they pose a substantial risk to children. The company has also denied violating product reporting rules. In addition, the agency noted that it has made no formal finding of violations by the company. However, the company agreed to notify its customer list of the settlement and make any repairs necessary. Anyone needing more information can contact Miracle at 1-800-523-4202 or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

 The General Assembly today delayed its annual debate on the Palestinian problem, the first step toward convening a special session outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to hear <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. General Assembly President <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> told the assembly he had received a request from Arab nations to postpone the debate scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Dec. 6. Since there were no objections, <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said, the request was granted. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, the Argentine foreign minister, said earlier the assembly would move swiftly to provide <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> an alternative forum. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Saturday denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> an entry visa. Diplomats have said that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reverses its decision, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debate on <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> will shift to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. No new date has been set for the debate. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> representatives today drafted a resolution expressing regret over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action and saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violated its legal obligations by denying <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa. The resolution was to be introduced later today before a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee and may go to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> late today or Wednesday. Saturday's decision by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to bar <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from the country on grounds he was an `` accessory'' to acts of terrorism against Americans has been widely criticized by dozens of countries, including the Arab world and such staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> backed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to deny the visa was `` firm and final.'' A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still refuses to grant <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa, another resolution probably will called this week for moving the assembly to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Arab diplomats say they have enough votes, a simple majority in the 159-member body, to shift the assembly to where <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would be able to speak. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> legal counsel <PERSON> Carl-August </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision violates the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement that requires the host country to grant visas to people invited by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The agreement does not contain a reservation of the right to bar the entry of those who represent, in the view of the host country, a threat to its sovereignty and security,'' <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, alternate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government disagreed with <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON>'s interpretation, but she did not elaborate. Many nations in the world body said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action countered what they described as the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s move toward modernization with its declaration of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> independence Nov. 15 that also implicitely recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> heard numerous speakers assail the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to ban <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Iraqi Ambassdador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> told the committee: `` The decision by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a slap in the face, of equal measure, to every member of this organization.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, among others, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should be allowed to speak. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move `` a sheer violation of the international law and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter'' and said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was ignoring international backing for the independent state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, proclaimed this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the shift to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was unnecessary because other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could speak instead of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` Probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at the peace process as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marln </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We were making no kind of statement about the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, but about <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and terrorism.''

 State officials say the fatal collapse of a ride at the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> may lead to new safety regulations, but they may not get much help from a consultant studying the wreckage. One of six arms on the `` Monster'' ride broke at a paint-covered crack on Nov. 23, dropping four baskets carrying passengers 10 feet to the ground. A 17-year-old girl died and six other people were injured. State Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, who oversees the state's six-person <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairs </ORGANIZATION> and Expositions, is studying the accident with an eye toward improving state inspections of carnival rides. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s senior executive assistant, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> will make recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> during its January committee meetings covering staffing, training and inspection procedure. Meanwhile, a consultant studying the broken ride said he does n't plan to make his findings public <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, dean of graduate studies and research at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here, said Monday he is not working for the state but for a company that insures the operator of the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> midway. His findings `` may only become available in a legal proceeding,'' <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said. After the accident, <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, director of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairs </ORGANIZATION> and Expositions, said he was counting on answers from <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>'s metallurgical and X-ray tests. `` We're hoping he can tell us the speed of the ride and what caused the fracture to become a complete break,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said last week. `` We also want to determine how long the fracture has been there and if there are fractures of the other -LRB- five -RRB- arms.'' But <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said if any legal problems over the teen-ager's death are settled out of court, it is possible the metal test results may never be known.

<HEAD>Presidential Council Rejects Bill to Enforce Racist Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential council Tuesday rejected a proposed bill that would have tightened enforcement of residential segregation laws. Anti-apartheid leaders welcomed the move but urged the government to scrap all discriminatory laws, including measures extreme-right local officials are using to resegregate public facilities. Last week, the Conservative Party-controlled town council in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> voted to bar blacks from most municipal facilities. On Tuesday, Conservative councilors in <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION>, another industrial town near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, similarly decided to ban blacks from public parks, toilets and sports facilities. The President's Council, dominated by the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sent the residential segregation bill back to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> with a recommendation it be redrafted to ease penalties and decriminalize some offenses related to the Group Areas Act. The act, a cornerstone of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s legalized race segregation called apartheid, prevents people of one race from living in areas designated for each of the other race groups. The bill was referred to the council because of a deadlock in Parliament: it was passed by the National Party-dominated white chamber but rejected by the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and mixed-race chambers. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s majority 26 million blacks are not represented in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and have no vote in national affairs. The proposal to impose sharply increased fines on violators of the Group Areas Act had been widely criticized abroad and by anti-apartheid activists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Even before it reached the President's Council, the bill was softened by removal of a proposal for mandatory evictions of people living illegally outside their designated race zones. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marais </PERSON>, a mixed-race council member, likened the bill to Nazi persecution of the Jews. Several anti-apartheid council members said discriminatory laws caused the current controversy in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>. `` What is happening in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> must be a lesson to all of us,'' said <PERSON> Marais </PERSON>. `` Do n't leave matches lying around for children to play with.'' The actions in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> have been criticized by government officials, white businessmen and sports organizations, as well as local blacks who have begun to boycott the industrial town's white-owned businesses Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> warned it could cause tougher sanctions and urged people to oppose discrimination based `` merely on the color of one's skin.'' Businessmen and several national sports organizaions have warned they will shun <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> because of the negative publicity. Some liberals suggested the outcry was hypocritical because <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> council is exercising discriminatory powers allowed under the National Party-approved Separate Amenities Act and employed elsewhere, including in the capital city, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> seems to be missing the point,'' said <PERSON> Jannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Momberg </PERSON>, co-chairman of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is doing is legal ... It's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> laws that have given <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a bad name.''

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> bowed to criticism of his constitutional reforms Tuesday, saying he will accept tighter limits on presidential power and try to accommodate republics clamoring for more autonomy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, acknowledging the political give-and-take forming in the freer atmosphere he has fostered, told the Supreme Soviet, or parliament: `` Our own socialist system of ` checks and balances' is taking shape in this country, designed to protect society from any violations of socialist legality at the highest state level.'' The Supreme Soviet is considering during its three-day session a package of almost 120 articles of legislation first published five weeks ago that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says are the first major step toward a political system based on law, not central dictate. But the draft laws faced stiff criticism that they actually stengthen the presidency, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed on Oct. 1, against the legislature, and strengthen <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s power against that of the 15 Soviet republics. The unprecedented criticism of the proposed legislation was highlighted by the Estonian republic's Nov. 16 `` declaration of sovereignty'' over all internal affairs and demand to review all new Soviet legislation. Several Supreme Soviet deputies, including two top officials from the Baltic republics, registered dissatisfaction Tuesday with elements of the reform. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON>, the Estonian president, told reporters that Surpreme Soviet deputies only received copies of the amended proposals on Tuesday. They have not been published. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, detailing some of the changes to the 1,500 Supreme Soviet members, said, `` It is obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not formulated precisely enough and cuased quite a few critical remarks in the course of discussions.'' `` The draft now gives the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> Supreme Soviet the right to repeal decrees and decisions by its Presidium, and orders by the Supreme Soviet president,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. That was implied in the Soviet Constitution, which requires Supreme Soviet confirmation of directives of the Presidium, the highest executive body on which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> serves as chairman. But the Supreme Soviet almost never has challenged any such directive, and the proposed constitutional amendments said nothing about Supreme Soviet review. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms call for the formation next year of a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a 2,250-member legislative body that will include representation from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade and creative unions, and social organizations as well as geographical legislative districts. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will choose a smaller Supreme Soviet, which is to become more active. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have power to recall any official it appoints, including the president. The Supreme Soviet would have the powers of budget oversight and review of the actions of government ministries. `` This right will definitely be used regularly in the new conditions,'' he said. It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was giving up his proposal to strengthen the president by giving his the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and responsibility for foreign policy. In order to further strengthen the system of checks and balances, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a constitutional review commission would be formed, and that judges would be given considerably more independence. To meet complaints from small republics the amendments now give all 15 republics stronger representation in one house of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet of Nationalities. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who led the Presidium on Saturday in rejecting <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s challenge, stressed the economic unity of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But a specific criticism of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> originally included in a summary of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency did not appear in the final version, and he struck a conciliatory note. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed creating a special commission to settle the question of division of powers between the central government and the republics. Soviet Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, in a news conference, told reporters that a section allowing central authorities to declare a state of emergency and call in soldiers to keep order had been amended to assure the republics any such operation would be temporary, and that they would be consulted. `` We are not approaching the constitution and the republics as something that has been set once and forever. There will be changes and amendments,'' he said. But leaders of two Baltic republics still objected. Latvian President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> said direct representation of social and political organizations in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> could result in one person holding several seats in the the congress Another Baltic republic president, <PERSON> Vitautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Astrauskas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, called for a new constitution limiting the central government to national issues. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ideology chief, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told a news conference that he believed the Estonian measures were `` adopted spontaneously under public sentiment and emotion that for a certain time got the upper hand in the republic.'' `` I'm not inclined to agree they are an adequate reflection of public opinion in that republic,'' he said.

 A Japanese man called an international terrorist by prosecutors was found guilty Tuesday of weapons charges and of transporting homemade bombs with the intent to commit sabotage. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> convicted <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> in a non-jury trial after the 36-year-old defendant admitted to the government's charges in an agreement worked out with prosecutors. `` There is no contest and there is no alternative,'' <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> said. `` I find the defendant <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> guilty of each count of the indictment.'' <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> set sentencing for Jan. 23. Kikumura faces up to 100 years in prison. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> admitted to the charges but retained his right to appeal pre-trial rulings. If the pre-trial rulings, which bear on the admissibility of evidence against him, are overturned, his conviction could be thrown out. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said outside court that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> had come to this country `` to kill people.'' `` This man is an international terrorist who sneaked into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using a skillfully forged passport,'' he said. `` He's someone who would have killed if he had not been stopped. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> would say little about <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s target, but that more information might emerge at sentencing. `` We're talking about buildings in which there are people,'' he said. The government has tied Kikumura to the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and has said it is investigating his connections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was caught several days before the bombing of a U.S.O. club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. A day later, the finance ministers of seven major industrial nations ended a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Court documents showed <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> traveled about 7,000 miles around the country after arriving five weeks before his arrest. He acquired equipment to make the bombs _ three fire extinguisher casings containing lead shot and gun powder _ on the trip. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, had said Monday in court that they could not defeat the evidence and would seek to have the charges thrown out on appeal. Their announcement came on the first day of trial and moments after <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> rebuffed a last-ditch effort to have the indictment dismissed because of the routine recording of <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s calls to his attorneys from the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> has been at the federal lockup since shortly after his arrest April 12 at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> rest area in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was charged with one count of transporting explosives interstate without a permit; one count of transporting explosives with intent to kill, injure or damage property; one count of possession of firearms by an alien; three counts of possessing unregistered firearms; three counts of possessing firearms without serial numbers; and three counts of using false travel documents. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said they would appeal <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON>'s refusal to find a state trooper's search of <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s car unconstitutional and thus suppress the evidence. They said they also will seek to trim the number of counts in the indictment and to dismiss the case because of the prison phone recordings. The arresting trooper said at an October hearing that the bombs were in plain view in <LOCATION> Kikumura </LOCATION>'s car and that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> acted suspiciously. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> said the bombs were in the trunk, that he was not acting suspiciously and that he never gave permission to search his car. <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> said he found the trooper more credible. He did not mention the witness testimony of a gas station attendant who supported Kikumura's version. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said he never asked his client what he was doing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Economy Weathers Drought Without Major Damage So Far, But Inflation
Grows</HEAD>

 The nation's economy shrugged off the summer drought and grew at a respectable 2.6 percent annual rate in the July-September period, but inflation picked up, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the performance of the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed in the third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the second quarter and 3.4 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, when the economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate. However, the department said the picture was distorted by the summer drought that hit much of the nation. Without the drought, growth would have been 3.9 percent in the second quarter and 3.2 percent in the third quarter. So far, a little less than half of the $ 12.8 billion in drought losses have been accounted for in the GNP. They are likely to shave as much as 1.2 percent off the fourth quarter average. `` If we had n't had a drought where cows died and grain dried up, GNP would have been much stronger,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the school of business at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` What that tells you is you have one hot economy on your hands.'' But higher prices accompanied the growth. The government said a price index tied to the GNP, which is adjusted to exclude the effects of changing buying patterns, rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the third quarter, edging up from 5.0 percent in the second quarter. It was the steepest increase in more than six years. The growth figure and the price index represent revisions from an advance estimate last month, when GNP was reported at a 2.2 percent rate and the price index at 4.9 percent. In other economic developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that after-tax corporate profits in the third quarter were nearly flat They rose only 0.2 percent to $ 163.1 billion, following an exceptionally large increase of 8.9 percent a quarter earlier. It was corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest performance since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> predicted food prices would rise by 3 percent to 5 percent next year, after rising about 4 percent this year The forecast came from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, chairman of the department's <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the latest GNP report does not change `` the basic economic picture'' of moderate growth and steady inflation. `` Inflation remains at about the second-quarter rate. And after adjusting for the effects of the drought, the economy continues to grow at its long-term average pace, which is 2 to 3 percent,'' he said. However, private economists said the GNP report fits in with expectations in financial markets that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will move soon to dampen growth, particularly if the November unemployment report, due this Friday, shows unemployment continuing at a 14-year low. Growth so far in the second half of the year `` is too fast for stable inflation, which suggests there could be some further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening over the next few months,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Factories are operating at their highest level in more than eight years That, coupled with fewer people looking for jobs, could make it difficult for manufacturers to produce enough goods to meet demand. Higher interest rates are aimed at easing the demand by discouraging spending by both consumers and businesses. On Monday, major banks raised their prime lending rate to 10.5 percent, the highest level since mid-1985. That will increase rates on a variety of consumer loans. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decides to tigthen, the prime rate could jump again before the end of the year, analysts say. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the mix of economic activity in the third quarter moved in the opposite direction from what <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers want. Personal consumption expenditures, which account for nearly two-thirds of economic activity, rose at an annual rate of 4 percent, compared with 3.0 percent in the second quarter. The two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year _ exports and business investment _ played lesser roles. The nation's inflation-adjusted trade deficit as measured by the GNP grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, the first deterioration in a year. Business investment grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 15.0 percent in the second quarter. `` Consumer spending -LRB- growth -RRB- is at least double what they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> members -RRB- want to see. ... That's excessive if we want to bring down our trade deficit without kicking up inflation,'' <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual rate of $ 4.01 trillion.

 A Roman Catholic bishop and six other anti-abortion activists were released today after serving an overnight jail sentence for an illegal protest against a women's clinic Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the other activists began their two-day sentences in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prison about noon Monday, said warden <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frame </PERSON>. Officials said they counted the time the seven spent in jail Monday and today as two days, even though the group was there for only parts of each day. Frame's office said all were released about 10 a.m. today. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said they know of no other bishop in recent years who has served a jail term. `` No one here can recall a precedent,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eifert </PERSON>, an information officer for the bishops' conference. The four men and three women were among 591 people arrested July 5 at the Women's Suburban Clinic in <LOCATION> Paoli </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, after they blocked clinic entrances in defiance of two court orders. They were the first of more than 400 people scheduled to go to prison. Earlier, Frame would not disclose whether the activists would receive special treatment, saying their housing would be up to the prison's classification committee. `` We will do what we feel is best for the prison and also for them,'' he said in a telephone interview. The prison, with a capacity of 280 inmates, is holding 494, he said. District Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mull </PERSON> found all the defendants guilty of defiant trespass and fined them $ 10 plus $ 50.50 in court costs during their trials. Those who refused to pay on grounds of conscience were sentenced to two days in prison to be served 10 at a time starting every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. One man has appealed, said court secretary <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Before appearing in court, <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> led a Mass at nearby <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norbert </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiberg </PERSON>, who estimated about 450 to 500 people, including 15 priests, attended. `` They're still killing 1.5 million babies a year. ... They're the future of our country,'' <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> said just before going to jail Of the protesters arrested, about 405 people refused to pay the fines, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> in a statement. Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said about 100 fines had been paid. <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacElree </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had said he was hoping the fines would repay Tredyffrin Township the more than $ 12,000 in arrest and booking costs incurred the day of the protest. It costs $ 40 per day to house each inmate, Frame said. The protest was organized by Operation Rescue, the <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based coalition that orchestrated protests at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and in dozens of other cities around the nation, resulting in about 9,000 arrests this year. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Magera </PERSON>, assistant to the director of Operation Rescue, said <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> was arrested during an abortion protest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in May, but those charges were dismissed. Besides <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, those entering prison Monday were <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Parkesburg </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Willsher </PERSON> of Reading; the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doron </PERSON>, pastor of the non-denominational Church of the New Covenant in <LOCATION> Marlton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossens </PERSON> of Beechwood, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glassboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

 A handwritten letter by <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON> outlining secret plans to invade <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> sold at auction Tuesday for $ 21,186 to a French collector. This rare glimpse of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s genius was the highlight of a sale of rare books letters and manuscripts of some of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most famous writers. `` The four-page letter in <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s own hand is a piece of French history,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Tajan </PERSON> of the Ader-Picard-Tajan auction house. `` If the plan to invade <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had worked, the map of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may well have been modified.'' The buyer's identity was not revealed. An unusually rare eight-volume edition of the works of Moliere _ creator of French high comedy _ was sold for $ 322,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Bibliotheque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION>. It is one of four first editions dating from 1673. The sale at the year-old Drouot auction house annex, off the Champs Elysees, attracted military history buffs and bibliophiles. It offered 50 pages of letters written by the French novelist <PERSON> Stendhal </PERSON> while he followed <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s armies in 1812-13. In one letter, he describes the horror of the burning of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> while complaining about his empty stomach, nagging toothache and the vulgarity of his compatriots. One addressed to his sister, dated Oct. 4, 1812, went to the French Archives for $ 35,590. `` We left the city, illuminated by the most beautiful fire in the world ... The moon, I believe, shone above the fire. It was a great spectacle, but one had to be alone to see it. This is the sad condition which ruined for me the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> campaign: to have been with people who would have destroyed the Colosseum and the sea of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stendhal </PERSON> wrote. All items were part of the vast collection of <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON>, leading French collector and the man who defended the young <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Proust </PERSON> long before `` Remembrance of Things Past'' was universally acclaimed. The letter from <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> to Admiral Ganteaume, written Dec. 7, 1803, details three daring strategies for maneuvering 60 French ships across the English Channel. `` Let us be masters of the strait for six hours and we will be masters of the world,'' <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> wrote. The most complex of the plans involved moving one fleet to <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> and another toward <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> to trick <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Lord <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> into heading for <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, while British land forces would be tied up protecting the country's western coast against the fleet headed for <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. None of the plans were executed because the invasion fleet was struck repeatedly by storms and a major part engaged in a disastrous expedition to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Other books from <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON>'s collection included <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> XIV </ORGANIZATION>'s copy of <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>'s `` Esther,'' a tragedy celebrating the Sun King's generosity, the queen's devotion and religious harmony under his It appealed so much to <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> that he would attend rehearsals and follow the dialogue with his own gold - and leather-bound copy It sold for $ 59,320.

 Excerpts from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address on political reform Tuesday to the Supreme Soviet
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 No, comrades, there are no easy ways. I have had many occasions to say that it is only by combining economic reform with political changes, democratization and glasnost that we can fulfil both the immediate and long-term tasks we have set ourselves.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The principal content of the first stage of the reform is streamlining the structure of soviets, the order of the formation and the activity of the supreme bodies of power and the electoral system. The draft laws submitted for discussion to this session are aimed to achieve precisely that ... The next major stage of political transformation will be linked with the harmonization of relations between the union and its constituent republics.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Separate mention should be made of pronouncements in favor of broader and far-reaching changes in the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. This applies to a radical rewording of the preamble, a new interpretation of socialist pro socialism with democracy and on this basis tapping the entire potential of our social system, we have no right to forget even for one minute that socialist democracy, like any democracy, has nothing in common with lack of discipline, egoism and anarchy.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday the strong opposition to his decision to prevent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from visiting the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> shows widespread insensitivity to the threat of international terrorism. In his first public statement on the subject since his decision to reject <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s request for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa last Saturday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he was sorry but not surprised about the extent of the criticism he has received. Speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony for a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> annex, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the magnitude of the opposition suggested that international terrorism had become a secondary issue for many. `` The basis -LRB- for the decision was -RRB- our concern about terrorism and I am afraid that it's too easy for people to forget what an important problem that is and what a threat it is to civilized society,'' he said. Referring to the presence of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> observer mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the Palestinians will have no difficulty in getting their message across to other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members. `` We have no problem with that,'' he said. Since the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rejection of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visa request, worldwide opposition has been virtually unanimous, ranging from Arab countries to some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s closest allies _ <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. One common argument mentioned by allied spokesmen was that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s decision weakens the hand of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> moderates. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the decision will not impair the peace process and that he will not reconsider it. `` I think it was the right decision. I stick by it,'' he said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, showed little interest in a statement by an adviser to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Sherif </PERSON>, who appeared to go a long way toward meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands concerning the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Among other points, <PERSON> Abu-Sharif </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s position is one of `` full acceptance'' of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and of rejection of the threat or use of terrorism by the Palestinians. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` It sounds to me like one more statement from a Palestinian spokesman. It's always a difficult thing determining what's authoritative and what is n't.'' Outside the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a handful of demonstrators protested the rejection of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visa request. The protesters gathered across the street from the department's main entrance, where they waved <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, pictures of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and signs In a letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahshan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> called `` absurd'' the decision to refuse a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on national security grounds. `` Although we disagree with your decision, we honestly believe that it is never too late to correct it,'' <PERSON> Jahshan </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>.

 Syrian troops arrested nearly 350 pro-Iranian gunmen in unprecedented house-to-house sweeps through <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector, officials said Tuesday. The cleanup operation aimed at quelling bloody clashes that began Thursday between rival Shiite Moslem militiamen and left 40 people dead and 87 wounded, according to police count. Reporters said residents in <LOCATION> Khandak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ghamik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, looked stunned as Syrian soldiers staged a midmorning house-to-house search. Children and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> women, covered from head to ankle in black chador robes, stood back in fright as the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> tramped through their apartments, reporters said. A Syrian source speaking on condition of anonymity said under Syrian sponsorship, <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have worked out a plan to enforce security in the southern slums. It would be carried out soon under Syrian supervision, he said. Last week's violence marked the first time in five months that Syrian-backed Amal and pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen fought in Syrian-controlled districts of the city. The five-day confrontation began after four senior <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> officers escaped a car-bomb assassination attempt in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-patrolled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Talleh </PERSON>, the Syrian officer supervising the house raids, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the arrests started Sunday in a wide-ranging operation to include <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums `` once west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is completely cleaned.'' Most of the 14 foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian Lebanese groups are believed to be kept in the city's southern districts. <PERSON> Talleh </PERSON> said his troops took away three truckloads of Soviet-made assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, ammunition and bullet-proof vests from a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> office. It was shut down and guarded by 120 Syrian troops. Thirty Syrian soldiers were posted at an Amal office where Syrian soldiers confiscated similar weapons, he said. <PERSON> Talleh </PERSON> refused to give a breakdown of arrests or say where the gunmen are being held. But a Lebanese police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said almost all those arrested belong to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> or `` Party of God'' and will be handed over to the Iranian Embassy after questioning. Amal militiamen evacuated areas being searched by Syrian troops and went home, he said. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for `` hope'', said only two militia members were arrested and they were freed Tuesday after a 24-hour detention. A 12,000-strong Syrian peacekeeping force marched into south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 and west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in May 1988 to end fighting like last week's. In May, more than 300 people were killed and another 1,000 wounded in a bloody 19-day confrontation that left <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in control of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Four months later, <PERSON> Amal </PERSON>'s three top commanders were killed in an ambush in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Amal blamed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally in the eight-year gulf war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Syrian control of eastern and northern areas of the country along with south and west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, frequently is challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> faction.

<HEAD>EPA Seeks Public Comment on Banning Auto Use in Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday asked the public to comment on the `` cruel dilemma'' of whether it really is required to shut down <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> auto use to meet clean air standards, as some interpretations of the law seem to require. Such an action would be catastrophic, the agency said. Though framed in terms of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the legal issue could some day be applied to many of the 107 cities and rural counties that do not meet federal air pollution standards. The agency is under court order to promulgate an air pollution control plan for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, by far the dirtiest of the 107 and home to one American in 18. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> fails to meet federal pollution standards for ozone and carbon monoxide, and it is the only area not meeting standards for nitrogen oxides. In recent years, peak ozone concentrations have been almost three times the standard, which typically is exceeded on 145 occasions annually. No other city has peaks more than 75 percent above the standard or more than 35 violations per year. Ozone, which damages the lungs in high concentrations, is formed in sunlight by the reaction of nitrogen oxides, a combustion product, with certain hydrocarbon compounds such as gasoline vapor or solvents. The South Coast Air Quality Management District has estimated that an 80 percent to 90 percent reduction in hydrocarbon emissions, half of which come from transportation fuels, would be needed to meet the ozone standard in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. After several postponements, all cities were supposed to meet the standards by Dec. 31, 1987 _ but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has never been able to decide what happens next. EPA has announced, but not formally adopted, plans generally requiring 3 percent annual reductions in emissions of the relevant pollutants beyond whatever reductions result from federal programs such as new auto standards. Though EPA is involved in several court cases, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is the only area where EPA is under orders to fulfill the legal mandate to impose its own control plan where it has found local plans inadequate. Tuesday's 142-page notice asked what compliance date an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> plan should adopt. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> tried before, in 1973, to order drastic cutbacks in emissions in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but in 1977, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required new control plans to show attainment generally in three years to five years. For <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> now, `` A plan aimed at attaining these standards in five years would have to ban the sale or use of fossil fuels for cars and trucks, airplanes, boats and trains,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement said. Such a plan `` would necessarily prohibit almost all -LRB- hydrocarbon -RRB- emissions from manufacturing activities, and ban all products with -LRB- hydrocarbon -RRB- emissions _ for example paints, waxes, pesticides, auto anti-freeze, cleaning products, lubricants and suntan lotions.'' `` It would be impossible for most people to commute to work and for most forms of commerce to continue. ... It is evident that a short-term -LRB- federal plan -RRB- would have catastrophic consequences'' and could be impossible to enforce, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> clearly preferred the alternative of embracing the ambitious plan now being developed by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> district aimed at compliance by 2007, when unspecified technological advances could make almost all cars in the area powered by electricity. It asked for comment on the feasibility of adopting `` backstop'' federal measures to take effect if particular parts of the state plan fell by the wayside. The agency said it would consider the public comments in conjunction with its judgments on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> plan, expected to be formally submitted to the agency next spring. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> published its dilemma on the same day the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a strongly critical report of the agency's handling of state plans The association said local affiliates examined state plans for nine metropolitan areas _ <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> The affiliates reported significant failure to carry out promised control measures, widespread failure of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to meet deadlines for decisions, lax operation of auto pollution inspections, use of out-of-date data and computer models and frequent double counting of emissions reductions.

<HEAD>Dissidents Demand Chun Be Tried For Corruption</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dissidents called Tuesday for former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to stand trial for corruption and human rights abuses, and they urged other political groups to support demands for a special tribunal. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> was studying plans to purge the government. He was expected to fire as many as 11 ministers linked to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> to try to defuse public anger and present an unsullied administration. Dissident leaders accused the government of a cover up, charging <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and his colleagues were implicated in past abuses associated with <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. `` The Struggle Committee for the Arrest of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>,'' an alliance of dissident groups, announced a meeting Dec. 5 of political parties and social groups to seek special legislation to investigate and try <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. The main opposition parties, which have been calling for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-ja </PERSON>, did not react immediately to the dissidents' call. But top opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> Monday had repeated his resistance to jailing <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> because he said he is against political retribution. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general who took power with military backing in 1980, went into rural exile at a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monastery last week after apologizing to the nation for abuses under his seven-year authoritarian rule. The furor has dominated South Korean politics with opposition groups demanding a full accounting. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has been conducting public hearings into the Chun government and findings have further fueled public anger. Dissidents have little public support because of their extremism, but they have organized a series of large, often violent protests in recent weeks to demand <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s arrest. An alliance statement said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> must face trial for widespread corruption; the deaths and jailings of political opponents; and his role in the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which some 200 people died. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied personal corruption. But some of his relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged with embezzling government funds and other crimes involving millions of dollars. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, another former general and once a close <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> ally, appealed to the nation Saturday for forgiveness for the former president. But dissident and opposition groups responded by demanding a full investigation. In a weekend appeal, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also promised to release as many political prisoners as possible and restore to other government opponents the civil rights of which they were stripped. People facing trial for political protests would have their cases reviewed, he said. Government officials, who declined to be identified, said at least 200 prisoners would be freed by early December. Police said 11 students seized for trying to attack <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s house Oct. 31 were released Tuesday. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> took power February after <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> stepped down. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won presidential elections in December after the opposition split its votes.

<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> residents filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging that a federal judge's desegregation order deprived them of the right to live and work in neighborhoods `` free from low-class people.'' The suit, filed in the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> by the Save <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, was the latest skirmish in an eight-year legal battle that nearly brought the city of 195,000 to financial ruin for defying the judge. The federation comprises 13 citizens' groups opposed to U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>'s order that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> build 1,000 units of low - and middle-income housing scattered throughout the city to remedy decades of segregation The suit, which lists several hundred residents and merchants as petitioners, maintains that the order deprives them of `` the benefits of living and-or working in neighborhoods free from low class people -LRB- of any race -RRB- and the crime and housing rot which nearly always accompanies their presence.'' `` To victimize the innocent because of wrongs by others _ by forcing upon those victims unwanted associations and by otherwise jeopardizing them, their families and their property _ is surely to violate a constitutional sense of justice,'' the suit said. It said the residnets `` have lost value in their property and thus suffered economic injury.'' The group's lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, said the suit utilizes arguments never presented on behalf of the city. Those include what he said were a First Amendment right not to associate with certain people and the Tenth Amendment establishment of federalism and separation of powers. The lawsuit was filed in an appeals court instead of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because it challenges Sand's authority to impose the desegregation plan, said <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>. If the suit succeeds, Sand will have to refashion a remedy, <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. In 1985, five years after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit, Sand found the city liable for 40 years of intentionally segregating its schools and housing. A school desegregation plan went into effect in 1986. Sand later ordered the housing desegregation plan. The City Council defied him in August and was found in contempt, paying out $ 819,000 in fines before capitulating to the threat of financial ruin and agreeing to carry out the plan. Appeals of Sand's ruling have failed. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear the case. Sand had no comment on the suit, according to his chambers. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Save </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization has received donations from all over the country and would take the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if necessary.

<TEXT>
 A senior Soviet officer Tuesday rejected as a `` propaganda ploy'' a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> report saying the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> massively outguns the Western alliance in conventional arms. `` This paper ... is not useful for the purpose of the future talks,'' Col.-Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> told a news conference He referred to planned talks on conventional stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, for which a mandate is being negotiated in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> between the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 28-page report was billed by Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> as an attempt to publicize relative East-West troop strengths and challenge <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to issue its data. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would publish its own figures at an unspecified date after consulting <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> report `` Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: The Facts,'' is not the basis for negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> at the new conventional stability talks. But <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> challenged this. The study focuses on the ground and air forces to be discussed at those talks and ignores naval forces that are not at issue. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> say they hope the talks, which will cover the territory from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, will begin early next year. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> report did not discuss the quality of East bloc weapons and forces, only their numbers. It said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations have a large superiority in 11 major arms systems. In eight of those, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> alone outguns all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies combined, the report said. As a military man, <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said, he failed to understand the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> approach because `` the data provided do not make possible a real assessment of the fighting power of the two alliances.'' He disputed figures on the East bloc's capability and said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> report erred in omitting the two military blocs' naval forces. `` In these areas, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> armed forces hold a multifaceted superiority, including a 3-1 advantage in major combat ships, cruisers, cruise missiles and mine sweepers and a 2.5-1 advantage in naval aircraft,'' <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> paper is a propaganda ploy which can not serve as a basis for future negotiations,'' he said. The talks are expected to replace deadlocked Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks on reducing troops in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Negotiations for a conventional stability mandate have been upset by a dispute between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about whether talks should be limited to the 23 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations, or extended to include <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 12 neutral and non-aligned states. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON>, chief Soviet delegate to the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review conference, told Tuesday's news conference <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is ready to include all its territory to the Urals in the new talks. He also said the Soviets are ready to accept Western suggestions that certain areas of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> be excluded from the talks. The issue of how much Turkish territory to include, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base at <LOCATION> Adana </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, is one of the last major stumbling blocks to <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> agreement on a mandate. Both sides expect the dispute to be resolved.

<HEAD>Opinion Forums Want Defense Spending Cuts, Some Tax Hikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Participants in a series of `` citizens assemblies'' held nationwide overwhelmingly favored cuts in defense spending, and most also supported selected tax hikes and more money for education, a public policy group reported Tuesday. Results of discussions at 13 of the special seminars involving a cross-section of 1,000 people were made public by the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at a news conference Tuesday. The report, `` A Citizens' Agenda for the President,'' was sent to President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week. `` This is something like an X-ray of what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public might think if they really got into it and all the cards were on the table,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgens </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which describes itself as a non-partisan public institute set up to `` make representative democracy work.'' The results, which showed the federal budget deficit as the major concern among participants, were obtained from forums held between Sept. 17 and Nov. 7. Those attending were nearly all at least high school graduates but had a wide variety of backgrounds. About half were Democrats, 30 percent Republicans and the remainder described themselves as independents, <PERSON> Higgens </PERSON> said. He said the center tried to make the groups as representative of all Americans as possible, but included only people who were willing to study 90 pages of objective briefing material and then participate in the day-long forums. <PERSON> Higgens </PERSON> acknowledged that the study could not be considered a scientific survey of public opinion, but organizers believe it accurately reflects the opinions people would have if they bothered to inform themselves on national issues. The assemblies are to meet again in May to assess <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first 100 days in office and draw up a more extensive report for the president. On military spending, 44 percent of participants supported a 3 percent, across-the-board cut and 46 percent supported a 10 percent cut. Among the least popular expenditures were aid to resistance fighters against communist regimes, funds for anti-missile defenses and money to build up of conventional or strategic forces. `` In general, foreign aid and defense programs were ranked at a lower priority than all domestic programs,'' the report said. Seventy percent said foreign aid should be cut; 57 percent wanted cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments to physicians; and 52 percent said agricultural price supports could be reduced. Nearly all other suggested cuts in domestic programs received the support of less than half the participants. To further fight the deficit, 78 percent said tobacco, wine and beer could be taxed at higher rates, while 60 percent advocated a higher top personal income tax bracket of 33 percent, and more than half said they would support higher user fees for government services and gasoline tax hikes. Two-thirds also said business tax deductions could be limited, and more than half advocated a higher top corporate tax bracket. A majority of participants supported new federal spending on education, energy, environmental programs, civilian research and development, welfare reform and drug and crime prevention. Forums were held in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Hickory-Unifour </LOCATION> area and the <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham-Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids-Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Four U.S. Teams To Search For MIAs, Talks Planned Between Sides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> regarding future cooperation in the search for American servicemen missing in action, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The talks would take place following a 10-day joint search by four American and Vietnamese teams that starts Dec. 5, said spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has agreed to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to have four teams conduct the search, an increase from the two teams that were allowed to search various sites twice this year. `` We hope that this will enable us to make more rapid progress in efforts to obtain the fullest possible accounting of those still missing in action,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams will consist of technical personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, he said. They will be investigating a number of cases in the areas of <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoi </PERSON>, south of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. `` We have proposed to the Vietnamese to meet in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> following the conclusion of this activity, Dec. 19 to 21, to conduct technical talks, to review our joint activities to date and our future work program,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We appreciate the increased cooperation of the government of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in these efforts.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> originally agreed to cooperate in the MIA searches for a 90-day period starting Sept. 1. The proposed talks would focus on extending that period. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` hopeful that our joint cooperation will continue for as long as necessary to obtain the fullest possible accounting.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says there are more than 2,400 Americans missing in action from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, most of them in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected demands from the impoverished <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country that cooperation on the MIA issue be linked to the establishment of diplomatic links. But it has allowed American charitable groups to provide prosthetics and medical care for handicapped children. Trade with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is banned by law.

 A construction worker fell three stories and was impaled on a 6-foot steel rod, but that probably saved his life, two doctors said. The heavy rod kept <PERSON> Jakie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> from plunging six more floors to the ground when it pierced his belly and groin, said Drs. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachariah </PERSON>, who treated <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> at the scene Monday. `` The rod basically arrested his fall,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zachariah </PERSON> said that without the rod, <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> `` would have definitely gone over.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> was lucid enough to answer routine questions about his medical history. `` Given the circumstances, he was relatively calm,'' <PERSON> Zachariah </PERSON> said. Firefighters cut the bar of concrete reinforcing rod and, with the rod still imbedded in <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON>'s body, lowered him to the ground in a basket. The rod was removed in surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON>, 50, was in serious condition Tuesday with facial, abdominal and groin injuries following the accident at a parking garage being built by the <ORGANIZATION> Whittenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Witnesses and a <ORGANIZATION> Whittenberg </ORGANIZATION> vice president said <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> was operating a crane from inside a control cab on top of the nine-story building. He was hoisting a half-ton wooden concrete-form panel when a wind gust apparently blew the 8-by-12-foot form into the wooden cab, knocking it and <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> over the edge. `` My first thought was that the crane ... killed the man in the box,'' said <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey </PERSON>, who watched from the nearby Hall of Justice. `` I could see that guy inside as it headed down.'' Still inside the control cab, <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON> fell headfirst 36 feet to the sixth-floor parking deck, which juts out farther than the top three floors. He fell almost vertically onto the steel rod, located within two feet of the garage's edge. The rod passed through some fat on <PERSON> Klaber </PERSON>'s abdomen and part of his groin, said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, director of university's emergency room

<HEAD>Freeways Becoming Deathtrap For Crossing Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Freeways in southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> increasingly are becoming deathtraps for illegal aliens who try to cross them at night on their journey north, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol says. In four years, 56 undocumented aliens have been killed on Interstate 805 and Interstate 5 within four miles of the U.S.-Mexico border when they tried to beat traffic across up to eight lanes, officials said. Ten have died in the last month. More people have been killed on those small stretches of freeway than any comparable road elsewhere in the country, said Capt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Denno </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> office. `` Let's say these were all American motorists that were struck and killed,'' <PERSON> Denno </PERSON> said in an interview published Monday in The Tribune of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` I think the media in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in particular would jump right on this and through the use of tremendous media exposure this would become an issue everyone would jump on. `` Groups would be formed and things would happen. Something would be done.'' But because the victims are not <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, he said, no one has taken the lead in seeking a solution. `` They do n't have any real spokesperson,'' <PERSON> Denno </PERSON> said. `` That's probably why there is no hue and cry to do something about this problem. <PERSON> Denno </PERSON> said he started keeping track of alien pedestrian fatalities on the freeways after becoming commander of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area highway patrol in February 1986. He said he learned there were seven in 1985 and the toll has increased over the years. Smugglers hired to guide aliens often lead a group of 12 or so at a time across a highway. They usually try to cross in single file. `` The first people to cross will look and see that it is reasonably safe for them to cross and they will start running,'' <PERSON> Denno </PERSON> said. `` Usually it is the people at the end of the line that get struck and killed.'' Many illegal aliens also are unfamilar with the speed of American traffic because they come from remote or undeveloped regions, officials said. The drivers involved are almost never cited because the accidents are considered unavoidable, officials said. Several officials from various agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have met informally to discuss the situation. Options that have been discussed include putting up signs to alert drivers that people might be crossing the freeway, reducing the speed limit near the border and installing lights for better roadway illumination. Enforcement of a reduced speed limit would be difficult at best, officials said. Of the warning signs, <PERSON> Denno </PERSON> said, `` That's something that's never been done before, but it is something that will probably be considered down the road. You do n't usually put signs on a freeway to warn motorists of things that are n't supposed to be there in the first place.''

<TEXT>
 A crippled Polish child on Tuesday entered a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital, where she will be treated free of charge for birth defects, thanks to the efforts of a Polish-American woman. Seven-year-old <PERSON> Basia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rduch </PERSON>, who weighs just 20 pounds, flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from her homeland Monday, accompanied by her mother, <PERSON> Daniela </PERSON>, a widowed seamstress from the village of <LOCATION> Godow </LOCATION>. The trip was made possible by the efforts of <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I feel very lucky,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rduch </PERSON> said through a translator. `` I could n't ask for anything more. I have a lot of hope in my heart.'' The youngster was taken Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Shriners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for Crippled Children in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where she will undergo tests for treatment for her birth defects, which include severe curvature of the spine. Her deformity makes it difficult for her to walk and causes digestive problems. After doctors in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> told Mrs. <PERSON> Rduch </PERSON> they could not help her child, she began efforts to get treatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She wrote to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital, but the letter did not have the correct address and was in Polish. She never received a reply. Mrs. <PERSON> Rduch </PERSON> did n't give up hope, however. In August, she gave a copy of that letter to a neighbor, who is Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s cousin. `` My cousin sent me a copy of this letter and just asked me if I could take it up to the hospital,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who speaks Polish and whose parents were born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> did n't stop there. She learned about the Shriners program of providing free care to needy crippled and burned children, and the charity's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital was contacted. Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a purchasing director for <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, also collected $ 3,500 in donations for <LOCATION> Basia </LOCATION>, most of it from Polish-Americans in northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Production Delayed Again At Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant which makes a critical component of nuclear weapons wo n't be able to resume production until at least next spring or summer because of persistent safety concerns, Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON> said Monday. Just last month, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said their <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> C. </LOCATION>, would begin a phased restart of its K reactor in December, and that it could resume production of tritium in January. None of the three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has produced weapons material since last April. `` We are hoping to start -LRB- the K reactor -RRB- in the spring, summer,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not going to start up or operate a reactor that we are not satisfied is totally safe.'' Since October, engineers with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the operating contractor, the E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have been developing much more stringent operating and safety criteria. `` We're not slipping. We are using more caution, OK?'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in the interview. `` I am satisfied with the progress. I think our start-up criteria, our modifications and our upgrade are proceeding well. I do not want to put a predicted date on the start-up,'' said <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. `` As we proceed toward start-up, we want to make sure that everything is right. I do n't want to have an arbitrary date of December and then find out that all of the procedures are not in place. I am now saying spring because I now think that is a reasonable date. It may be that when we get to spring that it wo n't be til summer I do n't see it going much farther than that,'' he said. The three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> are the only operational facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> capable of producing two critical nuclear weapons materials, tritium and plutonium. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` awash'' in plutonium. Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year and administration and congressional sources say stockpiles will be depleted badly within six months to two years, although the exact numbers are classified. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons. Asked when tritium would be in critical short supply, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said: `` I think we are OK with spring and summer,'' but declined to give an exact date. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> listed these new safety measures for <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>: _ Requiring the shift superviser to have an engineering degree Officials at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> say that nine out of the 12 shift supervisers hold degrees, and the gap can be closed by reassigning engineers from other duties. _ Adding more technical support on each shift _ Using a five-shift rotation for key operations workers, one more shift than before, freeing an entire shift for training at any given time This will double the hours each shift spends per year on a computer simulator; _ Completing seismic reviews and modifications necessary to assure the ability of safety systems to shut down the reactor, remove decay heat, and monitor conditions _ <ORGANIZATION> Increase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters oversight and approval of key start-up procedures Both <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are beefing up their management and oversight of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, officials say. For the first time, federal officials will be stationed directly at each reactor rather than at the regional headquarters, which is located at one edge of the sprawling 300-square-mile complex. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to run <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1950 at the personal request of President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, is turning the operating contract over to the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> starting April 1. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> has reassigned the senior official in charge of reactor operations to <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, 500 miles away. When the contract changes hands, the duties of 500 other key engineers who had been in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> will be moved to <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said that beause of the changes, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and other nuclear weapons facilities `` will emerge as a stronger complex.'' He initiated a review of the 17 major weapons facilities shortly after taking office in February 1985, he said, and began a reform campaign shortly thereafter, creating a new post of assistant secretary for safety, health and environment with the power to shut down plants. `` After Three Mile Island -LRB- a partial meltdown of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> utility reactor in March 1979 -RRB-, the commercial nuclear power industry got its act together. But the government procedures, policies, plans did not keep pace,'' he said. `` A legitimate case can be made that some of our reactors ... were being run with a pre-Three Mile Island mentality,'' he said. Tighter oversight and monitoring are needed, he said, `` to bring us up to the level of training and operation that the commerical sector has attained.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> camp survivors are ready to testify against an elderly man alleged to be one of 10 most-wanted war criminals if <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> upholds his extradition to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. West German prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for former SS Capt. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>, accused of killing thousands of people while he was commander of Nazi labor camps in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II. An Argentine judge on Monday ordered that <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>, arrested a year ago in a remote village, be extradited to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shwammberger </PERSON>'s lawyers say they will appeal the extradition order. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>, 76 has been a fugitive since he disappeared from a train in 1948 while being taken from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military authorities in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to be tried, according to renowned Nazi hunter <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON>. Prosecutors allege the former SS commander was responsible for the deaths of more than 5,000 people, mostly Jews. Camp survivors have testified that he shot to death starving prisoners or set dogs on them. `` He was a sadist, an evil person,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Blonder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, who testified at a Argentine deportation hearing in July along with two other survivors of the <LOCATION> Przemysl </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mielec </LOCATION> labor camps. <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Krombacher </PERSON> said witnesses from two continents are expected to testify against <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> if he goes to trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Testimony has been taken from witnesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Krombacher </PERSON> said. `` Many witnesses will be available.'' <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said dozens of labor camp survivors are anxious to recount what they saw <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> do to prisoners. `` These are all first-class witnesses,'' <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. He said the witnesses are living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> had been a member of the Gestapo, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' secret police, in <LOCATION> Innsbruck </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said. The former SS commander was arrested in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> just after the end of the war in 1945 and a large quantity of valuables were confiscated from him, <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- Authorities -RRB- found a large number of rings, gold watches, jewelry and diamonds taken from victims in the labor camps,'' said <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON>, who had been tracking <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> for four decades. The Nazi hunter said he learned in 1971 that <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> was living in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and informed prosecutors in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> was apparently tipped off and fled before Argentine police could arrest him, <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>'s name was on a list of 10 most-wanted <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminals published in 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The list appeared in Argentine newspapers, and authorities were tipped off about <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>'s whereabouts, <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> was arrested on Nov. 13, 1987 in <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>, a village about 500 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Since then, he has been jailed in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of the capital. Argentine officials said they learned <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1949 and worked for a chemical company for many years.

<TEXT>
 Losses in the savings and loan industry shrank by 60 percent in the third quarter, reflecting rescues of insolvent institutions that transferred the red ink to the government's books, a top regulator said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, in a luncheon meeting with reporters, also hinted at his agency's recommendation for reshaping the federal rescue effort <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the nation's 3,028 federally insured <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls lost $ 1.52 billion in the July-September period, down from a revised $ 3.82 billion in the second quarter and $ 3.93 billion in the first three months of the year Earlier this month, bank board economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> predicted third quarter losses would narrow to about $ 2 billion. The second quarter loss had previously been reported at $ 3.6 billion. The industry's earnings from current operations rose from $ 224 million in the second quarter to $ 364 million in the third. Non-operating losses, reflecting mostly write-offs of loans already gone bad, shrank from $ 3.50 billion to $ 1.31 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said operating profits would continue in the fourth quarter, but said the chances of the industry posting an overall profit depended on how many bad loans remain to be written off. A complete report on the industry's performance through Sept. 30 is not due out until Dec. 14. The $ 9.27 billion loss for the first nine months, up from $ 7.8 billion for all of last year, is the industry's worst since the Depression. Wall attributed the partial stemming of the red ink last quarter to the more than 140 closings and forced mergers of failed S & amp; Ls. He said the bank board hopes to have handled 200 by the end of the year. Some analysts and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have criticized the deals because the bank board in many cases agrees to absorb much of the rescued institutions' future losses. They say losses continue to mount, although the losses do n't show up on the industry's books. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the bank board next month will forward to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> its recommendation on how to structure the continued cleanup of the S & amp; L industry. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the proposal being discussed is similar to this year's bailout of the Farm Credit System That provides for taxpayers, through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, to pay the interest on bonds sold to raise bailout money. It also establishes a special board including the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary to oversee expenditure of bailout funds. `` What we have on the agenda is n't far from that,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. He declined to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said the department's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan would not be released for at least several weeks. He said the department still was trying to arrive at a firm estimate of the size of the problem, projected at between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion by various analysts. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures commercial banks, was expected during a speech on Wednesday to present his agency's recommendation for cleaning up S & amp; Ls. On another topic, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he would like to remain as bank board chairman in the next administration but has not yet been approached by aides to President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> called a news conference to say he was awaiting an official report. `` We can not act on the basis of newspaper reports,'' he said. `` The right way is, really, for those who have been assaulted to make out a case.'' Journalist <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> and chauffeur <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> of The Chronicle, published in <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, made formal allegations to police that Matabeleland Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> chased them in his station wagon, seized their car keys and forcibly escorted them to his home Sunday. There, according to their newspaper's report, the governor punched them and threatened to shoot them with a pistol. This occurred after interviewing the governor at his residence about gold mining operations. <PERSON> Dube </PERSON>, unrelated to the governor, escaped from the residence at <LOCATION> Esigodini </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION> while the governor allegedly was beating the driver. <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> was held more than two hours before the governor drove him to a nearby police station and ordered his detention. Police freed <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> five hours later after deciding they had no grounds to hold him. `` I did not try to escape because I feared I would be shot,'' <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> told his paper. Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chingoka </PERSON> broke an official silence on the affair to criticize police officers. He said he would punish Esigodini policemen if they unlawfully detained the driver. <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, owners of The Chronicle and all <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s other daily and Sunday newspapers, condemned what it called brutal, unprovoked and premeditated attacks. `` This is an example of jungle law which <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> should not tolerate from its leaders,'' said group chief executive <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusike </PERSON>. If the governor were not punished, `` <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> may be entering a new frightening era where the rights of ordinary citizens are trampled underfoot willy-nilly by those in authority.'' The Chronicle recently has won popular acclaim for exposing cases of alleged official corruption, including a report charging Gov. <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> illegally grazes cattle on state land. The governor has made no official comment. When he was questioned Sunday by The Chronicle, he reportedly said the reporter was held because he did not have proper identification. Of the driver, who still was being detained at the governor's residence, <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` You can write what you want but I am going to work on this guy.

<HEAD>Teen-Age Suspect In Slaying Found Hanged In Woods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCKLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teen-age suspect in the slaying of a college student was found hanged in the woods Tuesday, a month after his disappearance frightened residents and forced police to curtail Halloween celebrations. The body of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>, 19, was found around 8 a.m. by hunter <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Purrington </PERSON> of <PERSON> Buckland </PERSON> as he stalked two deer in the woods of <LOCATION> Hog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. `` I heard something snap up above,'' <PERSON> Purrington </PERSON> said. `` I looked up and I saw the body. ... I made it down that mountain in record time.'' The spot was about a mile from the road where Branch's car was found Oct. 25, the day a search warrant was issued for his arrest in the stabbing death of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 18. Branch was identified through a wallet found on his body, <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON> said Branch and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> were acquaintances. He called the slaying `` an extremely violent murder involving numerous stab wounds.'' The cause of Branch's death was tentatively ruled a suicide and tests were being conducted to determine how long Branch had been dead, <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON> said. He said the body appeared partially decomposed and he believed the youth had died weeks ago. He declined to speculate on a motive for the slaying or the evidence that had led police to suspect Branch as the killer. `` That is a matter, and will always be a matter, of conjecture,'' <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON> said. `` This chapter of this tragedy is terminated. There are no further suspects, and the case is closed.'' Branch was the subject of intensive searches with dogs and helicopters while rumors terrified the town of 18,000 people in northwestern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The body of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greenfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> freshman, had been discovered Oct. 24 by her twin sister in the bathtub of their <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION> home. As Halloween approached, community nervousness was increased by reports that Branch was a fan of horror movies, particularly the `` Friday the 13th'' series in which the character <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> slashes his victims. At the urging of town officials, <ORGANIZATION> Greenfield </ORGANIZATION> held the traditional trick-or-treating for children a day early and limited it to daylight hours. Concern flared again in early November when a <LOCATION> Buckland </LOCATION> home was burglarized three miles from where Branch's car had been spotted and the only items taken were food, winter clothes ad a knife. Police from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said they received reports of possible sightings of the young man, who had worked as a grocery store clerk. On Nov. 14 and 15, a team from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> met with teen-agers and parents in <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION> and surrounding towns in an attempt to calm fears.

 <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> has launched a $ 10 million campaign to restore health services for mothers and children in war-ravaged areas of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, its director said Tuesday. A major effort would be made to expand existing programs in each country aimed at reducing infant mortality, said <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. `` This is the first action of rebuilding the war-torn areas in which both countries are implicity involved,' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` The fact that children are concerned is a prelude for working together in other areas.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> spoke to reporters after returning from a six-day trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during which he met health ministers and other government officials. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Childrens </ORGANIZATION>' Emergency Fund campaign follows a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire in the war that took effect Aug. 20. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> program was aimed at war-devastated areas of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the first emergency medical supplies _ equipment for midwives and refrigerators for medical supplies and vaccines _ arrived in five provinces in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and seven in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He said he would seek funds to support the campaign from governments and humanitarian associations, and that <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> already have made contributions. The initial $ 1 million that kicked off the health program came from <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> emergency funds, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had cut its death rate by half since 1980, meaning that about 100,000 children have been saved through improved conditions such as health measures involving parents, teachers and officials. A similar program in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has saved 30,000 children, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Hijacker Forced Woman At Gunpoint To Leave Husband Behind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> FRANKFURT </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ A hijacker of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 put a gun to the head of a pregnant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passenger to force her to leave her husband behind with other hostages aboard the commandeered plane, a court heard Tuesday. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> also said the hijackers threatened to kill an American passenger every five minutes. She testified at the trial of confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed in the ordeal and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. Mrs. Toga, 30, was returning from a vacation and was seven months pregnant when the Athens-to-Rome flight was seized. Although she said she was not mistreated, <PERSON> Mrs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said she heard other passengers being beaten. During a stop at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport, the hijackers said they would start killing Americans if the airplane were not refueled. Flight purser <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> `` told me that they were threatening to kill one American passenger every five minutes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said. The plane was refueled and flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. At one point, Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> reassured her that she was safe and gave her fruit to eat. `` I was crying, but <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told me that I had nothing to worry about. He said they were interested only in young American men, but they respected women and children,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits he was one of the hijackers, but denies he killed the diver. Mrs. <PERSON> Toga </PERSON> said the other hijacker _ fugitive <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> _ threatened her with a gun just before she was freed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. `` I was chosen to leave the plane, and at that point I saw my husband. I wanted to stay with my husband, but the other hijacker put the gun to my head and told me to get out,'' she said. Her husband, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, who testified later Tuesday, said: `` I was petrified about what they did to my wife, I did n't know what had happened to her. `` I was just sorry that I probably would never see my child,'' said Toga, 36. Under guidelines set by the court to protect witnesses, the couple was not required to disclose their hometown. At the time of the hijacking they lived in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Before Mrs. Toga's testimony, prosecutors disclosed they had had <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s cell searched for drugs and secret communications he may have received from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> said no drugs were found but some documents were taken from the cell and copied. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and his lawyers said the documents were papers related to the case. They charged the search was illegal and asked that <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> be dropped from the case. Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> made no ruling. The defense attorneys also asked that officials from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks be called to testify. According to the attorneys, they had asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for permission to examine television tapes made during the hijacking but had got no reply. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in January 1987 after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

<TEXT>
 Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, overwhelmingly endorsed Tuesday to continue as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Republican leader for another two years, seems an unlikely water carrier for the new president-elect, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Himself a defeated presidential candidate, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has some of his own ideas on one of the most serious problem facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reducing the federal budget deficit, and the two do n't always coincide. And despite a couple of public attempts to gloss over the wounds from this year's campaign, the hurt from that bruising contest will be slow to heal. `` We are ready to go to work with a new administration,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Tuesday after winning, uncontested, another two-year stint as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader. `` The election is over. He won fair and square.'' Unlike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was born into a wealthy Eastern family, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> clawed his way to the top of politics from a middle-class background in tiny <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Washburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> The class differences have aggravated the two men's rivalry. But both also are pragmatists. With the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now even more firmly in Democratic control than before the election, cooperation and compromise will be the Republicans' only keys to success. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> now will have to forge a working relationship with his new Democratic counterpart, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who was selected as majority leader. Although often partisan and acerbic in his rhetoric, and with a biting wit, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has become best known as a crafter of consensus since he became party leader in 1984. `` Work it out'' has been his motto. With the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> sought where possible to be the administration's policy point man. He did it with particular enthusiasm on issues like judicial appointments and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. But he also was capable of independence, particularly where he deemed it important to protect <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators' political interests. In 1988, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s position on just 68 percent of floor votes, placing him about in the middle of the Republican pack on that measure. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 65, suffered machine gun wounds during World War II combat in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that rendered his right arm useless. The affliction has engendered in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> support for programs to aid the handicapped and the poor. He was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 following service in the House.

 Leftist rebels detonated mines and opened fire on a truck carrying army troops Tuesday, killing four soldiers and wounding eight, relief officials said. The rebels ambushed the truck near the El Angel sugar plantation, about nine miles north of the capital, said <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials, who asked not to be identified.

<TEXT>
 An ex-convict released from prison ahead of schedule because of overcrowding was charged with first-degree murder Tuesday in the deaths of two police officers allegedly shot with their own guns. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Boynton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was ordered held without bond on two murder counts by a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge. Street was arrested early Monday, an hour after police said he disarmed two <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> officers, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boles </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strzalkowski </PERSON>, 34. They were shot in the head and shoulders, over their bulletproof vests. Authorities said Street then stole a patrol car and traded it for another vehicle stolen at gunpoint in neighboring <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> before being caught by sheriff's deputies there. Street had been released from prison only 10 days before the shootings after serving eight years of a 15-year attempted murder sentence for shooting a man outside a bar. He has a 20-page criminal record that includes numerous charges of assaulting police officers. Corrections officials said Street served more time than average for a 15-year sentence because of frequent infractions in prison. But they also said he got out nearly two years earlier than he otherwise would have, because of overcrowing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prisons. `` How could a prison system be so wrong in their profile of this individual?'' asked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Strachan </PERSON>, wife of the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police chief and member of a group calling for harsher penalties for attacks on officers. `` How could a file contain 20 pages of a rap sheet and not tell the probation and parole department that this is n't a standard model citizen?'' In 1980 alone, Street was arrested seven times _ three times on charges of assaulting officers _ while free on bond on the attempted murder charge in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, his record indicates. <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bludworth </PERSON> said more must be done to stop releasing people like him. `` We can not use overcrowding as an excuse to continually release dangerous people that will commit crimes against our innocent citizens,'' said <PERSON> Bludworth </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> refuses to blame corrections officials for his officers' deaths. `` I'm sure they did not know when he was released from prison that he was violent,'' he said. So far this year, five <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officers have been shot to death, four of them in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, counting the two officers slain Monday.

<HEAD>FBI, Hispanics Recommend Ways To Assess Damages in Discrimination
Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is proposing to hire Spanish-speaking linguists and to bolster its equal employment opportunity office as part of a damages package for Hispanic agents who won a racial discrimination suit against the agency. The 311 Hispanic agents who sued are being asked to respond to the proposals by Dec. 15. The damages must be approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucias </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. In papers filed Monday with <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>, the Hispanic agents asked the court to assess damages according to a formula they devised, while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> asked they be considered on a case-by-case basis. In a Sept. 30 decision, <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> supported Hispanic agents' contention that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had discriminated against them in job conditions, assignments and promotions <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> suggested then that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> pay court costs, pay Spanish-speaking agents more for the specialized work they do, and improve the promotion system and the equal employment opportunity process in which discrimination complaints are made. Under the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal, agency equal employment opportunity counselors would receive better training and the office would be supervised by an executive assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also promised to hire at least 30 Spanish-speaking linguists to monitor wiretaps and to pay agents bonuses for improving foreign-language fluency. The Hispanic agents had complained they were unfairly burdened with undesirable wiretaps and dangerous assignments because of their appearance and Spanish-speaking ability. They contended that non-Hispanic agents who spoke Spanish were given better assignments. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also said back pay might be due some agents, and proposed having plaintiffs fill out a long forms to determine whether they should receive back pay and how much. But the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, said such a process would require separate hearings on each plaintiff. They proposed a formula to determine how much pay each plaintiff gets, based on tenure, employment status and salary. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> set the Dec. 15 deadline for the plaintiffs to reply. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has until Dec. 30 to counter that response. The class-action lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> `` Mat'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the second-in-command in the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> office and at the time the highest-ranking Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent.

Giant pandas are an endangered species, and zoos worldwide are working to try and save them by encouraging reproduction. About 800 pandas are believed to exist worldwide. Officials at the Mexican zoo plan to pair <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> with 6-year-old Tohui. The <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Zoo agreed to apply all excess revenue from <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION>'s visit toward the cost of new quarters built for him at the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> zoo. Any money left over then will go to a panda conservation fund to be administered jointly by the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> zoos. <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON>'s visit produced about $ 200,000 in revenue, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Zoo officials said. Zoo officials said they have not worked out all of the money allocation and are uncertain whether money will be left over for the conservation fund.

<HEAD>Group Sues FBI To Seal Files From Anti-Terrorism Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An organization opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, seeking to seal files compiled during the bureau's anti-terrorism probe of the private group The class-action lawsuit alleges that during the March 1983-June 1985 probe, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spread false information about the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>, linking it to terrorism and hurting its efforts to raise money and enroll new members. The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeks an order preventing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from using records gathered during the probe and requiring the bureau to seal the files and deposit them in the National Archives. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told the group in a letter two weeks ago that the bureau would consider expunging the records of individuals who believe they are named in the investigation and who request such action. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>, a lawyer at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> which helped <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> file the suit, said the group is willing to continue discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on the matter while the suit is pending. The bureau, following a review by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, ended the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation after failing to establish any substantial link between <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> and international terrorism. Sessions said in September that the probe had been too broad and he disciplined half a dozen <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> personnel for mishandling it. `` Director Sessions explained the investigation by saying that it was an aberration,'' said <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>. `` How can an investigation of such massive scope be an aberration? It was the work of scores of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices around the country.'' The suit alleges that the names of hundreds of people involved with <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> or other groups investigated in 178 spinoff investigations are contained in several government computer databanks, including the Terrorist Information System. Many of the names also have been disseminated to military intelligence agencies as well as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the suit said. One of the plaintiffs, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Xavier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said she is concerned she will have difficulties in her teaching career because her name is in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files from the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe. Ms. <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> said she may be saddled with the unfounded and unfair stigma of `` who would hire a terrorist?'' She and her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Knitter </PERSON>, who teaches theology at <LOCATION> Xavier </LOCATION>, have traveled to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and oppose the administration's Central American policies, but they are not <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members. Ms. <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> said a colleague of her husband's told her that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had visited him at Xavier in May 1987, two years after the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe ended, and wanted to know about <PERSON> Knitter </PERSON>'s reputation on campus and what he was teaching. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> Lent of the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> national office said the group has gotten letters from contributors saying they would no longer donate money to the group because they were afraid their names would turn up in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files. Some private organizations `` have said they had concerns about working with us because of the fact we were under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation,'' said Lent. The suit said that although the investigation ended in 1985, information supporting the probe's validity was disseminated during a February 1988 appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>. The suit also said a newspaper article last June quoted Sessions as saying there had been a sufficient basis for the probe. In September, however, after an internal <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> review of how the probe was conducted, Sessions said the basis for the probe was information provided by an informant who proved to be unreliable.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s call for a `` Common European Home'' shared by the East and West is merely an attempt to preserve Soviet dominance over <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser said Tuesday. In a speech prepared for a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should be praised for seeking reform in his country. But at the same time, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, noting the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> in 1989, said this is no time for the West to let down its guard. As an example, he cited what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had proposed as a new structure in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which `` all nations _ East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ can live in peace and harmony.'' `` The Soviets assure us that there would be room in this house for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as well,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` We appreciate the assurance. But we did not ask for it, nor do we need it. We are in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, not at the invitation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but in alliance with our Western allies.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who likely will be returning to full-time duty in the Army when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends Jan. 20, asked his audience to consider what lies behind the Soviet call for a `` Common European Home.'' `` As I see it, it is an attempt to tie the future to the past, to freeze the ... European status quo,'' he said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> acknowledged that his conclusion `` may seem odd,'' given the Soviet pronouncements about a new era of political thinking, embraced in such terms of `` glasnost'' and `` perestroika.'' But <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he believes, nevertheless, that the Soviet proposal `` is an idea wedded to the past.'' `` Forty years after the Soviets imposed their presence in the middle of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` the citizens of these countries still look to the West as their historical, cultural and political homeland. Their ferment today is a testament to the strength and durability of these aspirations.'' He also said the Soviets have `` rushed to construct a new home for all of us'' because the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have, at last, moved `` to construct a European pillar'' of strength, challenging the Soviet goal of predominant power on the continent. `` If we analyze what this Soviet-built home would contain,'' he said, `` we find some very old ideas indeed _ unbalanced disarmament proposals, dissolution of military alliances, removal of foreign bases and acceptance _ yes, acceptance _ of the ideological division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> presently enforced by Soviet power.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, first drew the nation's attention when he looked Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the eye and told him he had no monopoly on loyalty. `` Please remember ... that it is possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to the Contras, and still love God, and still love this country, just as much as you do,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told the fervent <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer at the nationally televised Iran-Contra hearings. Although that moment represented something of a national debut for the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat, he had already made himself a hero among fellow party members. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, helped engineer the 1986 comeback that saw Democrats regain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which they had lost in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 landslide. His reward: instant clout on the Democratic side of the aisle and appointment as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy president pro tempore, an unexciting post but an important measure of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues. Now, after an intensive backroom campaign launched after Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, announced last April he would step aside as majority leader, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has defeated two more senior colleagues to take the The losers were Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, D-Hawaii and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s elevation to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s top leadership post gives him control of the chamber's agenda as the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> begins its work and as President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> launches his administration. It marks a new begining after <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s long tenure as party leader, and many <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats hope <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> can use it to project a positive, forward-looking image for their party in the wake of three successive defeats for the presidency. He has vowed to share his authority with colleagues saying, `` I do not intend to be a one-man band.'' Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he told his colleagues inside the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has the ability to create an atmosphere of `` calm statesmanship that reaches beyond the prejudices of regionalism ... the ability to achieve a truly national consensus on policies that reject the easy answers. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 55, who has been active in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Democratic politics since 1968, is a protege of Sen. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, whom he served as administrative assistant in the early 1960s. After a number of political setbacks, including defeat in a bid for governor in 1974, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>'s backing, was appointed first as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, then as a federal district judge, a lifetime appointment. In 1980, when <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to become secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, he recommended to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Democratic governor that he appoint <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to fill the vacancy. Two years later, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> won the seat in his own right by a commanding 61 percent of the vote. He won a second term this year by an even more impressive 81 percent. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> compiled a largely liberal voting record and became a champion of the environment, especially in the battle against acid rain, and was an early and outspoken critic of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration environmental policies. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s health panel he is an advocate for a major long-term health care plan. On the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> backed successful 1984 legislation to help <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans cope with diseases believed to be caused by exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. As a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was a steady, quiet, lawyerlike questioner. But as the hearings went on he became an increasingly outspoken critic of those inside the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, who, he said, had subverted the authority of the president and the Constitution by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and arranging for the diversion of part of the proceeds to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s anti-leftist Contra rebels. In his address to <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the public watching on television, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> invoked the memory of his immigrant mother and laborer father and the emotions he said he felt when, as a federal judge, he conferred citizenship on immigrants. He told <PERSON> North </PERSON> that when he asked new immigrants why they wished to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, many of them said the reason was that `` in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> you can criticize the government without looking over your shoulder.'' That's what democracy is all about, the senator said. `` The freedom to disagree with the government.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s father was a utility company laborer who later worked as a janitor. His mother, an immigrant from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, worked at a wool mill in <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where the family lived. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who plays skillful cribbage and competitive tennis, is a 1954 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and earned a law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1960. He was divorced last year after 27 years of marriage. His daughter, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>, is a social worker who lives in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations reported a slight 0.2 percent increase in profits in the July-September quarter after posting a large gain in the previous three-month period, the government said Tuesday.

Corporate profits before taxes were up 0.6 percent in the third quarter to $ 307.7 billion, following a 6.9 percent increase in the previous three-month period.

 The pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed Aug. 31, killing 14 people, testified Tuesday that some rules might have been bent in readying the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 for takeoff but that preparations were adequate. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> admitted seeming deviations from the rules under questioning by aerospace engineer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorney </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> opened an inquiry into the crash on takeoff at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Ninety-four people survived. For instance, the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> veteran of 23 years said he had used hand signals instead of calling out completion of each item on the pre-flight checklist and had made a takeoff briefing at the gate instead of on the runway. `` I like to get as much done as possible before we get into the position of getting rushed,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorney </PERSON> also said a flight attendant was allowed into the cockpit when the jet was waiting to take off, despite an <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rule requiring a `` sterile'' cockpit once the plane has left the gate. But he noted that the plane was `` waiting in a line of traffic'' and added: `` I do n't believe it was a critical phase of flight, but technically it was -LRB- in violation -RRB-.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requires pilots to go through a checklist but does not specifically require a verbal a `` challenge and response'' between pilots. The agency, however, has made clear on many occasions that such an exchange is preferable. According to <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> documents, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> procedures Aug. 31 only suggested a verbal exchange during some phases of the checklist. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> recently chastised <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> for inadequate cockpit discipline and poor coordination and communications among pilots, and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has said that it will formalize the checklist process with increased emphasis on verbal challenges. Delta procedures say the pre-flight briefing should take place `` before takeoff'' but also says it could begin during the `` before start check'' which normally occurs about five minutes before the plane pushes back from the gate. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> testified that he went to full power as soon as he felt engine `` compressor stalls'' unlike any he had ever felt before. `` It was like driving a car 60 mph down the highway and driving into a water puddle. It was pronounced deceleration,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> he said under questioning from a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>, manufacturer of the airplane's engines. Investigators have ruled out mechanical failure as a cause of the stalls, and have focused instead on the position of the wing flaps, which the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said were found retracted instead of extended for takeoff in the wreckage. The wing flap lever in the cockpit was in the wrong position after the crash, the board said. But in the cockpit recording, the co-pilot can be heard saying `` 15, 15, green light'' before takeoff to verify the flaps' proper deployment. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Tuesday he did not know if the other crew members might have touched the flap handle as the plane was in trouble. `` I was too busy flying the plane. I would n't have seen it,'' he said. A pilots union contends a `` split flap configuration'' may have occurred, placing one flap up and one down. The union contends that in that case, the takeoff warning system of the 727 would not necessarily alert the crew of the danger. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> of making a premature finding of pilot error. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, listening to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' testimony, said it is standard for pilots with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' experience to deviate slightly from procedures `` There are reams and reams of manuals and regulations. It would be impossible to remember them all,'' <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> said. Fourteen of the 108 people on board died. The three-man flight crew was among the survivors. `` It's fortunate the crew is alive. That's not always the case. We're very hopeful the crew will be able to provide assistance where in other crashes there's no -LRB- surviving -RRB- crew,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said before the hearing.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> forged ahead Tuesday with the countdown for the secret mission of space shuttle Atlantis despite a forecast for unacceptably high wind and rain showers at launch time. Because of the forecast for Thursday morning liftoff, shuttle managers said they would meet again Wednesday for a more up-to-date look at the situation. The five astronauts on Atlantis are to release a huge spy satellite in orbit. Otherwise, said the top level <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, `` preparations for launch are going very well.'' The managers said in a statement they were n't concerned by one lingering problem: a leaking tire on the shuttle's main landing gear. The leak rate was 1.7 pounds per square inch a day on a tire that on Tuesday held 333 pounds. The agency said at that rate the pressure would remain high enough for a week more on the launch pad. The tire must have at least 275 psi when the spacecraft lands at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Technicians ca n't reach the tire, which is filled with gaseous nitrogen, while the landing gear doors are closed. A refill would require rolling the shuttle back to its hangar and separating it from the external fuel tank, a process that would take weeks. The upcoming launch is being treated with as much secrecy as possible and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has said only that it is scheduled for Thursday between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST. The precise time will be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff. The big countdown clocks at the site were kept blank. Despite the hushed atmosphere, much is known about Atlantis' mission The astronauts will release a $ 500 million satellite _ the first of a series called Lacrosse _ that can discern targets of military interest in 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Once they have released the satellite, dropping it overboard using the shuttle's robot crane, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will hover nearby to make sure everything works. If it does n't, the astronauts will retrieve the Lacrosse and bring it back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said there was a 70 percent probability that the weather will be below the strict limits laid down since the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986, that claimed seven lives. Those rules include winds of less than 19 mph from the south or 28 mph from any direction, no rain at the pad or in the flight path and no thunderstorms within five miles. The forecast was for winds of 15 to 28 mph, three layers of clouds and isolated showers. The flight will be the third shuttle mission dedicated to the military and the second flight since the Challenger disaster. No details will be released during the flight unless something goes wrong with the spacecraft. The other all-military flights were in 1985. The crew will be <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, spaceship commander; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, pilot; and mission specialists Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt.

All five astronauts then were given medical examinations.

<HEAD>Conable Denounces Barriers to Third World Goods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> on Tuesday denounced trade barriers that prevent Third World nations from selling their goods in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said aid to Third World countries was only half as much as they could earn if they were permitted to sell their goods freely to the donor countries. `` If you were to eliminate all international aid and all trade-distorting obstacles, you would have twice as a good a situation in terms of resource transfers for the developing world as you've got now,'' he said. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> estimated the annual value of aid from all industrial countries at $ 35 billion a year, while their trade barriers prevented exports to them worth $ 60 billion. That was only the primary effect of the barriers, because additional trade would stimulate Third World growth, he added. `` The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries alone have lost three quarters _ over $ 250 million worth _ of their annual sugar exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` In 1987 the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imposed anti-dumping actions on carnations -LRB- to limit imports -RRB- from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. All four exported only $ 16 million worth of cut flowers to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>; during that same year they paid almost 150 times that amount in interest to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial creditors,'' he in a statement he will submit next week in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to a meeting of cabinet members of nearly 100 governments. The session will review progress toward dismantling trade barriers. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> distributed blame widely. He noted that West European countries became the world's biggest exporters of beef and wheat while the share of the market supplied by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, two of the lowest cost producers, dropped sharply. He said the high price paid for rice to Japanese farmers, five times the world level, closed off sales by <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Third World's $ 1.2 trillion debt is not up for discussion in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said it clearly is related to trade since whatever may be done about debt, the <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> will need to sell more goods. Three years ago, then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> proposed additional lending to Third World countries to help them grow out of their problems. Little additional lending has been forthcoming. More recently, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, whom President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has tapped as his secretary of state, has been promoting a `` menu of options'' under which debt may be reduced by agreement between creditor banks and debtor governments. `` You're getting an evolution of the so-called <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan,'' <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the biggest source of international aid. The bank, owned by 151 countries, lends the Third World about $ 20 billion a year.

 An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.W </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> that some of the Cubans were afraid to go home because they did not know how they would be treated by <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to fly the 13 back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to support their request for a preliminary order blocking the deportation. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION> that they would be deported within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> it would not send them home until their attorneys had a chance to study their files. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, attorney for 13 of the 15, told <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> that they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym and to due process. `` In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Lauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillppu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said that the Cubans' only claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He said the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> already had rejected that argument. <PERSON> Fillppu </PERSON> questioned what he called `` a last-minute tactic'' by the Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence.

<HEAD>Mexico's New President: Tough and Flexible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has proved himself tough and flexible, necessary qualities for dealing with the economic crisis and growing political opposition he will face after becoming president on Thursday. He is an economist with no experience in elective office, and at 40 will be <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s youngest president in half a century. That may be fitting, since more than half the nation's 84 million people are under 16. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also has a disadvantage none of his predecessors has experienced: serious division within the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929. In addition to being the youngest president in decades, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also is one of the best educated. He has two master's degrees and a doctorate in public administration, all from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, and speaks fluent English and French. The new president is short, trim and bald, dresses smartly and has a full black mustache that enhances an expression of half-puzzled wistfulness that often appears on his face. Friends who know him well, including political writer <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajous </PERSON>, say the genial, shy exterior hides a man of considerable ability and political savvy. As evidence, they offer the fact that he won the presidential nomination from a half-dozen older <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> rivals. As budget secretary under <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, the outgoing president, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> revealed himself as a deft political infighter, excellent organizer and stickler for efficiency. `` He is very fast mentally,'' <PERSON> Lajous </PERSON> wrote recently. `` He plucks ideas out of thin air. His thinking is very sophisticated ... and it's a pleasure to watch him sparring.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is known as a demanding boss who expects things to run on time _ what Mexicans call `` American time'' rather than the less precise `` Mexican time.'' So greatly does the new president admire Japanese discipline that he sends his children to a school run by Japanese. He was born April 3, 1948, in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but his family is from <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION>, a northern industrial state. He married <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Occelli </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> in 1972, seven years after they met at a dance, and they have three children: <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON>, 14; <PERSON> Emiliano </PERSON> 12, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristobal </PERSON>, 9. A keen sportsman, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was a member of the Mexican riding association and the national equestrian team, winning a silver medal at the 1971 Pan American Games. He keeps fit by running and playing tennis and is an ardent soccer fan. Like his most recent predecessors, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> rose through the ranks of the bureaucracy as a loyal <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> member. He comes from an old family of seasoned <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> politicians that settled in the small town of <LOCATION> Agualeguas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> in the 18th century, and joined the party at age 18. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, his father, has served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and as commerce secretary. His mother, <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvajal </PERSON>, is an economist and was active in party politics for many years. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s president is limited to a single six-year term and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> faces problems that would have given some of his predecessors nightmares. An economic crisis has impoverished <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since the bottom fell out of world oil prices in 1982. Enormous grass-roots support that kept the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> in power for two generations has diminished and the spendthrift days of the oil boom are gone. Payments on the $ 102 billion foreign debt have sapped development and prompted complaints the country's efforts to develop industry and increase exports serve only to pay Wall Street bankers. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won narrowly in an election July 6 that was tainted by charges of fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> won only 260 seats in the 500-seat <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, compared with its customary 70 percent or more. The wishes of his predecessors often amounted to orders, but <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> will have to negotiate and compromise with opposition leaders who want to use public disaffection with the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> as a springboard for the 1994 election. Political analysts say the results last election's results indicate people are weary of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s high-handed ways and want a change. At a recent rally, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said the `` one-party'' era is over and the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> must learn to hustle for votes, but there were more charges of fraud in recent state elections. In speeches and interviews, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has said he will `` modernize'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, paring down the bureaucracy, getting rid of state-owned companies that lose money, fighting corruption, balancing the budget, reducing inflation, forcing export industries to become more efficient and reforming the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>.

 THE ECONOMY Crude oil exports are the heart of the economy, but non-petroleum exports are growing rapidly. Sharply lower oil prices caused an economic crisis and the standard of living has been cut in half since 1982. Payments on the $ 102 billion foreign debt take money from development, a major problem for a nation that must create 1 million jobs a year just to keep up with population growth. The economy is a mixture of private enterprise and the government, which runs many industries, including oil through the monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' fourth biggest trading partner; the two-way exchange in 1987 was $ 35.1 billion. Inflation reached 159.2 percent in 1987 but has been reduced to less than 1 percent a month. The daily minimum wage is $ 3.50.

<HEAD>States Should Move Quickly To Close Insolvent Insurers, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State regulators should move more quickly to liquidate insolvent insurers to minimize public harm and avoid costly failures similar to those that have hit the savings and loan industry, an insurance group recommended Tuesday. `` What we need today is a new determination by the regulators to act swiftly,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokers </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the real world, there are significant pressures which encourage regulatory delay rather than fast action against insolvent underwriters,'' <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> news conference. But `` the consequences for policyholders, regulators and insurers are far more severe than they would be if regulators acted quickly,'' he said. The study, `` Managing Insurer Insolvency,'' was prepared by <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> NAIB </ORGANIZATION>. The association represents 58 international, regional and local firms that write more than 75 percent of the property-casualty insurance policies for business and industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Many years ago, the mission -LRB- of regulation -RRB- was to prevent insolvencies. It was achieved by government support for cartel pricing which covered the costs of the weak,'' the study said. `` Keeping weak insurers afloat was an accepted cost of the cartel system.'' But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, one of the study's authors and the former superintendent of insurance of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, contended that `` insolvency is a result of regulation.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said regulators operating on principles from the industry's `` cartel legacy'' too often focus on heroic rescues of insolvent insurers acting `` as a doctor who needs to keep the patient alive'' instead of allowing failing companies to go under. `` This wo n't get at the guts of the problem ... taking an insurance company out of the marketplace before it does something awful to save itself,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a co-author of the study, said changing liability rules, catastrophic coverage, insurance of the most risky situations and events and increased competition also were contributing to the worsening insurer insolvency problem. There have been about 58 property-casualty insurer insolvencies since 1983 according to the <ORGANIZATION> NAIB </ORGANIZATION>. Citing a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation begun this fall into the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ which is estimated to cost $ 1.5 billion _ <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> warned that investigations of other failed insurers will continue next year. `` There appears to be growing concern among federal policymakers that the insurance insolvency problem could parallel the savings and loan insolvency problem if regulatory policies remain unchanged,'' <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. `` There are disturbing similarities in the insurance industry and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, where fraud and mismanagement resulted in the collapse of the system,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesson </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee overseeing the insurance insolvency investigations. <PERSON> Chesson </PERSON> said Mission's insolvency and two others the committee is investigating, <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, represent `` the three largest failures ever in the history of insurance.''

 The hard-fought contest for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, marked by months of cajoling, concluded Tuesday in an aura of eloquence and cordiality. Maybe it was the hallowed walls of the Old Senate Chamber, used officially from 1810 to 1859, and still employed occasionally for secret meetings like this. Sens. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> sat together and chatted as they awaited the opening gavel of the third competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the vice presidential nominee, won a standing ovation from his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues and praise from nearly every speaker. And when the first ballot for majority leader put <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> one short of the 28 he needed to win, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> rose to their feet as one to call for a <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> victory by acclamation. `` It was extraordinarily cordial,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` There was not one instance of rancor or disconsonance `` There was no tension at all,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. `` There were some extraordinarily good talks,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga Seven people spoke on behalf of the three majority leader contenders _ two for <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, two for <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> and three for <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. `` I, of course, was the shortest,'' quipped <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> partisan. Outside the chamber, a handful of security officers were charged with keeping order among crowds of reporters, photographers and lobbyists stationed at the imposing mahogany <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clock </LOCATION>, presented by the state when it became a state. The eagle-topped clock ticked on for more than two hours, and a grinning <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> finally emerged, flanked by his vanquished rivals and the rest of the Democratic leadership. Later, surrounded by reporters in his office, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> took a series of congratulatory phone calls from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. In a jovial conversation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told him `` it is a welcome sign of your good judgment that you have chosen to live in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> even though you did n't have the good fortune to be born there.'' On a more serious note, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` I want very much to work with you. We've got serious problems and challenges and we want to deal with them in cooperation with you.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kansas, re-elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader on Tuesday, said he would be able to work well with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra case on Tuesday upheld two of the central charges against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> but dismissed the third as a `` purely cumulative count'' that would only confuse jurors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> refused to dismiss the two charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of government property against the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide that arose from the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. `` The indictment clearly alleges a conspiracy which involved concealing the very existence of the profits of the enterprise from the start and hiding from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> information relating to the conspirators' assistance for the Contras,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` Its purpose depended on deceit from the start, and acts of concealment were actually part of the commission of the substantive crime,'' the judge said of North's contention the conspiracy count was invalid because it alleged more than one criminal conspiracy. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed a wire fraud charge, saying it `` is, in many ways, a cumulative count'' that would only create `` substantial confusion in the minds of the jurors.'' All three charges also were filed against <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s co-defendants: former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s dismissal of the wire fraud count suggests that charge may also be dropped against the other defendants, who are scheduled to be tried separately. The judge refused to dismiss six charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to congressional committees that investigated whether he and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff were covertly providing military aid to the Contras in violation of the law. So far, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ruled on 34 of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s 37 pre-trial motions. He has dismissed only two of the 16 original counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, including a charge that the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel obstructed an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of the installation of a security fence around his <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> home. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> consented to dismissal of that charge. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has yet to rule on three pending defense motions to dismiss on other legal ground two charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The judge rejected as `` misplaced'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s argument that the <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendments </ORGANIZATION> passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banning direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras were unconstitutional and did not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> expressed doubt about whether the amendments prohibited the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> from aiding the Contras, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> noted that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the provisions into law and agreed to comply with them. North's `` understanding as to the constitutionality of <LOCATION> Boland </LOCATION> in no way affords an excuse for his alleged misconduct or entitled him to obstruct the way the government was, in fact, functioning,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. In a related ruling on charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> falsely assured congressional committees he was complying with the Boland Amendment, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> noted that only the president, not <PERSON> North </PERSON> or other White House staffers, could `` assert executive privilege'' and refuse to answer <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' questions about foreign affairs. `` Deliberate falsifications are another matter, and <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not himself have executive privilege,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` North did not simply refuse to answer; he affirmatively deceived <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and there is not the slightest suggestion in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s papers that the president instructed <PERSON> North </PERSON> to give false information,'' he said. As he did several weeks ago, the judge chided North for offering a `` disdainful view of government'' by arguing he had a right to lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The thought that any one of the hundreds or thousands of persons working for the president can affirmatively and intentionally mislead <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it weeks information ... is unacceptable on its face,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` North seems to state that executive branch officials and their staffs habitually and properly lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the judge said. He refused to delete from the indictment allegations that <PERSON> North </PERSON> violated the Boland Amendment and two executive orders that prohibited government agencies, except the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, from engaging in covert operations without a presidential finding. In doing so, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s contention that the major conspiracy count could not be tried in court because it involved foreign policy questions that a court could not consider. `` The president's conduct in implementing his foreign policy or intelligence functions is not being brought under scrutiny,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` Rather, it is what he did and authorized or did n't authorize that controls the outcome'' of the case. The Boland Amendment is named for its author, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, D-Mass. In a separate ruling Tuesday, the judge refused to exclude <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and his associates from closed hearings set to begin Wednesday on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s objections to editing 350 classified documents the prosecution wants to use as evidence. He said that excluding prosecutors `` would alter the purpose of the hearing and result in further and wholly unnecessary delay'' of the trial, which he previously indicated may start in late January. North's lawyers had not given a reason for seeking to bar <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and his associates from the hearing. But they would likely have argued that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> would get an unfair look at defense strategy by attending the proceedings. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> last week ordered the closed proceedings to consider <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s objections to deleting references to countries, foreign officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operatives from classified documents <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to use as evidence. The judge directed North to explain during the hearings why the material he does n't want deleted from the documents would help him defend charges of diverting more than $ 12 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. North has objected to virtually every deletion proposed by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from the 350 documents, which cover 1,000 to 2,000 pages. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has received government permission to use the documents as exhibits in a public trial as long as the sensitive information is deleted. The prosecution contends that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s objections and his proposal to disclose 40,000 additional pages of secret government documents is merely an attempt to provoke dismissal of the case.

<HEAD>FDA OKs Blood Test Kits for Virus Linked With Rare Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved three tests for a blood-borne virus linked to a rare form of leukemia and recommended that blood banks begin screening for it. The development has been expected for some time and blood banks have started preliminary planning to test for HTLV-I, short for human T-lymphotropic virus type I. The disease, called adult T-cell lymphoma, may appear in a small number of people 20 years to 40 years after they become infected with the virus, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> study has suggested that about two of every 10,000 blood donors carry the virus. However, scientists believe only about 1 percent of those infected develop the disease. By contrast, HIV _ the virus that causes AIDS _ acts much more quickly, sometimes leading to full-stage disease in two or three years. Moreover, researchers increasingly are concerned that a very high percentage of those infected with the virus, perhaps nearly all, eventually will devlop AIDS. All donated blood is already tested for AIDS and several other diseases, including two types of hepatitis. In addition to the rare leukemia, HTLV-I also is associated with an even more rare degenerative neurologic disease called tropical spastic paraparesis. `` Based on current data we know that HTLV-I is rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but to be on the safe side, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has recommended blood screening,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` If blood tests positive, it will not be entered into the blood supply.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> technically is only recommending screening for HTLV-I for the time being, that recommendation has great weight since the agency has the regulatory authority to require such testing if blood banks do not act on their own. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> already has announced it will begin screening blood donations for HTLV-I when the test kits became available for widespread use. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Horrell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 8,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday his group is awaiting expected guidelines from the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> on recommended testing procedures. While the association has not taken a formal position, it already has distributed tentative guidelines to its members, and, <PERSON> Horrell </PERSON> said, `` My sense is there will be testing.'' He said it was difficult to predict how soon testing will be instituted nationwide. Three groups licensed to produce test kits are E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, in collaboration with <ORGANIZATION> Biotech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; and Cellular Products of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziak </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, said the company `` will be shipping product tomorrow'' and that the three companies licensed to market the test can easily meet demand. However, it is likely to be a month or so before test kids will reach every blood bank in the nation. The new test is expected to be a little more expensive than the main AIDS screening test, which averages about $ 1.50 per kit.

 The immediate sequence of events leading to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal of a visa to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> began Nov. 15 in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, when the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> declared an independent state. They also issued a political statement widely interpreted as an implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism, which would represent a significant move toward moderation by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> did not specifically recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, it accepted three <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that do so. It did not say directly that terrorism would be abandoned, but committed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to the `` <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> declaration'' of 1985, which limits attacks to `` military targets'' in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied territories. Military targets are not defined further. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> described it all as `` double talk'' that contained neither recognition nor a renunciation of terrorism. A nearly year-old rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which has cost the lives of more than than 300 Palestinians, provided the impetus for declaring an independent state. After the independence declaration and political statement were issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the next move toward <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace was up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has made recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism conditions for dealing tth the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the Palestinian statement contained `` positive elements'' but rejected the declaration of independence. It said the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> must be determined by negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which captured them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. Major sources of confusion about what the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> said in the political declaration are its vague construction and the fact that it was issued only in Arabic. It says a `` comprehensive political settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict'' must be reached in a framework that includes `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolultions _ the last of which were <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolutions 605, 607 an 608,'' which denounce Israeli deportation of Palestinians from the occupied territories. As a category, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions include the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s equating of Zionism with racism The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also called for an international peace conference `` on the basis of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338,'' thus implicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Resolution 242, passed in 1967, calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from occupied territories in return for from territories occupied in the recent conflict in return for the `` right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.'' Resolution 338 provides for implementation of 242. In its declaration of independence, the council cited <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 181 of 1947, which provides for separate Arab and Jewish states in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Many Arab and Islamic nations recognized the new <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the first days after it was declared, and Third World nations began to join the list. Western European governments generally approved what they described as the more moderate Palestinian position, but did not grant diplomatic recognition. Protests and strikes in increased among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. The Israeli army imposed curfews and other restrictions in an attempt curb celebrations of the independence declaration. On Nov. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> political declaration fell short of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Two days later, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recognized the proclamation of an independent Palestinian state in a careful announcement that said full diplomatic ties were not included. When asked whether that amounted to recognition, the deputy foreign minister replied, `` In essence.'' The statement appeared to be an attempt to express continued support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> without alienating <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has become more cordial recently. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nation to sign a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, recognized the new state on Nov. 20. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also extended recognition on that day. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said on Nov. 22 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to grant him a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during a debate on Palestinian issues scheduled to begin Dec. 1. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said no application had been received. An English-language daily published in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reporter </LOCATION>, said Thursday that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had declared a moratorium on attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as part of the effort to promote the declaration of a Palestinian state. On Friday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters, it applied for a visa at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> issued a two-page statement the next day rejecting the visa request. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has convincing evidence that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> elements have engaged in terrorism against Americans and others.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, as <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman, `` knows of, condones, and lends support to such acts'' and is `` an accessory to such terrorism,'' the secretary said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> applauded the decision but was the only government in the world that did. Allies and friends of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged a change of heart. Critics even included the British government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's staunchest ally. A Foreign Office spokesman said: `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would have liked to hear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> confirm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and `` has renounced terrorism.'' Arab nations said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate would be moved to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> granted the visa within 48 hours. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said its decision was `` firm and final'' and consented to moving the meeting. On Tuesday, the assembly postponed the debate. A senior <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomat said privately it probably would begin Dec. 13 or 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carl-August </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON>, senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> legal counsel, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was violating the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, which requires the host country to provide visas for people invited by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement says `` federal, state or local authorities of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shall not impose any impediments to transit to or from the headquarters district of representatives of members or officials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, or of specialized agencies -LRB- or -RRB- representatives of non-governmental organizations recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for the for the purpose of consultation.'' In refusing the visa, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> relied on a paragraph in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law passed on ratification, which is not part of the agreement. It says: `` Nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to safeguard its own security and completely to control the entrance of aliens into any territory of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> other than the headquarters district and its immediate vicinity ... and such areas as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in transit between the same and foreign countries.''

<HEAD>Former Secretary Says Pentagon Already `Bankrupt'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> called Tuesday for cancellation of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bomber project and two aircraft carrier groups to trim spending by an already `` bankrupt'' Pentagon. He said the budget will have to be cut $ 150 billion to $ 200 billion dollars over five years and the department, itself, restructured. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who was defense secretary from 1961 until 1968, said he sympathized with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s unnamed choice to run the Pentagon. `` There is just no question about it,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at the private group's annual luncheon meeting. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is bankrupt. They have on contract and plan for contract more weapons than any reasonable level of a budget will support for the next five years.'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said cutting the budget and restructuring the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` is going to be one hell of a job, particularly if you do it without reducing security.'' In fact, he said, `` it's damn near impossible and perhaps politically impossible. You are going to have to cut two carrier groups, either the B-1 or B-2. You are going to have to do all kinds of things that are going to be politically unpopular.'' In his speech, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> urged completion of a strategic arms reduction treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> designed to slash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent. `` The treaty can be completed in a year or less,'' he said. But, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said, arguments raised against the treaty could cause the process to unravel. He cited the claim the cutbacks would make remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles more vulnerable to Soviet attack and that the numerical advantage in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ground forces would pose a greater danger to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` If the attacks continue they can prove to be decisive and we will lose the marvelous opportunity to reduce weapons and increase stability,'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Publisher Joins Campaign to Protect Civil Liberties</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The publisher of the newly banned <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s magazine joined about 200 prominent Britons on Tuesday to accuse Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of violating civil liberties. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, president and publisher of the American magazine, distributed copies of the banned December issue at the meeting, which was convened to unveil a charter calling for an U.S.-style constitution and bill of rights. The <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s issue contains excerpts from the memoirs of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavendish </PERSON>, a former officer of the MI6 intelligence service, which British newspapers are barred by a court order from publishing. The government says distribution of the magazine, which sells 200 copies monthly in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, would violate the injunction. It says it is trying to uphold the principle that an intelligence operative, bound to secrecy for life, can not publish memoirs. `` We object to censorship in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>. He added that <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s published the Cavendish memoirs as a `` cautionary tale'' to alert Americans to secrecy moves by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Believe me there is no cause for smugness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. The charter accused Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of eroding civil liberties during her nearly 10 years in power. `` A process is underway which endangers many of the freedoms we have had ... and is now gathering momentum,'' it said. It indirectly referred to her anti-union legislation, limitations on suspects' right to silence, and a ban on broadcast interviews with groups supporting terrorism. The latter was directed at <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Signers included novelists <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Drabble </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>; pop musicians <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON>; playwrights <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Frayn </PERSON>; actors <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>; and Nobel Prize-winning scientists Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and Professor <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>. But while blaming Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government for failing to defend civil liberties, the charter representatives said the problem was rooted in the British political system. `` It's not an attack on this particular government, although this government with its overriding parliamentary majority has shown how any government _ without checks and balances, without any chance of going to the courts or people _ may destroy liberties,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a leading civil rights lawyer and key figure in the campaign. `` Our unwritten constitution is merely conventions, winks and nods, elbowing, which, if the government unilaterally decides, can be snuffed out like that,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. He said he was also concerned that because former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> colonies still look to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for legal precedence, `` we're seeing British law becoming supportive of repressive governments.'' The charter calls for a written constitution which enshrines civil liberties in a bill of rights, establishes freedom of information and open government, makes an electoral system of proportional representation, turns the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> into an elected body, provides legal remedies for abuses of power, and guarantees equal distribution of power between local and national bodies.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Shuttle Performed `Brilliantly,' Longer Mission Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet space scientists declared a brilliant success the unmanned maiden voyage of the space shuttle Buran, and are planning a much longer second mission, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` The previous program was brilliantly performed; when the craft came to a halt on the runway its time deviation from the program reached only one second, while the deviation of the Buran's axis from that of the runway was only 1.5 meters,'' the official news agency reported. Only five of the 39,000 heat-protecting tiles broke away during the 3-hour, 20-minute flight Nov. 15 and the spacecraft, whose name means Snowstorm in Russian, successfully maneuvered in bad weather, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It quoted Gen. <PERSON> German </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> as saying: `` We deliberately refused to postpone the launch and wait for ideal conditions. The value of the flight is that its program included the maximum sum of real and rather difficult tasks.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the landing took place in relatively high winds and thick clouds. Officials have said the shuttle's second flight also will be unmanned. No precise information on its length was available. Cosmonauts on another Soviet space mission, a joint project including French cosmonaut <PERSON> Jean-Loup </PERSON> <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON>, began working aboard the orbiting space station Mir on Tuesday, a day after docking their Soyuz TM-7 capsule. <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> will return with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, who have set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year when they make the descent Dec. 21. Commander <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON>, who went into space with the Frenchman, will remain on the Mir until April. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said one project, designed by French scientists, is to make a detailed study of the cardio-vascular system in space flight, using ultra sound to evaluate blood flow.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The departing head of the federal health bureauracy urged his colleagues on Tuesday to keep AIDS from becoming a political issue as they attempt to build support for fighting the disease in the years ahead. `` We have treated AIDS simply and solely as the public health crisis it is,'' <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> told a gathering of top federal officials involved in fighting the epidemic. `` Politically, our goal must be to build a consensus to keep the focus on public health,'' said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` At the same time our political actions must be consistent both with the available knowledge and the proper protection of the public health, we also must take care not to make the AIDS crisis a referendum on lifestyles, or a chance to push liberal or conservative agendas.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, a physician and former two-time governor of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, has stated that he plans to return to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and spend his retirement years tending his garden when a new administration takes over Jan. 20. His remarks to more than 200 federal officials convened for a two-day conference had the tone of an informal farewell to the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> troops engaged in the struggle against AIDS. `` People with AIDS should never be treated like political footballs or, on the other hand, political prizes,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> told them. `` We must never broker the lives of people with AIDS for political advantage. `` Also the AIDS crisis is not to be viewed as a battlefield for career advancement or an opportunity to win awards,'' he said. Without naming names, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said some people `` have helped to foster deep divisions which are counterproductive and destructive to the cooperation and partnership necessary to successfully combat this epidemic.'' He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will face many difficult policy questions _ for example, whether distributing clean needles to addicts might be warranted in restricting the spread of AIDS, even though such a program `` may send the wrong message that drug use can be made safe.'' Another troublesome question is what to do about a pregnant woman who shares needles with other addicts infected with AIDS and thus threatens her baby with the infection, he said. `` What action should the state legitimately take to protect the baby?'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> asked. `` Here we have to balance rights and decide how far the state can go to protect a baby threatened by the virus.'' He said many other public health concerns are equally complex, `` but those in leadership positions are going to have to face up to these differences of opinion and make the tough choices.'' Losing sight of the need to keep public health policy separated from liberal or conservative political agendas `` opens the door to danger,'' said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. For example he cited the work of scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have long had a high regard for what's being done at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, and rightly so,'' he said `` But what would happen if one political party twisted scientific information to meet a social agenda or to advance political fortune? Then, people would be justified in questioning the accuracy of that information, leaving doubt as to the real facts.'' He said there is already `` a temendous amount of denial now.'' `` Many people want to believe that they are immune to AIDS, or that somehow this ca n't happen to them,'' he said. `` If scientific information were altered to suit our own political purposes, we run the very real risk of creating even more doubt, dissension and disbelief. the ultimate result could be the continued spread of the virus, perhaps at an accelerated rate.''

<HEAD>SEC Proposes To Tighten Rules on Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday proposed tightening the rules that govern stock trading by corporate officers and other so-called insiders. Since 1934, federal regulations have required corporate officers and directors to disclose publicly whenever they buy or sell stock in their own company. The commission, by a 3-0 vote, invited public comment for 90 days on what would be the first major change to the rules since they were established to prevent `` insiders'' from gaining advantage from information not available to all stockholders. Corporate officers are supposed to report to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> within 10 days of acquiring insider status. They must file subsequent reports in the first 10 days of the month after they buy or sell stock. According to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff, 43 percent of the reports have been filed late so far this year. An unknown number of insiders never filed at all. Under the proposal, companies would be required to list violators in their annual reports and proxy statements. Insiders also would be required to report trades in exchange-listed options as well as stocks. A new and narrower definition of insider is being proposed to include only chief executives and other policy-making officers. And the commmission is asking for public comment on whether it should seek authorization from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to impose fines against violators. Currently, its only option is to seek a court order forcing compliance.

 A toddler's abdomen was virtually replaced Tuesday in a rare five-organ transplant that doctors said was the 3-year-old girl's only chance for survival. Rolandrea Dodge of <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, received a new liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and a portion of a large intestine. The young donor was not identified. <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON>'s spleen also was removed. `` The patient is doing fine,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Satoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Todo </PERSON>, who headed the surgical team at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Todo </PERSON> said the 16 -LCB- - hour operation, which is considered experimental, went smoothly except for one episode when the chilled organs inserted into her body lowered her temperature dramatically and her heart stopped beating for about a minute He said surgeons restarted her heart with cardio-pulmonary resuscitation techniques. <PERSON> Todo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON>'s heart was functioning normally following surgery, and she was moving her hands and legs. Her liver also was producing bile, a positive sign, he said. She was in critical condition in the hospital's intensive care unit after the operation, which ended at 3:40 p.m. Tuesday. `` The prognosis is very difficult to say, but I'm expecting it to go well,'' <PERSON> Todo </PERSON> said. Five organs have been transplanted simultaneously only once before. Last November, <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 3 -LCB-, of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, underwent the same operation at the same hospital. She died six months later of a blood infection. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> survived longer than any of the other three people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who had abdominal transplants involving two or more organs. `` They -LRB- doctors -RRB- may have gone ahead with a little more confidence knowing how far <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> succeeded,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON>, who is known as <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON>, was born with an incurable disease called intractable secretory diarrhea, which prevented her intestines from absorbing food and liquids. She had to be fed intravenously, although she was allowed occasional nibbles of candy, potatoes and other solid food. Aside from brief outings, <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON> has spent her entire life in hospitals. The girl's liver began failing about three months ago as a result of her high-protein intravenous feedings, and her skin became jaundiced. She received a pancreas and stomach in addition to intestines and a liver because it is easier to implant a large portion of the abdominal tract all at once. <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON> arrived in October to be evaluated for transplant. She was accompanied by her parents, <PERSON> Branden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, who also have two sons. Her parents were with her before she went into surgery. Doctors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said she would n't survive long without a transplant. Doctors began administering an experimental drug Nov. 9 in hopes of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids, but it was unsuccessful, Ms. <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. `` That was really the last available treatment option,'' she said. Dodge, 27, a coal miner, said it was difficult deciding whether to allow the transplant, but `` it's the only hope that we've got left.'' `` We do n't have any doubts,'' he said. `` It's just the way our <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> people are. That's just the way they taught us, try not to think negative about things, it's going to work out.''

<HEAD>Justice To Review DEA Drug Seizure Practices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will review a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> practice of sometimes arranging for local police to make well-publicized seizures of drugs brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the control of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> operatives. Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, the No. 3 official in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, plans to meet with <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss the matter, said <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a department spokesman. The meeting stems from a <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> story Sunday which said the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> had arranged at least two drug seizures by state or local authorities in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area to generate false news reports which would protect the identity of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> undercover operatives. The undercover operatives sometimes pose as middlemen and ship loads of narcotics into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> druglords. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> on occasion then arranges for local law enforcement agents to seize the incoming drug shipments in an attempt to insulate the operatives from disclosure, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. In addition to keep the drugs off the street, the practice also is designed to allow the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to continue criminal investigations aimed at top-level narcotics figures, the sources said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, said it is misleading to the press and public for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to initiate what becomes a highly publicized drug seizure by state and local police when the shipment has in fact been controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I understand they have to find some way to protect the lives of the people and the security of the operation, but when they engage in subterfuge or creating situations that really do n't exist, they have to expect that sooner or later people are going to find out,'' said <PERSON> Seigenthaler </PERSON>. `` They have to find some other way to protect people and the security of the operation.'' In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> said it is not the agency's policy `` to lie or mislead the media, nor is it our policy to misrepresent information to the media. No techniques have ever been used or will ever be used that are designed to out and out mislead or lie to the media or public.'' But `` to preserve the integrity'' of ongoing probes which often involve wiretaps, undercover operations and money laundering, and to assure that the highest level traffickers are eventually prosecuted, `` we can not release all of the details of these events as they occur,'' the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> statement added. The techniques used to prevent drugs from reaching market become public knowledge at the time of prosecution, the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> cited an instance in 1984 in which <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into the country, then abandoned their van at a prearranged roadblock set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> alerted news reporters that troopers had found a cache of drugs which they described at the time as one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest seizures. A <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> case agent, describing the arrangement in testimony during a bond hearing for a man arrested in the operation, testified that `` we had a prearranged setup arranged with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> where they would stage a traffic stop and seize the contraband.'' In a second instance, on Sept. 29 of this year, said the Chronicle, a load of cocaine was planted in an abandoned car and left to be discovered by deputies with the <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, sheriff's department, who notified reporters. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> declined to discuss the Sept. 29 seizure, but denied that the cocaine had been planted in the car. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also denied that the agency had been in control of the Sept. 29 shipment.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political movement was buying expensive <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> properties at a time when millions of dollars in loans to his organizations were not being repaid, the political maverick's conspiracy trial was told Tuesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, a <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aide, said a <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> real estate company spent about $ 4 million on land for a security training facility, for a summer camp for children of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> employees and a farm where <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> live when in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. During the same period, around May 1986, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, who was seeking repayment of nearly $ 113,000 in loans, that she could not be repaid because no discretionary funds were available. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates are on trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges that they conspired to defraud investors by not repaying more than $ 30 million in loans that they made to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by failing to declare as income personal and household services provided him by his organizations. Welsh, who received immunity from prosecution, testified that $ 5 million of the loan amount eventually was repaid. Welsh, who was assistant treasurer of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign and still works for him, said the campaign devised a plan to pay back $ 4 million it borrowed for that campaign but that the repayment system broke down. He said the campaign still owes between $ 1.5 million and $ 2 million. <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said that when lenders complained about non-repayment, the local campaign organizer who originally secured the money was to attempt to have the loan forgiven or a new schedule of payments worked out. But <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said the system did not work well, because some organizers never got back to the lender and others made an `` insufficient effort.'' In some cases, he said, lenders were told something would be done when no action was planned. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> asked Welsh if lenders were told in effect, `` the check is in the mail'' when no check had been issued. `` Yes,'' Welsh replied. Under cross-examination from <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Odin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> sought to distance <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> from day-to-day operations of his organizations. `` He is the founder and leading thinker, the primary person who defines broad policies ... general objectives and political goals,'' Welsh said. `` I do n't recall him involved in day-to-day financial operations.'' <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> also told the jury that in September 1986 he launched `` Project Apollo'' to gain `` control of the loan situation.'' He said the project involved a combination of repayments, requests for forgiveness of loans and attempts to have promised interest rates lowered or payments stretched out. He said the operation came to a sudden halt when federal and state law enforcement authorities raided <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters Oct. 6, 1986, and `` seized just about every scrap of paper having to do with any financial record.'' Despite the raid, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> testified, virtually all the 3,500 people with loans outstanding had been contacted and total debt by early 1987 was reduced by $ 1.5 million. In addition, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said that in April 1987 the three main LaRouche organizations that owed lenders money were placed in involuntary bankruptcy, in a government action that froze the groups' financial transactions. The final disruption to the repayment campaign, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said, came when several banks froze <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organization accounts after it became public knowledge that a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was investigating the movement's financial dealings. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization. Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines of $ 3.25 million for LaRouche. The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987. In the tax conspiracy count, the federal grand jury charged that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has not filed a federal income tax return since at least 1979. On trial with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> are his chief fund-raiser, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>; his legal adviser, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>; and four fund-raisers: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> extended a truce with guerrillas through the end of December, but said Tuesday his nation will maintain a state of alert until it sees a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s leftist Sandinista government extends a March 21 cease-fire unilaterally on a monthly basis. The U.S.-backed rebels, called Contras, say the truce is indefinite and need not be extended. Each side has accused the other of violations. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> renewed the charges Tuesday during a news conference at the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. The truce forbids offensive military action. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> denied Contra claims that soldiers have attacked, and characterized recent army operations as defensive. He is in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the Thursday inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and said he had no plans to meet Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who will represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would wait and see what happens when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is installed in January as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but told the news conference: `` While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government does n't show a changed attitude toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, we ca n't change our own readiness, up to and including the possibility of invasion by American troops. We are in constant and permanent alert.'' Other Nicraguan officials have said they expect a more `` pragmatic'' attitude toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he hopes the new administration will accept `` as a reality that we survived all the efforts of a superpower to destroy the Nicaraguan revolution.'' He referred to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support for the Contras since they began fighting eight years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has refused to provide money for weapons since March. The Nicaraguan president said the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> inauguration gives <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> presidents a good chance to discuss problems on an informal basis, and said they should arrange a future meeting `` without preconditions.'' Presidents <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> also are to attend the inauguration but not <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for a Central American peace plan that was agreed upon Aug. 7, 1987, but has stalled. When asked if he would be willing to drop a complaint against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said: `` We should meet without any preconditions to discuss our problems, and not only if all our problems are solved.'' The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire agreement March 23 under which the rebels were to stop fighting in exchange for democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Both sides suspended offensive military operations and a formal truce took effect April 1. Talks on details of the truce agreement broke off and no negotiations have been held since September. Most Contra fighters have left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> of harboring the rebels and permitting them to launch operations from Honduran territory. That is the basis of the World Court action.

<TEXT>
 Dozens of former senior army officials joined about 10,000 demonstrators in front of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> on Tuesday to protest draft deferments given to Orthodox yeshiva students. `` The fighters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from all generations are against draft evasion,'' proclaimed a sign on the speakers' platform set up in Kings of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` Living on somebody else's blood,'' read another sign held aloft by protesters. Speakers told the banner-waving rally that about 19,000 ultra-Orthodox youths were granted deferments in 1988, letting them postpone army service while they study in yeshivas, or religious seminaries. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and a reserve army general, told the mostly liberal audience it was unfair for ultra-Orthodox parties to demand Cabinet seats if they supported avoiding national service. `` Morally, the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not accept such a thing. It ca n't be that they will have only rights and not duty as well,'' said <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON>, a liberal member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc Former Chief of Staff <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, leader of a far-right party that advocates annexation of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said ways could be found for yeshiva students to learn the torah and serve their country at the same time. `` The public has to demand of its representatives that existing standards be changed,'' said <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>. Asked about military exemptions at a meeting of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the agreement with the Orthodox went back three decades and no plans were under way to change this informal undertanding. He denied rumors that the issue was discussed in <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s ongoing talks with four small religious parties, who demanded religious legislatio in exchange for supporting a Likud-led government. Leaders of ultra-Orthodox religious parties denied that yeshiva students enter seminaries to avoid military service. They say most eventually wind up in the army. However, they say study of the torah and Jewish religious tradition can not be limited to specific periods of time. Thus, students often miss the compulsory three-year national service because they exceed the maximum draft age of 26. Poet <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefer </PERSON>, who wrote well-known songs commemorating <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1948 war of independence, disputed contentions that most yeshiva students did serve in the army. He said that in 1986 only 244 of 17,017 eventually did their national service. He gave no figures on how many eventually served in the reserve army. All males up to age 49 must serve up to 62 days a year in the reserves. <PERSON> Hefer </PERSON> said 5,877 students postponed military service in 1970, but deferments swelled to 12,596 during the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war and now exceeded 19,000. Reserve Col. <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Raz </PERSON>, former head of the women's corps, said religious women should no longer be exempt from military service. Religious women are usually required to do a one-year community service instead of the two-year women's army service, but this is not enforced. A veteran who lost both legs, an arm and an eye in the 1982-85 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war said, to loud applause, `` I do n't understand why I had to fight and lose my legs, and lose my friends, while someone sits in school and prays.'' The veteran, identified as <PERSON> Maoziya </PERSON>, said he would soon be doing a voluntary one-month tour of reserve duty, and `` if I can go to the reserves so can they.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> moved closer to coalition on Tuesday and Orthodox religious parties threatened to withdraw support for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who offered Labor two of the four most important Cabinet ministries if it joins the government as a junior partner, said he would finish forming a government in a few days. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of Labor urged his center-left party to join a government led by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in order to block Orthodox demands for religious legislation opposed by Jews abroad. Religious parties want a new `` Who Is a Jew'' law that would accept only conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> performed by Orthodox rabbis. The demand has angered American Jews, most of whom belong to the Reform or Conservative movements. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have been equal partners in a `` national unity'' coalition since the inconclusive election of July 1984. In the Nov. 1 election, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 of the 120 Parliament seats and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 39. Right-wing religious parties won 18 seats. The ultra-Orthodox party Shas, which made participation in a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> government contingent on religious legislation and control of two ministries, threatened to withdraw its support, party spokesman <PERSON> Tzvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakobson </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has to promise that we will receive two ministries even in a broad-based government,'' he said. `` Otherwise we'll see ourselves free from the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the threat came after a `` short and stormy'' meeting between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Rabbi <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON>, the Shas leader, in which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refused the demands. The Council of Torah Sages, spiritual leaders of Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, another Orthodox party, met to discuss the coalition developments and media reports said one possibility raised was a switch of support to Labor. `` We're not chained in an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdiger </PERSON>, the party leader, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> could not form a right-wing coalition without <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> and Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which together have ll seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament Some in <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> urged <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to accept the Orthodox demand. Cabinet minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a rival of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s who fears being bypassed if a deal is struck with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, called the law a national necessity. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> wants to be defense minister, which is one of the senior posts offered to Labor and probably would be kept by <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The other presumably would be the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> held by <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was prime minister and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> foreign minister in the first two years of the `` national unity'' coalition.

<DATELINE>EXETER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ruled Tuesday that two children should be placed in a foster home rather than with their mother, who went to jail last year claiming she was hiding them from an abusive father. <ORGANIZATION> Rockingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> ruled that the father, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, should have joint custody of the children with his ex-wife, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>. Previously, Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> had custody, and her ex-husband had visitation rights. Both mother and children have been missing since <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION>, was acquitted earlier this month of a charge of sexual assault of his daughter, now 5 -LCB- years old. After the verdict, he said he would seek custody of the girl and her 4-year-old brother. He also obtained a court order barring Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> from taking the children out of the state or letting them live with anyone else. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, went to jail for a week in February 1987 rather than tell a judge where she hid the children from their father. But she apparently never was served the court order later obtained by the father, and she and the children have been missing since the verdict. Through several media interviews, she has said she is living with a family out of the state in a network that protects alleged victims of sexual abuse. <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said Tuesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, even though she was not served with the papers, was in enough contact through the media to know she should not have left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Also, he said, in this type of case, such an order does not have to be hand-delivered but can be mailed, which is what the court did. <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> is violating a visitation agreement she had with her husband. He also said though he gave them joint custody, it would be in the children's best interest to stay in a foster home. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> initially had asked for joint custody with the state, and wanted the children to be placed in a foster home. Through his lawyer, <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> said his children have been brainwashed by their mother and that it would be some time before they learned to trust him again. He eventually wants full custody, he said. State guardian <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> exercised poor judgment by going into hiding because it is harmful to the children's mental health.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Uncover Ancient Port</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL HIRSCHHORN_</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists have uncovered a Bronze Age port on the Israeli coast with a warehouse stocked with raisins, peas and olives dating to about 1,200 years before <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, the director of the excavation said. Professor <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haifa </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview that the site uncovered at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nami </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of the modern port city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, could be the oldest man-made port ever found. `` In that period, seafarers tended to hug the coast, and they used to come into port once every two days for food, so you needed ports along the shore at set stretches,'' she said. `` There is little reason for this site to exist, except as a port.'' Researchers found evidence a channel was cut between the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and a river to form the port, Ms. <PERSON> Artzy </PERSON> said. She said the port appeared to date to at least 2000 B.C., but further research was needed to confirm the date. Objects uncovered in excavations begun last year include gold and silver jewelry, bronze sculptures and pottery from ancient civilizations, Ms. <PERSON> Artzy </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Artzy </PERSON>, who also serves on the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, was assisted on the dig last summmer by students from <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A and M at College Station and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Foodstuffs found in a warehouse were well preserved because a fire in about 1200 B.C. apparently caused a roof to collapse, blocking oxygen from reaching the food and damaging it, she said. `` We have whole examples of seeds and raisins, like your mother used to give you when you were a kid,'' Ms. <PERSON> Artzy </PERSON> said. The site apparently was abandoned after the fire and never resettled. She said artifacts found at the site indicated local residents were very wealthy and that the port was an international trading center. `` These were sea people with a lot of wealth,'' Ms. <PERSON> Artzy </PERSON> said. She added: `` Whether it was from piracy or this is simply a rich port, we do n't know.'' The pottery came <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the ancient Greek states of Troy and <LOCATION> Mycenae </LOCATION>, and elsewhere, she said. She displayed other items that were found, including gold rings and earrings, a child's gold necklace, silver rings and a hand-crafted Egyptian ring. So many bronze items were found that archaeologists believe a bronze workshop may have existed at the site. Items include one bronze stand for incense burning that is decorated with pomegranates and another with the figure of a woman. `` These are especially valuable because they are unusually well preserved,'' she said. `` There was obviously a cult aspect to this, the woman's body and the pomegranate, perhaps a fertility cult.''

<HEAD>Hart Campaign Agrees to Pay Fine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign, still trying to clear up its debt-ridden books, must pay a $ 12,000 penalty for violations cited in an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The campaign agreed to pay the civil penalty for violations that included <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s use of his personal credit card for campaign expenses beyond the $ 50,000 the law says a candidate may contribute to his campaign. In a separate penalty, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> cited a violation by the media firm, <ORGANIZATION> Semper-Moser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to pay $ 5,000 for improperly advancing the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> campaign more than $ 100,000 worth of credit. Although the firm expected to be paid back the money, and ironically ended up going to federal court to get $ 106,000 in back payment, the credit arrangement with the campaign was illegal because it was not `` in the ordinary course of business,'' according to the settlement statement recently made public by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. Election law requires that companies conduct relations with political campaigns in the same manner that they would with any other entity, to ensure that no special treatment is accorded the campaigns. By agreeing to provide time buys and media services for <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s TV commercials on credit, which was not a customary practice, <PERSON> Semper-Moser </PERSON> was making a corporate contribution, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> found. Corporate donations are banned in federal elections. The debts relate to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s first race for the presidency. The former senator from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> also entered the 1988 Democratic primary race, dogged by the debts of his attempt four years earlier. While the 1988 campaign ended up solvent, the 1984 effort still owes more than $ 1 million to creditors, according to the latest report on file with the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> found that <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> improperly used his personal credit card for more than $ 20,000 worth of expenditures above the $ 50,000 contribution limit he was allowed. While there was an understanding that the campaign would pay the bills promptly, the payments were made an average 266 days late, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s campaign claimed he was unaware of the tardiness and that all the bills eventually were paid. But the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> faulted the campaign for failure to pay in a reasonable time. In addition, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s campaign acknowledged receiving contributions from 49 individuals whose donations exceeded the $ 1,000 per-person limit imposed by election law. The excess contributions totaled $ 19,606, and the improper donations were ultimately refunded.

 Black and Jewish veterans of the civil rights movement joined hands Tuesday and sang `` We Shall Overcome'' as they remembered their coalition's martyrs and looked to its future. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, whose presidential library was host to the two-day conference on black-Jewish relations, called cooperation between the two groups in the civil rights movement `` an extraordinary demonstration of common purpose.'' `` I saw even while I was in the White House some beginnings of fragmentation in that partnership, and I think your effort to bring it back together and to derive the great benefits that can flow from it is indeed a noble effort,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told conference participants Tuesday. A memorial service honored <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, civil rights workers killed in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in 1964, as well as others who were slain, such as Martin Luther King Jr.. <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> was black, while <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> were Jewish During the service, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, read a brief quotation from King, and <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, read from the writings of a Jewish victim of the Holocaust, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The service was prolonged as conference participants brought up many more names of departed heroes, including many who were neither black nor Jewish. The conference was designed to chronicle black-Jewish cooperation of the past, but several speakers Tuesday emphasized the coalition's recent strains and its hopes for reconciliation Conference participant <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> called the difficulty in black-Jewish relations `` something terrible.'' `` I think in retrospect it was based more on ` not in my back yard' than any other sentiment,'' <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> said. He said he hoped the two-day conference, which concluded Tuesday at the Carter Presidential Center, would be a catharsis. Among those warmly recalling old friendships Tuesday was <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` There was no more important relationship in the civil rights movement than the relationship of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Levison </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He called <PERSON> Levison </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney and activist, an important voice of reason who emphasized non-violence. The conference, `` The Black-Jewish Alliance: Reunion and Renewal,'' was sponsored by the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> center, the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is spending $ 90 million to rebuild a launch pad for its new Titan 4 rockets, which will take secret military payloads into space, an official said. Space Launch Complex-4 East has been used for Titan 34D launches since 1982 and was rebuilt after one exploded in April 1986. The Titan 4 will carry payloads previously intended for the space shuttle. <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>'s shuttle pad was dismantled in the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. The 1986 explosion of the Titan 34D destroyed what was reportedly a spy satellite and put the launch pad and one close by out of commission for more than a year.

 The roar of chain saws and the smell of pine from shattered trees permeated the air Tuesday as residents began putting their lives back together and cleaning up from an estimated $ 100 million in tornado damage. `` All my damage is minor compared to some of these people,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> as he and his wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, began cleanup and repairs. Their house had broken windows and a piece of log embedded in the wall; a tool shed was destroyed. The <ORGANIZATION> Johnstons </ORGANIZATION>' next-door neighbors were worse off _ the side of their house was torn off. `` They'll have to move,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` This whole neighborhood is going to change a lot.'' Four people died, 157 were injured and about 850 were left homeless as the tornadoes tossed cars, houses and trees like playthings along a 200-mile stretch of eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> early Monday. It was the first time since the state began keeping records in 1916 that tornadoes caused deaths in November, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>. Damage was estimated at $ 100 million statewide, according to the state public safety department. Raleigh alone suffered $ 75 million in damage, the city manager's office said. Teams from the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> fanned out Tuesday to calculate damage in all nine affected counties and determine what areas would be eligible for federal disaster aid. The dead were 12-year-old <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON> and 9-year-old <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>; and a <LOCATION> Nash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> couple, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, who died in each other's arms when the storm hit their mobile home. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other relief agencies said they were swamped with offers of help. `` It renews your faith in humanity,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON>, nurse coordinator for the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter. More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by the storm, she said, leaving only 17 people in a <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> shelter. `` That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' she said. `` People in the city do n't think other people care much about them, but when something like this happens, we come together.'' Businesses, individuals and churches donated food and other supplies. A table in the school cafeteria was piled with sandwiches, fruit, snacks, candy and desserts. In <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, police restricted access to damaged areas, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurek </PERSON>. Fourteen people have been charged with looting since the tornadoes struck, according to a Wake County magistrate. Six Raleigh residents, including four juveniles, were charged Monday with looting from a K mart that was flattened by the storm. The state public safety department said Tuesday that 520 homes were destroyed and more than 1,200 were damaged. Forty-one businesses were either destroyed or damaged. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> asked the federal officials to declare <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> a disaster area, and the surveys of other counties will help determine whether any other areas might also be eligible for disaster aid or reduced-cost Small Business Administration loans. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Warlick </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said damage in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is probably extensive enough to warrant assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. A presidential disaster declaration is required for <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> aid to be released. `` We are going to send a delegation to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with these letters -LRB- requesting disaster aid -RRB- to make sure that any question can be answered face to face if necessary,'' he said.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attorney for convicted Nazi war criminal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> died Tuesday after hurling himself from the 15th floor an office building, police said. Police ruled the death of <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> a suicide. A court official said it could delay <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s appeal of his conviction and death sentence for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes, scheduled next week. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a 53-year-old former judge who joined <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s defense team in August, died after jumping from the 15th floor of the City Towers office complex in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> did not leave a note explaining his motives, but deputy police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said police were certain the death was a suicide. `` There was no note at all, none. We are trying to determine what was behind it,'' <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. `` But there was no criminal element. It was suicide, 100 percent.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said police found traces of polish from <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>'s shoes on the sill of the window from which he jumped in the 15th-floor lobby of the Ayalon Hotel <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> entered the lobby without being noticed by the receptionist, the only person there, the radio said. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, said the defense would request a delay in the appeal, set to start Monday. Court spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> said the bench probably would grant at least a week's delay <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamgar </PERSON> invited the parties in the case for a discussion in his chambers Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Shamgar </PERSON> is to decide whether the appeal proceedings will start Monday or be postponed until <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> appoints a new lawyer, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> was to have presented 60 percent of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s appeal and that other lawyers would not be ready to argue the case Monday. `` We're very upset and concerned,'' <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We spoke to <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> yesterday. He was extremely optimistic and said he hopes to see us in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, was convicted in April of crimes against humanity and against the Jewish people. He was found to have been `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who lived in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Seven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> before being extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in February 1986, claims he is a victim of mistaken identity. Court spokesman <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> said he saw <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> on Monday and he appeared `` very cheerful.'' `` He was checking all the court arrangements, where the accused would sit, where he would sit. It's all very strange,'' <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, 27, said the family had left a message for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> at his maximum-security prison about <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>'s death `` I'm sure this is going to be a shock to my dad. He really got along well with <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> and had a lot of confidence in what he was going to do for him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> a week ago. An attorney who previously represented <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said he hoped police would investigate the death `` to see if there was any foul play. `` I'm not suggesting there is or would be or was. But I do think that would have to be explored,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. A defense witness, Swedish-born <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrists and swallowing tranquilizers on Aug. 21, 1987, after her testimony was discredited during the trial. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> served for 17 years as a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> district court judge before retiring in 1983. His joining the defense was widely viewed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as adding prestige to the team. He is survived by his wife, who lives in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and two children.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader on Tuesday by Democrats seeking a forceful new spokesman during yet another Republican reign at the White House, and he quickly promised <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his initiatives will be met with `` interest and enthusiasm.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a 55-year-old former federal judge, easily defeated Sens. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. He succeeds <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, who stepped aside after 12 years as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Democratic leader. Asked if he would cooperate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he plans to meet soon with the president-elect and `` We hope to move forward on a broad range of issues,'' including the federal deficit, health care, day care and the environment. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also planned to meet Wednesday with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, re-elected by Republicans to a third term as their leader earlier Tuesday. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> received congratulatory calls from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as well as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The Democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals of the next administration,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who was just elected to his second term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, has a liberal voting record but promised `` to work with all the Democrats in developing a broad agenda.'' Within minutes of his election, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> emerged from the party caucus in the historic old <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber of the Capitol to meet with reporters. Quickly turning aside suggestions he would be a partisan fighter, he said, `` We hope to cooperate with the new administration to deal with the serious problems and important challenges facing our nation.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> fell only one vote short of winning the Democratic leadership post on the first ballot, picking up 27 votes. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> tied for second at 14 votes each, and quickly agreed to give <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> a unanimous victory. `` The best man won. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> will be a great majority leader,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a janitor's son who worked his way through college, was looked to by many colleagues as a solid, articulate leader and speaker who can serve as a spokesman for all Democrats. `` I think the Democrats have realized the need, in the presence of a Republican administration, to have a person who not only makes the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> function but also be a party spokesman,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del. `` There was a unanimous feeling, even among those who supported the other two candidates, that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> well fits that bill,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said that although <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is an Eastern liberal, `` his impressive margin of victory is a welcome signal that the liberal and progressive ideals of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have broad support among <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats from all parts of the country. Perhaps <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s greatest claim to public fame was his performance last year during the Iran-Contra hearings. In a quiet but nationally televised confrontation with Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who had testified with great patriotic fervor, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> looked at the witness and spoke into the microphone: `` Please remember that others share that devotion and recognize that it is possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to the Contras and still love God and still love this country just as much as you do.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus also elected Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to another term as party whip, despite a challenge from <ORGANIZATION> Wendell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> was elected president pro tempore of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and also will serve as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes next January. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> defeated <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to become secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> defeated <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to become chief deputy whip and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was named chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was re-elected GOP whip without opposition. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> defeated <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> as conference chairman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> was elected chairman of the policy committee, <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> was elected conference secretary and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickels </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> defeated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s legal committee voted 121-2 Tuesday night to ask the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to grant <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were opposed. It was an indication of how lopsided the vote is likely to be Wednesday when the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> takes up the Arab-sponsored resolution deploring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> denial of a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> so he can address the assembly at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In denying the visa on Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had condoned acts of terrorism committed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday it said its rejection was final. All <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member nations are represented on the legal committee, but not all were present for the vote Tuesday night. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials meanwhile began calculating the cost of the unprecedented step of moving the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> speak on the Palestinian problem and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues. One source suggested it could run around $ 150,000. Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they have enough votes to reconvene the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. They said the session probably would be in the week of Dec. 12-16, with Dec. 13-14 the likely dates. It would be the first time the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has shifted its session in protest, although special sessions have been held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Most nations were expected to assign their <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> ambassadors to the session and nations would bear the cost of their own travel, diplomats said. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday delayed its annual debate on the Palestinian problem, originally scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Dec. 6, to permit arrangements for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to speak elsewhere. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection of a visa set off an international uproar and demands that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> be allowed to speak. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities reject the resolution to reconsider, as is expected, the next step will be a second resolution later this week seeking to move the assembly to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the diplomats said. Backstage deliberations sponsored by the British failed to remove harsh language from the first resolution. It says <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in `` violation'' of the host country agreement and `` deplores'' the failure to grant <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa. Under the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledges not to impede the travel or work of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats or guests. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> holds non-voting observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and is an honored invitee. It is considered the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and is invited to speak in all such debates. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the strong opposition to his decision to bar <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> shows that people are forgetting what a threat international terrorism is. `` To some extent the opposition suggests how important it was to decide what was decided and to make it so clear what the basis was,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` The basis -LRB- was -RRB- our concern about terrorism and I am afraid that it's too easy for people to forget what an important problem that is and what a threat it is to civilized society.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Israeli Premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Tuesday praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for denying <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa, saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not genuinely desire peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He told a luncheon of Israeli newspaper editors that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made `` a brave decision'' based on a longstanding commitment to fight terror. Many Arab and other nations argue that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> deserves to be heard because of what they say is a more moderate stance taken earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile At its conference in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, the council issued a declaration of independence that included implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The recognition was contained in an acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions recognizing the rights of countries in the region to exist.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders Tuesday he will seek speedy confirmation of his Cabinet, perhaps with hearings beginning even before he takes office on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators he hopes any `` honeymoon period'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can yield a federal budget compromise, according to participants in a private get-acquainted meeting at the Capitol. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., said the president-elect indicated he wanted to meet with `` a bipartisan group to discuss his thoughts'' before submitting a budget outline of his own However, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the 1988 Democratic vice presidential candidate, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` should not be in the position of not sending any budget up.'' `` This will be his first test of leadership. He has to show what he believes in _ national defense, Medicare, revenues? He has to speak to the principal points of the budget. That's part of the price of leadership,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` They just won an election. It's theirs to call.'' Republican senators said the vice president indicated during their meeting that he would take up the matter of early confirmations with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s newly chosen majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to congratulate him shortly after Tuesday's secret-ballot election among <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to meet with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on Thursday, sandwiched between meetings Wednesday and Friday with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, two Democrats who spent much of the year criticizing Republicans in general and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in particular. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will talk at the vice president's residence Friday afternoon in their first meeting since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defeated the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for the presidency three weeks ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> meeting was `` in keeping with what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has traditionally done, which is to be open and talk to people who are interested and concerned.'' In 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, then controlled by the Republicans, voted confirmation of key appointments of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s within hours of his inauguration. Democrats now have a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would be important to his administration if he could have early action on confirmation, particularly with some of the key people like -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for secretary of state, said Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said that, if Democrats went along, confirmation hearings could be held on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominations before they are formally submitted. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does come into session on Jan. 3. We could do some work between then and the inauguration,'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he would like the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to `` expedite the hearings and consideration of those nominees to those Cabinet positions so that when the president is inaugurated, they started to work right away, with the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in place.'' Three members of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he will retain _ Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> _ do not require re-confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In other developments Tuesday: _ A source close to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a decision by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on defense secretary could come by Wednesday. The source said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still favors former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but that some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers are objecting, partly because they do not have a high regard for close Tower associates likely to get choice Pentagon jobs. _ Other sources said that <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, is emerging as the leading candidate for transportation secretary. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and close associate of Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state campaign director during the presidential campaign this year and in l980. In his meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated a promise to work with both Democrats and Republicans in forging a budget agreement, perhaps beginning before his inauguration. While the senators shied away from using the term `` budget summit,'' they indicated that's pretty much what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has in mind. `` I think it's going to develop that way but I do n't know the timing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he was in a `` listening mode'' in his second trip to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> since his election His first was two weeks ago, when he met with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I'm getting the message'' rather than carrying advice. `` We're ready to go to work, ready to work with the new administration,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after the breakfast session. `` We pledged our cooperation; he's pledged his.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought his choices for chief of staff and budget director, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked by reporters if he supported moves to hold a special meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` There should be a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting and there will be a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting on that subject,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He did not elaborate. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said it is neutral on the subject of whether such a meeting should be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to give <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a forum to plead the Palestinian cause. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to give <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said he was not consulted on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision to bar <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s entry

<HEAD>Jailed Bishop Released For Role In Abortion Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POCOPSON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic bishop, two pastors and four other activists were released Tuesday after spending a day in prison for an illegal protest at an abortion clinic last July. Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was believed to be the highest-ranking church official to go to prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for an abortion protest, and drew a letter of praise from Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwilling </PERSON>, spokesman for the archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> and the other activists left <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prison about 10:15 a.m. Tuesday, said Warden <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frame </PERSON>. They entered the prison at noon Monday to serve a two-day sentence. Frame said the period counted for two days under the terms of the sentence and the rules for computing time served in prison. The four men and three women were among 591 people arrested July 5 at the Women's Suburban Clinic in <LOCATION> Paoli </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, after they blocked entrances in defiance of two court orders. They were the first of more than 400 people scheduled to go to prison. District Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mull </PERSON> found all the defendants guilty of defiant trespass for the July protest and fined them $ 10 plus $ 50.50 in court costs. Those who refused to pay on grounds of conscience were sentenced to two days in prison. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> and the other protesters were held in regular cells, Frame said. A group of supporters held an hourlong prayer vigil outside the prison Monday night, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Pro-Life Coalition of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s -RRB- willingness to undergo imprisonment, even for this short a time, provides a tremendous boost for our efforts,'' <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s stand also was praised by <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in a letter Sunday to the bishop. `` What you do today you do for all of us who want with all our hearts to do the same but are not free to do so at present,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, telling <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> his example `` will give courage to thousands of other mothers to choose life, however difficult the choice.'' Besides <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, those released after serving the two-day sentence were <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Parkesburg </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Willsher </PERSON> of Reading; the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doron </PERSON>, pastor of the non-denominational Church of the New Covenant in <LOCATION> Marlton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossens </PERSON> of Beechwood, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glassboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

 A judge ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> should be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial for a string of sex murders in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Trussler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Alberta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bench </ORGANIZATION> decided that the former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, born in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, should be extradited on 19 of the 25 offenses he is charged with in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. She said she would issue a warrant that would keep <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> in prison in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> until he is surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. Charges of murder, kidnapping and burglary have been filed against Ng in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He is accused in the murders of 12 people. Eleven of the deaths of men, women and children involved grisly sex slayings at a rural cabin in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The 12th involved the death of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> disc jockey. Ng could face the gas chamber if convicted. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> said he will appeal Judge <PERSON> Trussler </PERSON>'s ruling <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> said earlier arguments could take the case all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, which could take up to five years. Ng, whose name is pronounced <ORGANIZATION> Ing </ORGANIZATION>, faces possible execution in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. His lawyers are seeking to invoke a provision in the Canada-U.S. extradition treaty that says extradition may be refused unless the requesting state guarantees the fugitive will not be executed if convicted. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> does not have the dealth penalty. Ng, who was educated in British private schools, is serving a 4 -LCB- - year sentence at a maximum-security federal penitentiary in Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>, for shooting a security guard in the hand in December 1985 during a botched shoplifting attempt at a department store in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Trussler </PERSON> told a hushed courtroom she was satisfied, on evidence filed during a six-week extradition hearing, `` that the offenses charged in the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are extraditable with one exception.'' The exception was a charge of accessory to murder. The judge dismissed five other charges of kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap because no evidence was shown of transportation of the three people involved, as required under Canadian law. She ruled evidence from <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s alleged partner in the crimes, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, should be admissible. Ng came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> was picked up for shoplifting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and committed suicide. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22 people. That investigation led to the charges against <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>. `` I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the evidence ... that there was a general conspiracy that related to weapons, money and sexual gratification,'' she held.

 An 18-year-old man who was released from a juvenile probation camp this summer has been arrested for investigation of two rapes and an attempted kidnapping at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Deon </PERSON> <PERSON> Proby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was arrested Thanksgiving Day for investigation of a kidnapping and robbery that occurred earlier in the day in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugel </PERSON>. Bail was set at $ 250,000. Detectives subsequently began investigating <PERSON> Proby </PERSON> in connection with three attacks on women at <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> in the last two months, he said. A fourth assault occurred on Friday, after <PERSON> Proby </PERSON> was jailed, and authorities said at the time that it appeared unrelated to the earlier attacks because the assailant's description differed. Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said <PERSON> Proby </PERSON> was being held for investigation of rapes that occurred Oct. 29 and Nov. 5, and an attempted kidnapping on Nov. 9. During the Nov. 9 attack the assailant was frightened off by a passer-by, but did steal the victim's car, which was later recovered, he said. In the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> incident the assailant approached two women and forced them to drive off with him in their car at gunpoint. They were later released. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the women were not sexually assaulted. The attacks have prompted women on the campus to walk in pairs and use a campus escort service after dark. <PERSON> Proby </PERSON> was released from juvenile probation camp in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Aug. 26, <PERSON> Pugel </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A 12-year-old boy was charged with second-degree rape Tuesday in an alleged attack against his former babysitter, a 30-year-old mentally retarded woman who lived next door. The woman was attacked Sept. 22 at an elementary school across from her home, said Detective <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>. The woman, who has cerebral palsy, lives with her 68-year-old mother, who said she believed that the boy and possibly others in the neighborhood beat her daughter with a stick, then raped her. `` Three days before this happened, he -LRB- the 12-year-old -RRB- asked her for sex,'' the mother said. `` She knew enough to say ` No.' He said, ` I'll get you.''' The boy was arrested Monday. Detectives were investigating the mother's belief that other youngsters were involved, <PERSON> Burris </PERSON> said. Arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday in juvenile court, with a detention review to determine whether the boy should remain in custody. <PERSON> Burris </PERSON> said the young woman's fear and limited mental capacity, plus a lack of physical evidence, hampered the investigation. She did not tell her mother she had been raped until three weeks after the alleged attack, the mother said. The detective said the woman was able to communicate some details of the alleged attack, but he was n't sure whether she would be able to testify at a trial. The boy could receive up to seven months in juvenile detention, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office. The mother said the attack occurred after her daughter went to a convenience store. `` She used to baby-sit the boy when he was little. -LRB- He -RRB- knew she was mentally retarded,'' the mother said. She said her daughter had `` two great big goose eggs on her head, and they took a stick and cracked her across the nose. She had black eyes for two weeks. They beat her legs until her legs were all pulpy.''

 Authorities probing the suicide of Prince <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, the 33-year-old great-grandson of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s last emperor, and the drug overdose of his wife found puncture wounds on their arms and syringes in their luxurious villa, sources said Tuesday. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> apparently drove to a secluded woods and shot himself in the head Sunday shortly after his wife, Princess <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON>, 26, overdosed on cocaine. <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> was found dead by her husband in their bedroom at the posh Koenigin-Villa, a family property at <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, a lakeside resort in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Salzkammergut </LOCATION> lake district. Police sources in <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Linz </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> province, said Tuesday that a preliminary autopsy showed the Austrian-born woman died of heart and lung edema after consuming cocaine. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON>'s great-grandfather was <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> security police, who spoke on the condition of not being identified, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> syringes apparently used to inject drugs and a small amount of an unspecified `` powder'' were found near the body of the princess. The <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a source in the public prosecutor's office, said the powder was cocaine. The public prosecutor's office at <LOCATION> Wels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, said investigators found punctures on the arms of the dead prince and princess, suggesting narcotics use. The result of an official post mortem was expected later this week. Police said the case also is under court investigation, but declined further details. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON>, a distant relative of the British, <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> royal families, was found dead near a small lake at <LOCATION> Almtal </LOCATION>, a wooded area about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, police said. His hunting rifle was beside him, police said. The couple, married last year, left an 8-month-old son, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, Austrian newspapers said. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON>, a descendant of the ancient <LOCATION> Guelph </LOCATION> dynasty that includes some of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s top aristocracy, and his wife dined Sunday night with members of a little-known West German pop group, police said. The princess retired early and was found dead by her husband at 2:45 a.m. He called the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and told them that she had `` probably taken cocaine,'' a police spokesman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON>, a distant relative of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, also called his brother Ernst August in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, reportedly telling him of his suicide plan and asking him to take care of his son. He then hung up abruptly, Austrian newspapers said. After making the telephone calls, the prince took his hunting rifle and drove away from the villa, police said. His body was found about four hours later. The couple belonged to the European jet set, moving in the world of rock music and fashion. The prince spent many years in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and the princess attended a fashionable school in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, before training as a secretary in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The prince was the middle son of three sons of Prince Ernst August of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> and the grandson of Emperor <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Viktoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Luise </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brunswick-Luneburg </LOCATION>.

 A newspaper columnist won the 1988 National Book Award for fiction Tuesday with a novel about a murder in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and another journalist captured the non-fiction prize with a book about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, 45, a columnist for the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Bee and a frequent contributor to national magazines, won for `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Trout,'' about the murder of a 14-year-old black girl by a white man in a small <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town just after World War II. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, 52, who was <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> bureau chief in 1962 and worked for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> from 1964 to 1972, won for `` A Bright Shining Lie: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vann </PERSON> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s book examines the war through the eyes of one who lived most of his adult life in the midst of it. `` I feel like a man who was on a long voyage of discovery ... who's finally come home,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said after the winners were announced. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, who took 16 years to write the book, obtained the Pentagon Papers in 1971 while working for the Times. His book combines biography and history to tell the story of Lt.

I like being on the street and hearing different voices,'' he said. The writers' comments came at the awards ceremony, attended by about 500 people at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel. In all, 10 authors were nominated for the 1988 National Book Awards. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLillo </PERSON>, who won in 1985 for `` White Noise,'' was nominated for `` Libra,'' a novel based on the life of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and the events that led to the assassination of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, expressing regret that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was unable to regain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, asked its <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members on Tuesday to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` the same friendship, support and solidarity that you gave me.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks came at a farewell dinner attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators and their spouses. The president also lavished praise on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s onetime political adversary, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, as a `` good friend'' and a man who `` has never let me down.'' President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator met for lunch on Monday, pledging to put their past political rivalry behind them and promising to work together on the budget deficit and other problems. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won the leadoff <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recaptured the momentum by winning <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and went on to score a near sweep of the 17 state Super Tuesday primaries. After the dinner in the Great Hall of the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was presented with a gift from the senators _ a large `` weed whacker'' for his ranch in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It's a high-tech, top secret device that can be used to clear out weeds, brush, trees, rattlesnakes, desperadoes and Democrats,'' quipped <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who presented the device to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In his remarks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a pillar of the party. `` I want to say a special thank you to a good friend, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, as a man I have come to know so well,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding, `` He is a man so widely respected and admired that even senators on the other side of the aisle routinely steal his jokes.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went on to portray the newly elected Republican team as men who will work to continue his conservative legacy. `` As I prepare to return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, nothing has meant so much to me as the knowledge that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, each one of you, and our whole Republican team, will be working together for the values we share and the future that stands before us,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` My friends, we need have no regrets, we deserve to be proud,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, but he also added: `` I must say, I wish we could have regained control of this body.'' The president went on to predict that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will `` win control of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the same way we keep winning the White House. `` Sooner or later, the other party is going to have to take the hint and put themselves out of their misery,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, looking back on his nearly completed eight-year term and the 1980 election that swept the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into Republican hands, said of his party, `` We have succeeded beyond anyone's expectations.'' The president bid adieu to those turned out of office, and asked those remaining in the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which will contain 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans, `` I know that you will continue to do honor to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that you will give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the same friendship, support and solidarity that you gave me.''

 Two teen-agers were arrested Tuesday and charged with murder in a sniper attack on three <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> white-water rafters that left one man dead, and authorities said the boys apparently opened fire on a whim. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 17, was arrested Tuesday morning at his parents' home east of the Big Bend village of <LOCATION> Redford </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The 16-year-old, whose name was being withheld, was arrested by <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> state judicial police in <LOCATION> Ojinaga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Authorities were still seeking two other people in the shootings. Both teen-agers were charged with murder in the Nov. 19 death of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>, a Mexican citizen who is a resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also was charged with assault in the non-fatal shootings of <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>, and river guide <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>. The group was rafting down the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Redford </LOCATION> when shots were fired on them from a 300-foot-high canyon rim on the Mexican side of the river. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> suffered a gunshot to the right thigh and Ms. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> was shot in the left shoulder and left side. Her husband was shot fatally in the back as he shielded her and tried to drag her to safety. The snipers stalked them from the canyon rim as they abandoned their bullet-riddled raft and scrambled down the river bank. Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON>, 32, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that her assailants should be executed for the attack. `` I'm glad about the news but I think there are two more out there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> said. `` From what I understand, I remember that I had seen four. `` I'm glad that they are being caught and I think this incident should be made a public example,'' she said. `` I think they should be executed, because if they are not, relations will never get better across the border. Nobody should have to go through this kind of torture.'' `` We have no motive for the shootings,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said, adding that both teen-agers gave statements implicating each other. `` They saw them coming down the river and decided to shoot at them.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said police on both sides of the border, acting on a tip, arrested the teen-agers about 8:30 a.m. `` It was just information that we had all received,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said, refusing to elaborate. `` We think the arrests of the other two -LRB- suspects -RRB- will be in a reasonable length of time.''

 The first <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> plane to land at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 14 years touched down with more than 100 young Soviet professionals Tuesday night and was greeted by American sponsors bearing yellow roses. The Soviet airliner landed about 6:30 p.m., nearly an hour late. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelnokov </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said his group was tired from the 15-hour flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` But if you look in our eyes, you will see we are very excited to arrive in this country on this very historic occasion,'' he said. The Soviet visitors, ages 28 to 40, planned to spend 2 -LCB- days in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area as guests of Rotary International before traveling to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Thursday for a seven-day U.S.-USSR Emerging Leaders Summit and to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for a four-day visit, Rotary officials said. They were to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Dec. 10. The roses, symbolizing friendship, were presented to the visitors, few of whom spoke English. `` We want to provide a nice sort of prelude,'' Rotary spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said of the floral greeting. `` This -LRB- visit -RRB- kind of complements real well what we're trying to do.'' Members of the 80 <ORGANIZATION> Rotarian </ORGANIZATION> families that will open their homes to the Soviets used nametags to match visitors with their hosts. `` I'm really excited about it,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lisle </LOCATION>. `` We might even show them a McDonald's and the Sears Tower.'' <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> charters to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> stopped in 1974 because of `` policy differences'' between the Soviets and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Rotary officials said, and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flights to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, stopped in 1982. Regular service between the two countries resumed in April 1986 as tensions between the two countries eased, said <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisachev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> manager for <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet airline now has two regular flights a week from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and one from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisachev </PERSON> said no regular flights to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are planned immediately. The Soviet visitors, who include television anchorman <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozner </PERSON>, represent 16 professions, including the clergy and the military, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We want to give them an idea of what the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> is like,'' she said from Rotary headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. `` We -LRB- also -RRB- want to show off <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> a little bit.'' The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> meeting officially is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> and a Soviet organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. The groups asked Rotary to be host of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> visit, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Wednesday's schedule included dinner _ with <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> and all the trimmings _ at a downtown hotel, as well as a visit to the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was to speak to the group at a luncheon. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Glenbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, were two of the 80 Rotary families preparing to play host to the Soviets. `` We're having roast beef for dinner,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` But also, I'm making a chocolate cake _ certainly typical of this American family.''

 An absent-minded robber who left his gun inside a bank during a hold-up and locked himself out of the building was tracked by a newspaper photographer, who ordered him to `` stop or I'll shoot.'' Photographer <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> was near the Montgomery-Traders branch bank and heard the robbery report on his police scanner, Officer <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> followed the robbery suspect, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, and pointed out the man's location when she and a deputy sheriff arrived after the Monday morning robbery in this eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The photographer said he followed the man to prevent his escape but also had wanted to find a way to coax him to turn around for a picture. `` I stood behind a telephone pole and I said, ` Stop or I'll shoot,''' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said `` And I did shoot him, I shot his picture.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said the man did not stop but continued running up a hill. When Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> arrived, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he yelled and pointed in the direction of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, then took photographs as police made the arrest. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 34, was charged with first-degree armed robbery. He was held in lieu of a $ 25,000 full cash bond Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Regional Jail. The robber had forced his way into the bank shortly before it opened by holding a woman employee at gunpoint near the back door, Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. He forced another female employee to unlock the vault and had both workers fill a duffel bag with money. Afterward, he made them lie on the floor while he tied their ankles together with duct tape, Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The robber also took the car keys of one of the women. `` While he was tying them up, he laid his gun on a pop machine. His mistake _ he left it laying there'' when he went outside to put the money in the woman's car. `` He forgot that the -LRB- bank -RRB- door would lock behind him, and he could n't get back inside.'' By then, a third employee was arriving at the bank, and the suspect tried to get that employee to let him back inside, but he refused. `` He told him that he had robbed the bank. ... He went to the woman's car and got the money out of it, and he started walking off,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The suspect was arrested soon afterward. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said a picture he shot of the arrest ran on the weekly newspaper's front page this week and more photos appeared inside.

 Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands wounded 20 Palestinians Tuesday, hospital officials said, and merchants were caught between one faction demanding a strike and another insisting they stay open. Among the wounded were a 10-year-old boy shot in the leg and a 14-year-old hit in the chest, the Arab hospital officials said. More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded in a year of rebellion against Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 316 have been killed and 11 Israelis have been slain. Gangs of young Islamic extremists and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activists armed with knives and clubs marched through <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Tuesday, shouting threats at each other and issuing conflicting orders. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- sprayed a warning to merchants on walls in Islamic green: `` Today is a strike day. Be sure you observe it.'' Followers of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> kicked on closed doors, shouting to store owners that they would be protected from <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> if they opened. The strike was widely observed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a predominantly fundamentalist <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town, was completely shut down. Army commanders strengthened patrols and imposed curfews on more than two dozen refugee camps, towns and villages. At least 370,000 of the 1.5 Palestinians in the territories were confined to their homes. At the root of Tuesday's factional conflict was a disagreement between <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> over the proclamation Nov. 15 of an independent Palestinian state. The declaration is based on a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition plan that called for both <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and a Jewish states in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> rejected it and called a protest strike for Tuesday, the 41st anniversary of the partition plan. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, backed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, did not call for a strike. In a recent leaflet, <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leaders said: `` How is it possible to think that Jews want a just peace? The Jew is a Jew, regardless of the party he belongs to.'' Three masked <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> followers in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town, flagged down Arab-run buses en route to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and forced them to turn back, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses reported. The young men entered the buses and shouted at the drivers: `` Go back! Go back!'' Stores were closed in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. One shopkeeper told reporters other merchants complied after being threatened by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> loyalists. An elderly man later advised him: `` Do n't tell these things to outsiders.'' Another group urging a strike Tuesday was the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, which also rejected the independence declaration. Palestinian leaders expressed concern about the growing rift and said it might harm the uprising in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. `` We know about the risk of this confrontation. We are working to stop it,'' said <PERSON> Sufian </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> surgeon whose views have been identified with those of the Popular Front. <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> also said the coinciding strike calls did not indicate a new alliance between fundamentalists and hardline <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions opposed to even implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We have some points in common but we are not together in the field,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Another Palestinian official said the independence declaration by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, had wide support in the occupied lands. `` A majority of the Palestinian people are behind the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Study of International Affairs. Armed Jewish settlers in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> launched highway patrols on Tuesday to protect Israeli drivers from being stoned by Palestinians. Three cars patrolled the roads, each bearing a large Israeli flag, said organizer <PERSON> Yacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshel </PERSON>. He said soldiers stopped one car at an army checkpoint near the Palestinian town of <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION> and told the driver he could not enter unless he removed the flag. The driver refused, and was turned back.

<TEXT>
 A government official indicated Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is linking efforts to free foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with the fate of Iranians believed held there. `` There are n't just American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but there also are Iranian hostages, who are in the hands of Christian militiamen,'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, said. He made the comment after meeting with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, whose three-day visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was dominated by the hostage issue. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> was refering to three Iranians who disappeared with their Lebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped by Christian Phalangist gunmen. The four are widely believed to have died. No group claimed responsibility for their kidnapping. `` Western nations, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have close ties to -LRB- the Phalangists -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> told reporters. `` We want all hostages to be free, the Iranians as well, and we will work as much as we can so that they are freed.'' He did not specify what actions <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might take. In remarks quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> also did not rule out resuming ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If one day we were to resume ties with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> such a relationship would certainly be on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in each other's affairs,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has offered to act as mediator in gaining the release of 14 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, West German government sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s good contacts with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> throughout the Iran-Iraq war were seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Before ending his visit on Tuesday, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told reporters he urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders to `` to use all possibilities toward contributing to the release of all hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' During his stay, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> held talks with <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and other Iranian officials. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he raised the hostage issue in each of his discussions.

 Consumers may cut back on big-tag Christmas presents now that the nation's biggest banks boosted their prime lending rates to 10.5 percent, the highest level in 3 -LCB- years, some analysts said. The increases in the key lending rate by a half percentage point were announced Monday and were the fourth this year. Many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recent weeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been rising due to inflation speculation and the dollar's weakness in foreign exchange. `` It comes as no surprise.

 In an age when half the marriages fall apart, when commitments to that bond come hard and many delay it or shun it entirely, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> theologian offers a paean to marriage's beauty. The Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> sees it as next to heaven itself. While he recognizes it does n't eliminate the sorrows and difficulties of life, he finds in marriage the balm that eases those hurts and gives a glow of wonder to all existence. `` To be married means to be redeemed,'' he says. `` To be married is to be loved only for who we are, not who we might wish to be or who we might seem to be.'' It is, he says, to be a `` new creation.'' In a book, `` Redeeming Marriage,'' recently issued by <ORGANIZATION> Cowley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> extols marriage in often lyrical terms comparable to the biblical Song of <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>. `` Night had become the time to feel close, in touch, arms and legs wrapped around the other, the only one,'' he writes. `` The one who knows me and who I am and what I feel and even who I would be... `` Day means assuming a role, playing a part ... At night, it was all real. ... The time just at dawn had a different kind of magic. ... Without her there would be no dawn, for there would be no reason to rise, to greet the day, even to have a day.'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> takes an unusual approach to his subject, interspersing descriptions of marriage and episodes from it with lines of the marriage ritual in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer and Scripture passages. A professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION>, he recognizes the strains of life, describing various marriage breakdowns, causes behind them and also the restorative help of friends. But mostly, he tells of the bracing grandeur of marriage itself. `` We offer ourselves to our spouse and are known, fully, and accepted and loved. ... It is not acceptance of what we might wish to be, but of who we actually are. ... It is grace, in all its fullness. `` Such acceptance results in a sense of worth, self-worth, which is given by the one to the other. Somehow, this make it possible to mean something, be something, even do something. `` Every moment, every word, every action suddenly come into being in a new way. Strange and wonderful, quite mysterious, one is unable to function fully without the other. `` The ancient and most holy miracle: to be loved. One plus one equals a thousand.'' Novelist-theologian <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON> says of <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>'s analysis: `` In an age that tends to take marriage lightly and cynically, his high view of it reminds us of what, at its richest, it can become. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> says the ancient biblical image in Genesis of a man and woman becoming `` one flesh'' is the powerful and miraculous truth of marriage. That gift is `` beyond any other experience available to us,'' he says, `` as close as human beings may come to know the reality of heaven this side of the grave.'' He points out decisively, and quite happily, the disciplines required of a genuine marriage, including patience, unswerving fidelity and total, unconditional commitment to the other. `` Nothing is to be reserved or held back. ... The old cliche that marriage will only work if each reserves a small corner of the self as private, never to be shared, is erroneous and worse, dangerous. `` For that small and reserved part will grow and grow and grow until it ... destroys the marriage.'' Children are n't the main object of marriage, he says, noting that marriage exists before they come and after they're grown and gone. `` The essential fruit of marriage is the joy of becoming one flesh. That miracle has nothing to do with children ... The gift of marriage is the gift of one another.'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> deals plainly and gracefully with the sexuality of marriage, saying that any marriage without sex is dying or dead, but he emphasizes that other qualities must precede and underly it, saying: `` The first is affection, the most basic love, a part of every love, and no love is possible without it. Affection is built upon familiarity, time spent together, time which binds two persons toether in common experience ... `` The second is friendship. A relationship moves from the familiarity of affection to the desire to develop common bonds, common understandings, common hopes and dreams ... `` The third is eros, sexual passion. It is not lust, which is blind. Eros seeks one particular person and one person only, striving for fusion with that other ... Eros will not occur unless first one has experienced affection and then friendship. `` The fourth is agape, the love of God. ... It is a love which sees and knows us just as we are and loves us still and all. ... Marriage includes all four loves.''

 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s arm shoots up in the air midsentence and he snaps his fingers. `` You know what it was? I'll tell you what it was! The seed was planted in high school, because I had an English teacher and we had to write a term paper. ... I could n't come up with anything and -LRB- the teacher -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulassa </PERSON> said, ` Here's some books. Why do n't you read these and see what you think?' And he gave me ` On the <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>,' by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>. `` That was the beginning of the end for me. You know, the beginning of the end which turned out to be the great beginning.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, was searching his memory for the genesis of the story of how a kid from a small blue-collar town in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> found himself in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as co-host of a network morning news show. `` CBS This Morning'' celebrates its first anniversary this week. Though it is still struggling in the ratings behind <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and co-host <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> have developed an easy-going rapport, and the network seems content to let them develop a following. The pressure does n't seem to get to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the most likely successor to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON> as CBS' resident laid-back philosopher. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s feet-on-the-ground attitude comes from deep Midwestern roots and a strict religious upbringing. His father worked two jobs, as a policeman and a milkman. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was the youngest of eight children, most of whom `` got married pretty young and went out into the world and got real jobs and had real lives,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I was the youngest and kind of the surprise. I got a little bit more attention than the other ones did, had a rich fantasy life about doing something other than going to work at the <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> Sheet and Tool.'' Most of those fantasies revolved around television. `` I used to watch <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Paar </PERSON> and just used to be fascinated by characters like <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Levant </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Certainly in my realm of existence there was n't anyone real like that, and would n't it be interesting to meet people and know people like that?'' Despite a budding interest in literature and philosophy, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> went to college on a football scholarship and planned to be a high-school football coach. He attended <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pella </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, an intellectually `` dangerous'' place for a young jock, he said, `` because they said, ` Here are books. How would you like to read them?' And so I did, and my notions about being a football coach were short-lived.'' He graduated with a degree in communications and theater. After a stint as a public TV talk-show host in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, he moved over to <ORGANIZATION> KMGH-TV </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate. There he anchored the noon news with another reporter, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>. Their courtship sounds right out of `` Broadcast News.'' `` We were just buds,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We worked very hard and were very career-oriented and all that sort of stuff, so professional that neither of us would have ever considered going out. We used to ` convenience date.' You know, ` I've got this thing to go to, would you go with me? Just go with me.''' A `` convenience date'' to the opera led to romance and later marriage. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was a Dallas-based correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when he was tapped for `` CBS This Morning.'' Even though it means getting up at 4 a.m., <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says the schedule at least is regular and has allowed for a `` second honeymoon.'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> now reports for Madison Square Garden network. They go to Central Park everyday with their wire-haired fox terrier. `` I do n't know if I can do it forever. I saw where <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> celebrated 12 years and I do n't know if I could do that,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. His favorite part of the job is most like being a correspondent _ going on the road to cover every kind of news story, from political conventions to hurricanes. `` There's gon na be a time when I just do that again,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Does n't have to be next year or the year after. There's a time down the line when I'm going to go back and maybe that's what I'll do for a living. I'll be a correspondent based somewhere.''

<HEAD>A Plan For Stock Market Liquidity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 What this market of corporate stocks needs is liquidity, said the professor, and he went on to suggest that the corporations themselves consider providing it. The professor's observation has its origins in the debacle of Oct. 19, 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average dropped hundreds of points in a few hours, devouring about one-half trillion dollars of value. Now that's illiquidity, said the professor. There were sellers everywhere and almost no buyers, and many of the specialists, who are supposed to buy when others are selling, were swamped by the avalanche. It could have been worse, says Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. In fact, it would have been worse if companies had n't used their own cash to buy back their own stocks. He feels they helped turn a tide that could have destroyed the market. Observing those actions, the professor developed a detailed plan to eliminate excess volatility in securities markets by asking listed companies to establish permanent stabilization funds. These funds would remain on the sidelines, invested in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury notes, until they were needed. And that need would be determined by a precipitous drop in stock prices. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, who teaches economics and finance at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, would have the companies enter the market to buy a preset number of shares when the price of their shares fell to a certain level. He offers this example: <ORGANIZATION> XYZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has 100 million shares outstanding at an average share price of $ 52.50. It decides to stabilize prices by buying 100,000 shares if the price drops $ 2.50 to $ 50 a share ... and sell 100,000 shares in a comparable rise. The transactions would be triggered only when the price rose or fell by an increment of $ 2.50. If the efforts failed to stabilize prices then the company would be prepared to buy another block at $ 47.50 or sell at $ 57.50. The company would be prepared to buy shares at each $ 2.50 increment down to a total price drop of $ 30 a share. For <ORGANIZATION> XYZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, this would require a stabilization fund of a little more than $ 42 million. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, author of the recently published `` Equity Markets: Structure, Trading and Performance,'' justifies his thesis by stating that the only way to stabilize a market is to commit capital to market making. The result of his plan, he says, would be more stable markets, increased investor confidence and perhaps a bonus for the corporations. He explains that the stabilization funds themselves might generate positive cash flows because participating companies would realize gains from routine buying and selling at certain price intervals. In effect, they would emulate the work of the successful specialists, making their profits from the spread between bid and asked prices. Should such a plan work, it might encourage individual investors to return to the market, which they fled in droves after _ and some smart ones before _ the October 1987 debacle. One of their main fears has been volatility. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, whose proposal was published in the fall 1988 issue of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portfolio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, believes the stock market remains overly volatile because of insufficient liquidity. He suggests that the liquidity added by the corporations themselves would serve to mitigate sharp moves in at least two ways, first by the infusion of money, and then by assuring owners to hold firm rather than dump. To avoid any corporate manipulation of stocks, he would allow the buy and sell orders to be entered only upon market openings and re-openings, and would have exchange officials supervise the transactions.

<HEAD>Tussel Over Who's Jewish May Be Easing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 That recurring old battle over `` who is a Jew?'' appeared this week to be headed toward some kind of temporary compromise, or at least less than an intra-Jewish breakup despite the verbal fireworks. In certain quarters, harsh words still were being traded over the issue. But several signs have shown up both in this country and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that some sort of stop-gap arrangement or avoidance of an outright breach may be in the making. The question has heated up many times over the last two decades, usually in connection with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s political splintering which often has parties dickering with each other for sufficient clout to govern. The issue boiled to a head this month as a result of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s latest inconclusive elections in which neither major party, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> nor Labor, won a clear majority That left the Orthodox religious parties, who won a substanial minority of parliamentary seats, holding the power to tilt the balance either way and to inject their demand for defining Jewishness. They contend that converts to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> are validly Jews only if converted under Orthodox rules, thus excluding those converted in Reform or <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, embracing most American Jews. As repeatedly sought through the years, the Orthodox parties want <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` law of return'' offering automatic citizenship to all Jews amended to apply to converts only if recognized by Orthodoxy. That would cut out the Reform and Conservative converts, obviously relatively small in numbers, but raising a highly charged principle of equity for the three wings of Judaism. In any case, the outcry has come hot and furious from Reform, Conservative and <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> secular Jewish organizations, charging such a change would rend the fabric of Jewish unity and erode <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At the same time, some ultra-Orthodox groups have called the outburst an anti-Orthodox `` hate campaign,'' `` engaged in mud-slinging at Orthodox Jews.'' However, there were some tempering hints in the wind. Leaders of 2l national <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish organizations, Reform, Conservative and secular, were in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this week, making their rounds to try to head off the moves toward a showdown. Delegation spokesmen said that in a surprising development, both of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox chief rabbis, who support the Orthodox political parties, requested meetings with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group. Meanwhile, a main <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Orthodox body, the <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, voiced an unusual conciliatory note. It joined in urging that the question of who is a Jew be resolved not by a political body like <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- parliament -RRB- but by discussion among Jewish groups. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> labyrinthine political maneuvering, Prime Minister <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, to gain support of the Orthodox parties and give <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> a majority, at one point reportedly promised them their long-sought change in the law of return. But later, he was reported bidding for renewing a shaky coalition with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' Labor party, which has seemed reluctant about it, but later indicated flexibility. It also needed allies to forge any governing front. Beyond these religious and political shiftings, indicating some chance at some resolution that wo n't split Jewish ranks, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leader said that whatever the outcome, it should not undermine support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> which had voiced keen outrage at the threat to rule out Jewish coverts other than those of Orthodoxy, said: `` American Jews must not permit the political controversy over who is a Jew to turn us away from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or to weaken our resolve to defense its cause.'' He implored <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders `` to put Jewish unity before considerations of political expendency'' and avoid any action that would shatter the `` solidarity that binds the Jewish people everywhere'' to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but he added: `` Today, we must fight against any change in the Law of Return with every resource at our command and, at the same time, we must stand with the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as if there were no political power brokers who would read us out of the Jewish fold.''

 When it gave birth to Western civilization, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> was the world. Ecologists today are calling it a `` Paradise Lost.'' Ravaged by man over the centuries, the face of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> has been scarred _ lush forests felled, wildlife silenced, mineral-rich soil long gone, aquamarine currents fouled by oil slicks. But some of the region's leading thinkers are trying to rediscover a `` Mediterranean identity'' through the only common bond they can find: a determination to save what's left of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>'s environment. It's a region `` whose contribution is acknowledged by the world, but whose future lies in doubt,'' wrote <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>, international relations adviser for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>, among 60 delegates who discussed the state of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> at a recent international conference in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> sponsored by the Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italia </ORGANIZATION>, called on the region's 18 countries to unite their cultural and political wills to shape a brighter future. The institute, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, brings together political, economic and cultural leaders to discuss current issues. A clear message emerged from the conference: the only way to solve environmental, social, economic and political ills of the area is to find common ground uniting the diverse cultures tied by geography to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` There's only one issue that can join us now, and that's the environment,'' <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister and president of the Italian institute, said in an interview. `` Despite the vast differences between industrialized countries that border the northern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and less-developed countries bordering the south, everybody agrees we have to do something about the environment. It's the only rallying point we have, the one issue public opinion can use to force politicians to act.'' Delegates from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> region has greater potential for environmental progress than most because of its manageable size and historical links its countries share. They agreed, however, that despite the work of numerous local and international agencies, governments are n't doing enough. A major topic of the conference was the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> Action Plan, a survey dating from the mid-1970s seeking to balance the area's environmental and development needs through the first quarter of the 21st century. The <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> basin is among the most developed regions in the world despite its varied cultures, but its population and industry are shifting rapidly toward its fragile coastlines. Tourism is increasing greatly throughout the region, and almost half the millions of annual tourists remain along the coast. The basin has 29,000 miles of seacoast, only 40 percent of which is flat, usable land. Additionally, population is growing unevenly, declining slightly along the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>'s richer northern tier and expanding rapidly in the poorer south. Experts warned of threats from other sources: ships dumping toxic or hazardous wastes, deforestation on both sides of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and the lack of effort to find alternatives to fossil-based fuels that pollute the atmosphere. One proposal to spur <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> recovery, suggested by <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebeid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s minister of Cabinet affairs, calls for the setting up of a `` green belt'' along the entire <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, while praising the virtues of the concept, cautioned that national politics can and often do override environmental considerations. He said the only way to achieve necessary international cooperation for a project of the scale of the `` green belt'' proposal would be under the flag of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Whatever is done, delegates to the conference agreed that the need to do something is acute.

 If <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> felt strange about seeing `` The Brady Bunch'' all grown up in the CBS reunion movie, so might viewers who are still hooked on reruns. `` The Brady Bunch'' are starting little bunches of their own, but they all got back together to celebrate Christmas in `` A Very Brady Christmas'' on Sunday. In addition to <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, back are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> as father <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as housekeeper <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, Eve Plumb, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lookinland </PERSON> as the kids. Only <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> did not return for the two-hour movie, and the role of <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> is played by <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>. `` It felt strange to go back to the roles,'' said <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and I were very nervous trying to get back into those characters. The kids are all grown. That's going to be quite a shock to all those kids who watch the reruns. `` The house has been redecorated. I'm into real estate now. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s still an architect. One son's a doctor, one's a race car driver, one works in an office. One girl's married, one's married with a career and the youngest is in college. Plus, there are three grandchildren. Can you believe that? `` In the story <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and I try to give each other surprise trips. I choose <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, he chooses <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Instead, we decide to bring all the kids home.'' `` The Brady Bunch'' was the kind of television project that the networks squeezed until they got everything out of it. The original series ran on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 to'74. From 1972 to'74, `` The Brady Kids'' was an animated Saturday morning show on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Next, it was a variety show, `` The Brady Bunch Hour,'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. Then, in 1981 NBC telecast the movie `` The Brady Girls Get Married,'' followed by a brief series called `` The Brady Brides.'' The Brady Kids also put out a musical album. `` It's amazing,'' said <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. `` Someone brought a ` Brady Bunch' lunch pail for me to sign. They'd been offered $ 800 for it. I do n't know why the <LOCATION> Bradys </LOCATION> keep coming back. I went to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and they're popular there. `` I guess it's because they're a family that gets along and works out its problems. I think people get some help from it. I know when I was a child, seeing movie musicals saved my life. I was the youngest of 10 and we were poor. I could go to the theater and forget my childhood problems. It gives people something to strive for.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, who has four children, has been married for the past year to Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappas </PERSON>, a hypno-therapist. They live aboard a 70-foot yacht, The Big Flo, which is moored at <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> when they're not cruising. She has her own show on the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION>, `` Country Kitchen,'' and recently published a cookbook, `` A Little Cooking, a Little Talking and a Whole Lot of Fun.'' After the end of the `` Brady'' shows, she set a record for guest appearances on `` The Love Boat.'' She also was on an Afterschool Special and was a suspect on `` Murder, She Wrote.'' `` Working on a series forces you into a monastic way of life,'' she said. `` You work from early in the morning to late at night. I enjoyed it, but after the ` Bradys' I guess the right thing never came along. I do n't miss it.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said that although she's the host of a cooking show, it's the guests who do the cooking. `` It's a comedy and country music show with cooking,'' she said. `` I'd started in country music so it was interesting to get back to my roots. When I grew up in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, that was the music we had at home. I sang with a country band in high school. We have as guests people like <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to limit its runaway crude oil production have boosted crude futures sharply higher, but skepticism that the agreement would hold up in the long term has severely limited the gains. The accord, announced Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, sets a cartel-wide daily output ceiling of 18.5 million barrels, well under the estimated 22.5 million the cartel is pumping now. It also resolved a key issue in the talks by giving longstanding rivals <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> equal daily quotas of 2.64 million barrels. While oil traders cheered the pact, they remained skeptical about whether all 13 member countries of the oil cartel would adhere to it.

The market was closed Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Monday, the December contract for wholesale home heating oil soared 2.93 cents a gallon to 48.65 cents.

<HEAD>Banks Raise Prime Lending Rate; Now Highest Since Mid-1985</HEAD>

 Consumers with loans pegged to the prime interest rate can expect to see higher borrowing costs soon, but analysts are n't sure whether that will translate into tighter purse strings during the holiday season. The nation's biggest banks boosted their base lending rates by a half percentage point to 10.5 percent on Monday, the highest level since mid-1985 and the fourth boost this year. Many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recent weeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been rising due to inflation speculation and the dollar's weakness in foreign exchange. `` It comes as no surprise. In fact, they -LRB- banks -RRB- seem to have held back longer than I expected,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates of deposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining many types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, such as home equity loans. `` It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing costs in December or early next year,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But some economists said it was unclear whether the rate hike adversely would affect the economy, specifically consumer buying habits during the important holiday season. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON>, chief fixed-income strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think the direct effect is pretty small because generally consumers are n't affected by modest increases in interest rates ...'' But <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said some consumers might cut back on spending and `` buy only things that they can afford.'' `` There's an underlying sense of uneasiness because so many people have been through rough times even when the economy was strong. The prime rate hike coming into the Christmas season may make people more cautious,'' he said. The financial markets had no major reaction to Monday's announcement Stock and bond prices rose modestly, while the dollar firmed against other major currencies in foreign exchange. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the markets also are prepared for further increases in interest rates. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has warned of higher short-term rates unless lawmakers work to trim the huge federal budget deficit, a key factor in the recent weakening of the dollar. `` There's a building perception in the marketplace that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is, in fact, tightening conditions ...,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and other economists predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might soon raise its discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to banks, and if that happens, the banks might raise rates again. `` I'd look for something -LRB- from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in the next two weeks,'' said <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Manhattan </PERSON> was the first institution to announce the prime hike Monday and several other major banks joined the move. The prime stood at 8.5 percent at the beginning of this year and the banks have raised it four times since then. Monday's increase put the key lending rate at its highest level since May 20, 1985, when the banks lowered it a half percentage point to 10 percent.

<HEAD>Cargill Again Tops Forbes List of Largest Private Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The impact of the recent wave of leveraged buyouts is evident in Forbes magazine's list of the nation's 400 largest private companies, which was topped for the fourth straight year by commodities giant <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said in its Dec. 12 issue that 40 entries on the list were public companies that went private in 1988 _ compared with 21 on the list last year _ including such well known businesses as <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 revenue totaled $ 38.2 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> reports in its Dec. 12 issue. That was up nearly $ 6 billion, or 18 percent, from the previous year, and was more than double that of the second largest company on the list, <ORGANIZATION> Koch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, Kan.-based oil company that had sales of $ 16 billion. Continental Grain of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were tied for third with $ 13 billion in sales. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was fifth at $ 9.7 billion. Among those entering the list as a result of leveraged buyouts were Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>, ranked No. 6 with $ 8.5 billion in sales and the biggest newcomer to the rankings. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION>, Singer and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> were among other well-known companies that crossed the line into private ownership in 1988. Forbes based its list on revenues for fiscal 1987, some of which were reported by the companies and some of which were estimated by the magazine. Total revenue of the 400 companies rose 17 percent to $ 523 billion in 1988 from 1987, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. By comparison, combined sales for the 400 largest public companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose 7.4 percent in the past year to $ 2.6 trillion. A private company is one with no publicly traded common stock, either because it has too few common shareholders to file with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> or, if it files, its stock is unavailable to the general public. The number of people employed at <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> 400 private companies totaled 3.7 million, up 14 percent from last year's 3.2 million. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> leads the list with 170,000 employees. Service-oriented companies and those that turn over their assets rapidly had the largest representation on the list, including food wholesalers and grocery chains, apparel importers, commodity traders and real estate. Fifteen media and communications companies made the list, including <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Readers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Taubman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> were among several real estate companies on the list. <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> and Oppenheimer were among the securities brokerage houses on this year's top 400 ranking.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says the federal government has cleared its $ 12.6 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a deal that would make it the world's biggest consumer products company The tobacco and foods giant said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had declined to raise antitrust objections to the buyout. The lone remaining hurdle to the deal is obtaining sufficient shares under terms of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' $ 106-a-share tender offer, which it reaffirmed would expire at 5 p.m. EST Friday. The company said about 49.8 percent of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s estimated 119.3 million common shares and share equivalents had been tendered as of last Friday, and analysts said they had little doubt the takeover would be completed. Previously, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> valued the transaction at about $ 13.1 billion, but said Monday that it had has found there were fewer common shares and equivalents outstanding than it had expected. Nonetheless, the acquisition still would be the biggest buyout to date outside the oil business. Only the $ 13.4 billion takeover of Gulf Oil by what now is <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 was larger, and that could soon be surpassed as $ 20 billion-plus bids are being weighed for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said Monday the waiting period for the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s review of the proposed takeover had expired on Friday Asked the significance of that development, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said it meant the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had not challenged the deal. `` We can proceed with our tender offer,'' he said. Critics had argued that the size of the deal would hurt consumers by giving <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> too much influence over prices, supply systems and advertising time. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> statement. She said the commission had a policy of not commenting on such matters unless it blocked a merger or granted early termination of the required waiting period for antitrust review. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> rose 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 105.62 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> fell 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 95.37 -LCB-. The <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> deal would bring well-known <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> brands such as Miracle Whip salad dressing, Velveeta cheese, Sealtest ice cream and Tombstone frozen pizzas into the same corporate corral as Marlboro cigarettes, <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> cereals, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> meats and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> beer. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who follows the food business for the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the acquisition may result in improved distribution of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> products in secondary outlets where <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary is already strong. He said <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and General Foods products also may turn up more often in network television advertising as <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> uses its extra spending clout to drive harder bargains for ad time. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said consumers also may see <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> use coupons to guide consumers to its new products. `` You might buy a pound of Cracker Barrel cheese and get a coupon for Jello pudding, or buy <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> beer and get a free coupon for a Kraft snack,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. Despite the expansion of its food business, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> still will be chiefly a tobacco company. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the food, tobacco and beverage analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said non-tobacco businesses will contribute about 35 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' operating earnings, up from 25 percent without <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. The takeover agreement announced Oct. 31 would create the world's largest consumer products company, vaulting <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> past <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, the British-Dutch concern that had been the largest with 1987 sales of nearly $ 31 billion <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had $ 27.7 billion in sales in 1987, while <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had revenues of $ 9.9 billion, giving the combined company a theoretical total of $ 37.6 billion.

<TEXT>
 Beset by resurgent inflation, high interest rates and a record trade deficit, the British economic rebound that eight months ago was considered a miracle has turned into a problem for Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. In March, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was hailed as an economic wizard who had cured the British disease of high inflation, high unemployment and high interest rates. But last week, government figures showed the current account deficit had quadrupled to 2.43 billion pounds _ about $ 4.5 billion _ in October. The news prompted British banks to boost interest rates for the ninth time since June, rattling the stock market and raising the prospect of higher borrowing costs for consumers and industry. Now, the government's policies and <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s political future are being questioned, not only by such traditional critics the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but also by some members of <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` With Conservative MPs -LRB- Members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- grumbling about soaring mortgage costs and Labor convinced that the government at last is vulnerable over the handling of the economy, the gossip at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> has reached a fevered pitch,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote recently. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> is defending his strategy of using higher interest rates to choke off inflation, which Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says is her top economic priority. But critics say the strategy does not yet appear to be working, is a painful way to cure <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economic ills and could lead to a recession. Critics say the economic ills stem from the consumer boom sparked partly by tax cuts that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> announced in March. The sweeping tax cuts reduced the top income tax rate from 60 percent to 40 percent and the base rate from 27 percent to 25 percent. The higher interest rates are intended to fight inflation by discouraging that consumption, which fuels inflation and attracts imports, and to squeeze corporate profits by boosting the pound, thus discouraging inflationary pay raises. But the higher rates, which some economists say must go even higher before they will work, also mean a stronger pound, which hurts exports. Higher rates also boost mortgage costs, which helps increase inflation. Some economists say inflation, which was 3.3 percent in January, will top 8 percent. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> believes it will peak at 7 percent next year before falling back. The annual inflation rate now is about 6.4 percent. On Friday, addressing <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> businessmen, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the interest rate hike was `` a clear indication that this government is not prepared to take any risks with inflation.'' But he added: `` Interest rates do take time to have their full effect.'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> came under particularly sharp attack last Friday when the government announced the huge current account deficit. The ensuing interest rate increase brought the benchmark interest rate to 13 percent, its highest level in more than 3 -LCB- years. Stock prices plunged more than 2 percent Friday, and dipped another 0.7 percent on Monday, as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index. It marked the latest November turmoil for <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who with five years as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> head has held the office longer than any other since World War II. In his Nov. 1 autumn statement, an annual speech which is part of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s budgetary process, Lawsons new economic forecasts were sharply at odds with his previous predictions. Two weeks later, journalists quoted him as suggesting restricting government benefits for the elderly. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> denied the reports, but when challenged to check its tape recording of the remarks said its tape machine had malfunctioned. Conservative <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Biffen </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, said on <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> television that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> `` clearly has a problem of confidence'' and suggested he was in `` a very exposed position.'' The Financial Times discounted speculation that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was about to fall from grace, saying: `` The chancellor's misfortunes are in part simply a reflection of the unsustainable heights to which he was elevated earlier this year and of the notorious fickleness of some MPs and political commentators.''

Dealers attributed the dollar's rise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the increase Monday in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime interest rate from 10 percent to 10.5 percent, and the agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to reduce production. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> agreed to a daily production quota of 18.5 million barrels and a target price of $ 18 a barrel. The announcement triggered a $ 1-a-barrel increase in oil prices. But Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said the agreement's effect on exchange rates was mostly psychological and it would not immediately affect the world economy. <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar fell after its initial jump because speculators in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> had expected an increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime rate and its occurrence did not change market sentiment for a weaker dollar. `` Many market players still tend to think they should get rid of the dollar now,'' <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> added. An exchange dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously, said other traders were awaiting the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures for the July-September period, due later today, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for November, expected on Thursday. Meanwhile, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> regained 334.98 points, or 1.2 percent, to return to 29,318.30. On Monday, the index dropped 380.27 points, its largest one-day decline since Sept. 1. The index gained 79.53 points shortly after trading began Tuesday and advanced further in the afternoon, boosted by the stabilized currency market, dealers said. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares in active trading.

<HEAD>Bank Board To Consider Tying Reserve Funds To Financial Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators are writing new rules designed to make savings and loan failures less likely and let the government step in before losses get out of hand when an institution does go under. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the nation's 3,028 federally insured S & amp; Ls, on Monday proposed an `` early intervention'' plan that would permit it to install new management before an institution actually becomes insolvent It is also considering regulations requiring institutions with riskier real estate and commercial investments to hold more capital, or reserve funds, than institutions investing mostly in residential mortgages, the traditional mainstay of the thrift industry. The proposals `` seek to prevent problems before they arise and to resolve those that arise before they cost ... significant sums,'' bank board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said in a statement. A draft of the new rules will be formally issued in about two weeks by the board, which will allow 90 days for public comment before taking final action. Capital is the difference between an institution's loans and other assets and its deposits and other liabilities. An institution's losses come out of its capital. Thus, S & amp; Ls with more capital are less likely to fail and require rescue by the government deposit insurance fund. The industry's capital level has fallen dramatically during the 1980s. Early in the decade, high interest rates ate into profits. Later, the collapse of oil prices and Southwestern real estate pushed many <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls into the red. Critics say lax capital standards made the problem worse. Bank board officials say capital at the typical, or median, institution was 5.6 percent in 1980, fell to a low of 3.5 percent in 1984 and has since rebounded to 5.2 percent. The new risk-based rule would require capital of 8 percent by January 1993. The current goal is 6 percent, with no fixed date set for reaching that. The new policy also would permit regulators to take action when an institution's capital falls to 1.5 percent of assets, rather than wait until it disappears completely. Roughly 500 institutions are currently considered insolvent. At the end of September, an additional 269 would have been subject to bank board action under the 1.5 percent standard, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiechter </PERSON>, managing director for policy in the bank board's regulatory office The proposed new regulations would give institutions concentrating on residential mortgages a break, requiring only half as much capital for a home mortgage as for a commercial loan. It would require a fifth as much capital for mortgage-backed securities. However, the standard for direct investments in real estate, corporate stock and other ventures and for junk bonds is triple the standard for commercial loans. Also, institutions that borrow money by pledging their assets as collateral would have to raise more capital. If the mix of the industry's investments were to remain unchanged, the proposal would force a 25 percent increase in S & amp; Ls' capital, <PERSON> Fiechter </PERSON> said `` It will certainly be an incentive for thrifts to stay in their traditional business,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynyak </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an attorney with <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Conner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cuneo </PERSON>, which specializes in financial services law. The proposal is similar to rules adopted in August by commercial bank regulators. However, unlike the bank rules, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rules also require institutions more vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates to have more capital. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, said the industry recognizes the need for additional capital tied to risk. However, she said the bank board must adopt measures to encourage capital formation. `` The targets are certainly ... laudable as an ideal,'' she said. `` But, it's going to be a while before it's practical. You're not going to wave a magic wand and declare, ` Now there's capital.''' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an industry analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the prospect of increasing capital is poor because most S & amp; Ls' earnings are low and the market for their stock is depressed. `` Where do they -LRB- regulators -RRB- think the money is going to come from? ... I think they're going to have a lot of problems implementing this,'' he said. He added that the 269 institutions subject to action under the 1.5 percent threshold `` are going to scream bloody murder,'' increasing pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and regulators to grant exceptions from the rules.

<HEAD>Professor's Economic Reform Proposals For China Reach The Top</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An American professor who drafted proposed economic reforms for <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials said he expected little more than a handshake and photograph when he was summoned to meet with General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>, 53, a professor of economics and finance at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, found himself engaged in a frank discussion with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. The meeting lasted nearly 90 minutes and was reported on the front pages of Chinese newspapers and on television. The meeting occurred while <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who has lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1960, was visiting the <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province late this summer under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> was touring a railroad car factory when he received word that he was wanted in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but he did not learn until after his arrival in the capital that it was <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> who wished to speak with him. `` I thought it would be just 10 minutes _ shake hands, take your picture,'' he said Monday. Before leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>, the founder and former dean of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>'s business school, had mailed a copy of his economic proposals to Chinese leaders, not quite sure who would read the 17-page document. In case officials did not want to read the whole thing, he included a two-page summary. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said it was clear from his conversation with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> that the Chinese leader had read the entire document. `` That impressed me the most,'' he said. `` He was very interested.'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said he was told to speak his mind, and that the exchange `` sounded like a normal discussion between two economists.'' `` Basically I proposed that some state-run enterprises ultimately should be given to the people,'' said <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>. Production would increase if people were made responsible for a company's profits and losses, he said. Under the current system, he said, there is no incentive to go beyond quotas, and nobody is accountable because `` no one is the boss.'' Although private enterprise is permitted on a limited basis in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> that the government should take action to promote such activities. Entrepeneurs now proceed cautiously, he said, because they fear state intevention. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> also recommended that local government adopt rules and regulations protecting the property rights and interests of private owners. According to <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader agreed that provisions should be adopted to promote private enterprise. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> also quoted <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> as saying that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is already moving in the general direction he proposed, but that the government's actions must take into account society's ability to bear radical reforms. `` <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> believes that there is only so much that society can absorb at a time,'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said. The professor said he is cautiously optimistic that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be able to solve its economic problems. Unlike the situation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said, `` people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are fully aware that their future is tied to the success of economic reform.''

<TEXT>
 Share prices were slightly firmer in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at midday Tuesday with trading activity concentrated in a handful of the leading blue chip stocks, dealers said. The market was still recovering its confidence after Friday's announcement of a record 2.4 billion pound, or $ 4.5 billion, current account deficit for October and the subsequent rise in base lending raes to 13 percent, dealers said There were few economic developments Tuesday to give the market a firm direction, and trading was concentrated in a few stocks affected by special situations or takeover speculation, they said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 4.5 points, or 0.25 percent, at 1,786.9 at 12:46 p.m., below the day's high of 1,793.5, up 12.0, which came soon after the market's official 9 a.m. Volume was a modest 263.2 million shares, up from 185.4 million shares at the same time Monday. `` The market is still picking up the pieces after Friday's trade figures,'' one dealer said. `` The market is cheap enough not to sell shares, but it's not cheap enough to generate much buying.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has removed the chairman and two trustees supervising the $ 2.4 billion trust for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth control device after a complaint that they had shown bad judgment resulting in inaction and delays. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is supervising the bankruptcy proceeding of the <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday ordered the immediate removal of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claimants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locks </ORGANIZATION>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Samani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claimants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> did not outline his reasons for removing the trustees in his two-page order. But he noted that an opinion would be filed today in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, headquarters of <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, manufacturer of the Dalkon Shield. The complaint by claimaints in the case against <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> contended the trustees used poor judgement in voting to retain as counsel the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Cadwalader </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wickersham </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, which represents the separate <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claimants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> disqualified the firm from representing the trust. The complaint also accused the trustees of taking steps seen as being confrontational toward <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>'s supervision of their work. The ousted trustees were among five appointed under <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' bankruptcy plan to set up a method for compensating victims of the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in 1985 after hundreds of women filed suit claiming the birth control device had killed some women and injured scores of others. Under the reorganization plan, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> would be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and would put $ 2.3 billion in cash into the trust. In September, lawyers representing more than 100 claimants asked for removal of the trustees, arguing that they were inexperienced and had not moved quickly enough to set up a claims center. The lawyers also charged thatMs. <PERSON> Samani </PERSON>'s presence on the board presented a conflict of interest. Ms. <PERSON> Samani </PERSON> said she was among the women injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, manufactured in the early 1970s by <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>. She withdrew her claim to serve as a trustee. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>'s order permits her to reinstate her claim The remaining trustees, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON>, will nominate successors.

<TEXT>
 Indications that quota-cheating would continue despite <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new production-limiting agreement sparked a selloff that sharply reduced the gains posted in crude oil prices when the pact was reached. The uncertainty was sparked when the oil minister of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, said the daily production ceiling set by the pact for his country `` does not represent its official quota.'' <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>'s comments, reported by the official emirates news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAM </ORGANIZATION>, were interpreted as a warning his country might pump more than its quota of 988,000 barrels a day. Violations of previous quotas have caused chaos on the oil market and a sharp decline in prices. But on arrival today in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> was quoted as saying his country was committed to the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> accord ratified Monday. `` We are committed to the text and spirit of the accord we signed,'' <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` The U.A.E. signed the accord, and it remains committed to what it stipulated regarding the production ceiling, the production quotas and pricing.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, traded as high as $ 15.80 a barrel before settling at $ 15.03 on Monday, up $ 1.06 from Wednesday's close. The market was closed Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Each $ 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although oil companies do not necessarily pass along the full increase. The new agreement by the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, effective Jan. 1, aims to curb the cartel's recent breakneck production, reduce the world oil glut and drive up crude prices. The accord's success hinges on whether all member countries honor the quotas set out for them. Analysts said they expected quota cheating by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, which is believed to be ignoring its current <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota. The country has a new quota of 988,000 barrels a day, a gain from 948,000 barrels. Analysts estimate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> already has been producing as much as 2 million barrels a day. They say it is unlikely it will reduce its output to less than 1.2 million barrels a day. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON>, an analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the new agreement was likely to hold, even with cheating by the emirates. `` As long as that is all, they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- wo n't fare too badly,'' <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON> said. The production agreement was fashioned in nearly two weeks of meetings by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers. Under the pact, the cartel would limit production in the first six months of next year to 18.5 million barrels a day, up from its current official ceiling of 16.6 million barrels but down sharply from its actual production, estimated at 22.5 million barrels a day. It also retains <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. The new deal also brings <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the quota system. That nation refused to join the current accord, arranged in 1986, because it wanted the same, larger production ceiling as its war rival <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The ministers stepped up efforts to set a new quota for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed in August to a cease-fire in their 8-year war. The two countries now badly need additional oil revenue to rebuild their damaged economies. After lengthy behind-the-scenes negotiations, the ministers gave both the same 2.64 million barrels a day quota. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had a cap of 2.4 million barrels under the old agreement and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 1.5 million. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 Strike-bound suburban commuters crowded into scarce buses or drove their cars on jammed expressways today, while the government ordered out army trucks to move stranded passengers. The strike called by the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> halted all trains on two of the four regional express networks and disrupted subway and bus routes. The first army vehicles were expected to arrive in the capital late today with as many as 400 expected to be on hand for Wednesday morning's rush hour, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> announced the military intervention on national television Monday night and accused the union of waging `` a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment. This is not in the French union tradition.'' <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> said strikers blocked buses in their terminals, flattened tires and sabotaged engines. The transit agency's management was being ordered to stop paying striking workers and to start disciplinary proceedings against lawbreakers, he said General Confederation of Labor Secretary-General <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON> said on French radio today that the government was mistaken if it planned to solve the labor dispute `` with police, troops or military trucks.'' At midday today, the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> regional transit agency reported the regional A and B lines halted, only 60 percent of buses operating and service reduced by up to 25 percent on some subway lines. Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s Socialist government has been hit by striking nurses, postal employees, government office workers and other public service employees demanding wage increases that <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> says would be inflationary. `` The real motive of these strikes is political,'' the conservative newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> said in today's editorial. `` The Communists are trying to exert unbearable pressure on the Socialists with a view toward the municipal elections of next March.'' The Communist share in recent French elections slipped to less than 10 percent of the total vote. But the party appears to see a chance to grab the role of the only authentic leftist force, as the Socialists continue the economic policies of the conservatives who controlled the government from 1986 until last May. <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON> dismissed repeated suggestions that the strikes were intended to increase Communist chances in next year's municipal elections as `` completely stupid.'' His union is demanding increased safety measures and across-the-board pay increases of $ 170 a month. The transit authority Sunday offered raises of $ 42.50 a month. A typical transit worker earns a top-scale monthly wage of $ 1,400. The two regional express lines paralyzed since Monday usually carry more than 600,000 of the roughly 10 million people who commute to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by bus, train or car.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employee will get his day in court on an age-discrimination lawsuit against the company under a ruling by a federal appeals court. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday that the case should have gone to trial and ordered the case back to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, which had granted <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> a summary judgment in the suit by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. White was fired in 1986 at age 51 from his engineering position as part of a <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> plan to reduce its staff by up to 10 percent, according to court records. Of the nine employees in White's department, two were older than White. White had worked for <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> for 29 years and nine months. He contends <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> chose him for termination because if he had remained on the job three more months, he would have been eligible for more retirement benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> maintained that he was chosen because of low performance ratings and because his position was the most expendable.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will end passenger car production at its <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisc. </LOCATION>, plant on Dec. 23 putting about 5,300 people out of work, a spokesman for the automaker says. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said Monday that the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant would retain a work force of about 1,200 people, including 200-250 salaried workers, in the engine operation at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> once the car assembly lines shut down. The <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant now has about 6,500 employees, including 600 salaried workers. `` After Dec. 23, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will stop building passenger cars in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said. `` Obviously there will be people needed after Dec. 23 in the L-body tear-down operation and workers will also be needed to dismantle the M-body tooling.'' The M-body production is being discontinued by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, while the L-body production is being shifted to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Jefferson Avenue plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> had announced earlier this year that auto production at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> would stop by the end of this year. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Steagall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 72 </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, said he thinks <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is making a serious mistake by shutting down the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> car production. `` The quality levels and the sales levels are there'' for both the L-body and the M-body lines, he said. He said the union was preparing for the assembly shutdown.

<TEXT>
 The nation's economy grew at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, tempered by the summer drought, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the performance of the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy, slowed in the July-September period after expanding at an annual rate of 3.2 percent during the first six months of the year. It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, when the economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate. The department said that without the drought third-quarter growth would have been a strong 3.2 percent. The report, however, represents an upward revision from a preliminary estimate last month, which pegged growth at 2.2 percent. The revisions were about in line with economists' expectations and fit in with anticipation in the market that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will soon move to curb inflation by dampening growth with higher interest rates. Major banks raised their prime lending rates on Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported today that corporate profits rose a slight 0.2 percent in the third quarter, to $ 163.1 billion, the worst performance since a loss in the last quarter of 1987. In another report Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the imbalance between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and exports narrowed to $ 28.53 billion in the July-September quarter, a 5.4 percent decline. It was the third straight quarterly drop. Through the first nine months of the year, the deficit ran at an annual rate of $ 125.2 billion, compared with last year's record $ 160.3 billion deficit. Analysts predicted the deficit for all of 1988 should be at least 20 percent lower than 1987, marking the first time since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981 that the trade deficit has improved. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policymakers have relied heavily on the dollar's decline in value over the last three years to increase exports by making them more affordable abroad, and thus help ease the trade deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report suggested the strategy has been at least partly successful, easing some pressure for the dollar to decline more. Another event that helped the dollar Monday was an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries accord aimed at limiting production and raising the price of oil, which often is priced in dollars. Higher <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prices raise demand for dollars to pay for the oil. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pact reached in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, was viewed skeptically by many industry analysts, given the cartel's history of violating its own agreements, but it still pushed oil prices up more than $ 1 to the $ 15-a-barrel level. Meanwhile, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks boosted their prime lending rates a half percentage point to 10.5 percent, the steepest level since mid-1985 and the fourth rise this year. The prime rate rise had been widely expected, but some analysts said it also contributed to a strengthened dollar, which rose in value against the Japanese yen, British pound, West German mark and other key currencies. The dollar's strength helped the bond market, where the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose about $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield fell to 9.14 percent from 9.17 percent Friday. But the impact was hardly felt on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the numbers of gaining and losing issues were about even in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.76 to 2,081.44, and broader market indicators were mixed.

 A multimillion-dollar lawsuit has been filed against a Greek banker accused in his homeland of embezzling more than $ 135 million and jailed in this country on a fugitive warrant. The civil racketeering lawsuit seeking at least $ 34 million was filed Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the bank's former chairman. If the bank can prove the racketeering allegation to a jury, it could seek three times the amount of damages claimed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedarbaum </PERSON> froze at least $ 30 million of <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' assets in accounts at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> pending a hearing Dec. 6. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, where he had been indicted on five counts of fraud and embezzlement alleging he siphoned more than $ 135 million from the bank. The scandal has embarrassed the government of Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and prompted the resignations of two government ministers. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, 34, had been ordered to remain in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> while officials investigated alleged irregularities at the bank. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Papadatos </PERSON>, temporary commissioner appointed by the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government to investigate the case, said in a report that <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> used bank money for $ 200 million in loans without collateral and gifts to soccer clubs, athletes, business associates, journalists and friends. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was arrested by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents last Wednesday when he arrived on a private jet at a small airport outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer has said his client came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for safety reasons. The lawyer, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON>, declined to comment on the civil suit when reached in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, saying he had n't seen the court papers. Also named in the suit were <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, and his brother, <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, a Greek citizen. The three were accused of forming a racketeering enterprise that looted the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> of millions. <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was not arrested with her husband Wednesday although she was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; he refused to divulge her whereabouts. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney Victor A. Wild said <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> remained jailed without bail pending extradition proceedings. Court papers said <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> and his family had been reported to be in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was suspended Oct. 20 as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. He had acquired a controlling interest in the privately owned bank in 1984 after working in its <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> branch for two years as an accountant. He also built a publishing empire and bought a controlling interest in an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> soccer club. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year on a 1980 federal fraud conspiracy indictment but a judge later dismissed the case, now under appeal by prosecutors.

<HEAD>Big Inventories, Production Increases Mean New Incentives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The math is simple: when too many new cars are built and too few are sold, incentives result. Auto analysts say the latest round will arrive in time for Christmas. `` We're going to have to have some type of programs,'' analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said Monday. `` The companies would much rather give away part of the gross profit than cut production.'' Auto giant <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may have a 100-day backlog of cars by the end of December, an inventory nearly 50 percent larger than considered comfortable. `` If you just look at the recent reactions of the car companies to inventory bulges, it's obvious they will do something,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. `` Incentives of varying proportions and programs have been part of the landscape for four years now.'' Each of the Big Three have incentives in effect. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s incentives programs have no set expiration; many of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s programs are set to expire Dec. 5, while some <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> programs expire <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, in the best shape of the Big Three as far as inventories go, plans to build more cars in the first quarter of 1989 than it announced two weeks ago. Its latest production schedule for the first three months of 1989 shows 501,000 cars to be built compared with 475,000 announced a few weeks ago. `` In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, it is losing some sales because of a lack of certain models, especially the Probe and the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That's an up side, but there's not very much good about this.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has begun trimming some first quarter production schedules, <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. Whether the incentives will take the form of cash, interest rate discounts or other, more exotic lures is a closely guarded industry secret. `` They've got a bookshelf full of these programs, guys whose only job it is to dream up new programs,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. `` What they'll basically do is what has worked best in the past for specific models. The prime interest rate rose by half a percentage point Monday to 10.5 percent at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks. The prime rate is what banks charge their best customers to borrow money, and the new rate means consumers will pay more to finance a new car. `` If a dealer offers a guy an $ 800 rebate on a new car and he goes to the bank and finds out the interest rate is 13 \ percent, the buyer may walk away,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said `` It might be smarter to say ` The car costs this much. We'll give it to you at 7.9 percent interest.'''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> found no takers among 15 third parties it asked to buy the company on friendly terms after <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> launched its takeover bid, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders says. `` They have surveyed the world and they have n't come up with anything better than what Grand Met is offering,'' attorney <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambronne </PERSON> said Monday. `` The game is over. They need to redeem their -LRB- poison -RRB- pill or negotiate with Grand Met,'' he said. <PERSON> Cambronne </PERSON> said the failed attempt to find a friendly suitor is confirmed in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing in which <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> says it has abandoned the search. He commented after a <ORGANIZATION> Hennepin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing at which Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> took under advisement renewed arguments from the shareholders' group on its request to have the poison pill invalidated, force <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate with Grand Met and block the planned spinoff. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> to force Grand Met to put its best offer on the table so <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> can accept or reject it, <PERSON> Cambronne </PERSON> said. Grand Met, meanwhile, on Monday extended for the fifth time its $ 60 a share, all-cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock. The tender offer now will expire at midnight EST Friday unless extended again. By Saturday, 85.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares had been tendered and not withdrawn, Grand Met said. The liquor, gambling and specialty products conglomerate launched its $ 5.23 billion hostile takeover bid Oct. 4. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors has rejected it as inadequate and has refused to meet with Grand Met Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s investment bankers valued the company at $ 62 to $ 78 a share in mid-October, said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachnoff </PERSON>, one of the shareholders' attorneys Standing in the way of a takeover are <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s poison pill defense and a plan to spin off its Burger King subsidiary into a separate company. Grand Met and dissident <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are suing the food and restaurant company to invalidate the poison pill and prevent the spinoff. Burger King Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> will be questioned Thursday for five hours in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by attorneys for the shareholders and Grand Met as part of the litigation, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully we'll find out more about the -LRB- Burger King -RRB- plan,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochrane </PERSON>, an attorney for the shareholders. Grand Met has said a separate Burger King would create a huge tax liability for Grand Met if the takeover is successful. In addition, Burger King franchisees have announced opposition to the plan, saying it would add too much debt to the already troubled fast-food chain. The poison pill, or shareholders' rights plan, would make the acquisition prohibitively expensive and the tender offer is conditioned on its removal, Grand Met has said.

 Stock prices were marginally higher in early trading today as the government's report on the gross national product had little impact on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 3.91 to 2,085.35 as of 10 a.m. EST.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was light, with 16.68 million shares changing hands after the first 30 minutes of trading. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the economy, as measured by the GNP, expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter.

<HEAD>Engineering Firms Settle in WPPSS Trial; One Defendant Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two engineering firms that designed two abandoned <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Power Supply System nuclear power plants have agreed to a $ 25 million cash settlement to get themselves out of the WPPSS securities fraud trial. <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a court-appointed settlement master in the case, announced the settlement Monday as the trial resumed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court here. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constructors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 14.8 million and $ 7.2 million, respectively, to former <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bondbuyers who bought into <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' proposal in the late 1970s to build two nuclear power plants in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> also will pay up to $ 3 million in cash if the plaintiffs recover less than that in disputed claims against <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION>'s insurance carriers. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> agreed to surrender part of at least $ 50 million in disputed insurance claims that the company may recover. A class of 24,000 plaintiffs sued more than 100 original defendants after <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted in 1983 on $ 2.25 billion in municipal bonds sold to build the plants. The plaintiffs claim <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, 88 public utility districts, and others conspired to lie and hide information that might have discouraged investors. Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> signed an order severing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> from the suit, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the securities firm that acted as financial adviser to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, as the only remaining defendant in the case. Including the latest settlement, the original defendants have agreed to pay about $ 675 million plus funds recovered from insurance claims. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> still must approve the settlements. He has not yet scheduled hearings on approval testimony. Plaintiff attorney <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> called the settlement `` a fair compromise of our claims.'' He said he was taking into account the previous settlements and `` the desire to get money to our clients as quickly as possible.'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said he no longer was talking with <PERSON> Blyth </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> attorneys about settlement possibilities. After the jury was reseated for the first time in more than a week, he instructed members to attach no significance to settlement talk. As he had done when two earlier settlements were announced, he did not tell the jury the provisions of the agreement between the engineering firms and the plaintiff. Testimony resumed with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Hank </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosmata </PERSON>'s 24th trial day on the witness stand Plaintiff attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> asked Kosmata why several issues were not included in bond-sale documents called official statements, which were given to potential bond investors. <LOCATION> Kosmata </LOCATION>, the liaison with the utilities in the project, rejected <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s suggestions that concerns about how construction budgets were compiled might have been of interest to potential investors. He said the important issue was that the budgets were approved, not that `` preliminary'' concerns about them were expressed. <PERSON> Kosmata </PERSON> also reaffirmed earlier testimony that he heard no one suggest presenting test litigation in court to see if the utilities had authority to commit themselves to the project. That authority was lacking, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1983, and the agreements to pay off the bonds could not be enforced. That ruling led to the bond default. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> introduced a 1983 affidavit of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, an attorney for Bonners Ferry -LRB- <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> -RRB- Municipal Utility, saying the issue of test litigation regarding the authority was discussed at a May 1975 meeting before the utilities agreed to the project. <PERSON> Kosmata </PERSON> said he attended that meeting and heard no discussions about a test case. `` I came away with a firm feeling there was no problem,'' he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Asbestos Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> has lost its bid to force the federal government to assume some of the liability for suits over asbestos pipe material the company manufactured for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to a decision by a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that the government enjoyed sovereign immunity and thus was immune to lawsuits for negligence from use of asbestos products `` Obviously we're disappointed, but it will in no way affect our other pending lawsuits against the government,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION> representative. <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION>, which has been inundated with damage claims from people who say they suffer from cancer and asbestosis because of their exposure to asbestos in the company's pipe compound, has similar negligence suits pendiing against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in federal courts in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We think as conflicts develop between the courts, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear one of these cases,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. During the military buildup that followed World War II, <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION> was enlisted by the government to make a pipe joint compound containing asbestos for use in ship-building. Asbestos was found to be linked to a number of respiratory ailments and <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON> <PERSON> Picher </PERSON> quit making the asbestos-laden compound in the early 1970s. Claims filed against the company by shipyard workers and their families seek damages totaling in the millions of dollars. <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION> contends the federal government should bear some responsibility for the asbestos-related claims because it mandated the use of the product and routinely violated its own occupational safety and health rules. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> insisted on the use of asbestos insulation aboard ships. It alone knew the extent of the danger and told no one,'' the company wrote in a position paper supporting its arguments. `` Companies, enlisted in the war effort, were told precisely the formula for the insulation and how much asbestos fiber it had to contain. ... The problem was created by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> itself for it set the rules for handling the material and then broke them without notice or warning,'' the company said. While challenging the government position in court, <ORGANIZATION> Eagle-Picher </ORGANIZATION> is also trying to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass laws making the government liable. The company got legislation introduced in the last session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would override the doctrine of sovereign immunity and make the government accountable for actions and decisions just as other employers who control working conditions that affect workers' health are The legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON>, a Republican, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, a Democrat, both of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The measure had 70 co-sponsors.

<HEAD>Prime Rejects Buyout Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced today that its board of directors has unanimously rejected a $ 20-per-share buyout bid by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A release by the computer company called the offer by <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of MAI, `` inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. The board recommended that Prime stockholders reject the offer and not tender their shares in response to the MAI offer. Prime Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said the board considered several factors, including Prime's business and financial condition, its future prospects, recommendations from the company's financial advisers and the recent value of its stock. Prime Computer stock opened on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> this morning at $ 15 -LCB- per share. Board members also noted that Prime's next annual meeting scheduled for May 12, 1989 comes before the expiration of MAI's offer According to the Prime directors, the current market price of Prime common stock reflects the negative effects of the costs and expenses associated with the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION>. On the other hand, the company expects belt-tightening measures in certain areas to improve near-term and long-term operating results of the company and increase values for stockholders. `` We believe the unsolicited $ 20 offer by Choice fails to recognize either the intrinsic value of the company today or the long-term values achievable by the company for all its stockholders.'' Financier <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> heads MAI, which is a much smaller computer business than Prime. Prime is second to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the field of computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. Prime acquired <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> in February for $ 435 million. There has been some speculation that <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> undertook the takeover attempt to induce Prime to buy his company instead, in what is commonly called a Pac Man defense of acquiring the suitor. MAI Basic, a small concern based in <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, owns 4.1 percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares outstanding and is offering $ 20 a share for the rest in a tender offer to the shareholders. The offer, valued at $ 970 million, was made Nov. 15.

 <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of information about the software that runs <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframe computers, arbitrators announced today. The arbitrators' decision ends years of dispute between <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest computer company, and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest computer maker, over precious information about the internal workings of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe computers. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> a total $ 237 million and tens of millions of dollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plan devised by the arbitration team. Today's announcement is the biggest development in the IBM-Fujitsu controversy since September 1987, when arbitrators announced the initial resolution of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s charges that <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> illegally copied <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> software. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price, which had jumped $ 2.87 -LCB- a share on Monday in expectations of a big payment from <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, edged back 62 -LCB- cents to $ 118.25 a share by late morning today. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had been holding secret hearings since then to work out the ground rules under which <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> must grant <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> access to information about the software that runs <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframe computers. The rules set by the two arbitrators will make it possible for <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> to develop complex, expensive software that controls the basic operations of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframe computers. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which dominates the world market for mainframe computers, is the only company making the so-called operating system software for its own machines. The information supplied by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also will make it easier for <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> to develop its own line of mainframe computers that compete with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s by running the same programs. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> are <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s two main competitors in that market. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> is not covered by the terms of the IBM-Fujitsu deal. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> issued brief statement today saying they were satisfied with the results of the arbitration. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> first accused <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 of illegally copying its mainframe software. The companies reached a private settlement in 1983, but the vaguely worded agreement fell apart and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 asked to have the dispute settled by binding arbitration. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to let the arbitrators supervise all disputes growing out of the case until the year 2002. The arbitrators are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mnookin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a computer expert who is a retired executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Details of their $ 237 million-plus payout plan include <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> providing <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> $ 396 million for a paid-up license on use of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> programs covered under the 1983 agreement, of which <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> already has paid $ 125 million. The arbitrators said <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> also was entitled to a refund of $ 34 million out of the $ 471 million it had paid <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> under the 1983 agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> had made an intial payment of $ 65 million and semi-annual payments of $ 406 million that ended last year. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> between $ 26 million and $ 51 million in 1989 for the right to examine information about <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframe software. The amount depends on how much material <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> uses. For years after 1989 the arbitrators will decide how much <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> must pay <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after opening slightly lower. The wheat market got a bit of a boost on prospects for a pickup in export sales and in response to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report indicating an increase in export shipments last week, analysts said. Corn was up slightly on buying by traders who had sold borrowed contracts earlier, and soybeans were little changed. Analysts said the opening sell-off, like the previous day's sharp decline, seemed tied to disappointment that the U.S.-Soviet grain deal signed Monday was only a 27-month extension of a 5-year pact that expired on Sept. 30. `` I think we're getting, in all these markets, some general disappointment that the grain agreement really did n't have anything new to offer from the old agreement,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.19 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.58 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.02 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with January at $ 7.49 -LCB- a bushel. Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while pork futures were mostly higher. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December at 73.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with January at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent lower to .45 cent higher with December at 40 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .48 cent higher with February at 43.22 cents a pound. Cattle settled lower on Monday and pork futures finished higher.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stockholders are facing another moment of reckoning, either to sell their shares and make a windfall profit or to sit tight for the next unpredictable chapter in history's biggest corporate takeover battle. A company-imposed deadline for a second round of multibillion-dollar bids to buy the food and tobacco conglomerate was scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today, and no decisions were expected before Wednesday. Speculation that new, fatter offers would emerge pushed <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price up $ 1 a share Monday to $ 89, more than 50 percent above its value before the takeover saga began two months ago. The stock rose another 87 -LCB- cents by late this morning in heavy trading. At least two of the three known bidders _ an <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management group and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ were working on revised proposals, according to people familiar with the bidding process. There was no indication Monday whether the third contender, a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, planned to alter its bid, which in the first round was considered the riskiest but potentially the richest. A special committee of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s outside directors, conducting the auction for the nation's 19th largest industrial company, declined comment on whether any additional bidders had emerged. But officials of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> had said previously that the structure for evaluating all offers would remain unchanged from the first round, which took place Nov. 18-20. In that process, proposals were submitted in secret to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm representing the special committee, followed by a analysis of what they were worth and an announcement of the committee's intentions The outside directors extended the auction after the first round ended, reflecting their view that those proposals were inadequate in substance and price. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s management offered $ 100 a share in cash and securities for a total of about $ 22.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 94 a share in cash and securities, or $ 21.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> said it might offer $ 105 to $ 118 a share in cash and securities, or $ 23.8 billion to $ 26.8 billion. Wall Street strategists speaking on condition they not be identified said there was a widespread presumption that the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management group and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> would have to raise their previous offers to at least match the potential worth of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> proposal. Of the three bidders, the most uncertainty surrounded <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, which in its original offer proposed using a tax loophole that expires at the end of this year to raise the value of its offer above the others. Under the original plan, the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> group would buy <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s tobacco business with a so-called installment note, which would not be subject to a capital gains tax for a number of years, thereby giving the firm additional money to pay shareholders a fatter price. But that part of the transaction would have to be completed by Dec. 31 because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> closed the loophole on this capital-gains deferment, leaving many tax experts skeptical about whether <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was realistic. The struggle for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> began in late October when the management group led by its chairman, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said it was considering a debt-financed acquisition of the company, maker of hundreds of products ranging from <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> cigarettes to <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> canned fruits. The amount and heavy use of borrowed money in the takeover plans so far have dwarfed all records and incited critical scrutiny of such debt-financed deals. In recent years, such deals have enriched many investors but raised questions about the economic impact of the additional debt load on the companies.

 Stock prices drifted aimlessly today after the government's report on the gross national product had little impact on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fluctuated in a narrow range through the morning, and was up 4.26 to 2,085.70 as of noon EST. Declining issues were neck-and-neck with advancers, with 626 stocks falling, 619 rising and 526 unchanged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Among broader indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index of all its listed stocks was up 0.16 to 151.41, while the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s market value index slipped 0.43 to 291.24. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled a light 51.13 million shares by midday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the economy, as measured by the GNP, expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter. That was up from the government's preliminary estimate last month of 2.2 percent growth, but below the 2.9 percent to 3 percent expected by Wall Street, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Spending time at the mall has been raised to an art form by some high school students, but at <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> it's a management science. The school has just produced its first two graduates in shopping center management, and the trainees are finding a bull market for their specialized skills. `` It was kind of my destiny that I showed up and they had the major,'' said <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a former administrative assistant to a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shopping mall manager and one of the first to earn a mall degree. `` Ever since I started at the mall in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, I knew shopping malls were never going to die,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 24, who worked 2 -LCB- years for mall developer <ORGANIZATION> Melvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The study of malls _ and how to run them _ leads to a bachelor of science degree in business administration at <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>. Before the university started the program, shopping center management was mostly taught in seminars offered to established shopping mall developers by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON>, spokesman for the group. `` This is a major move by a school. There are n't many institutions that talk about shopping malls at all,'' said <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON>. The industry has had three years of record growth with 21 regional malls of at least 400,000 square feet _ each the size of 10 football fields _ built last year, <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said. He said that overall, construction began on 1,846 new shopping centers last year. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said the council is helping develop training programs for graduate students at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're looking for somebody to professionalize the development and management of centers, in this case,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in training shopping mall managers began in 1985 when developers offered to help train managers for the growing field, said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Diederick </PERSON>, a business professor who directs the shopping center major. `` They've been very supportive and they've been a major source of expertise. They've served as lecturers and have been very helpful in placing our students,'' he said. Among those offering to help train the students were the locally based <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeBartolo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cafaro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ two of the country's largest shopping center developers. The major, which has attracted 25 students this year, requires business school students to take courses in the history and planning of retail sales, shopping center operations and problems surrounding development, <PERSON> Diederick </PERSON> said. He said students are also required to work at internships with developers. `` We draw on property management concepts that are n't really talked about in other courses,'' said <PERSON> Diederick </PERSON> in describing what sets the course apart from other business programs. `` A mall is much like a city, and they -LRB- the students -RRB- have to have a lot of those skills,'' said the professor. Among the topics students explore are police science, engineering and traffic control, <PERSON> Diederick </PERSON> said. `` The shopping center industry has grown dramatically and it has gotten to the point that education has to be specific to that industry,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richley </PERSON>, director of operations for <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON>. About 55 percent of all retail dollars spent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year went to stores in shopping malls, <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said. He said that with that figure growing at half a percent a year, the council projects sharply increased demand from shopping center owners for trained managers. Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, for instance, said she is weighing job offers from <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON>, as well as several other shopping center developers. And she said that until other business schools start to copy <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s program, she does n't expect much competition for the jobs she wants. `` Right now during this period there is no way you can get a view of what the industry is about in any other classroom setting,'' she said.

 The problems of attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON>, who farms a small parcel east of here, show how difficult it's getting to balance the interests of agriculture and development in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Residents in the area complain about dust, noise, bugs and traffic congestion caused by slow-moving tractors, while farmers suffer from vandalism to farm and irrigation equipment and trash from weekend picnickers. Repeated complaints by neighbors finally forced <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> to change his cropping patterns. `` We just do n't grow cotton on our ranch anymore. The conflicts are just too severe,'' he said. Rapid growth in the fertile <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, locked between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, may eventually ruin farming in what is regarded as the world's richest agricultural region. A <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> study shows as many as 50,000 acres of productive crop land in the state are paved over or removed from production each year because of urbanization. Air pollution primarily brought on by heavy vehicle traffic is making serious cuts in production of some crops, such as grapes, according to <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, a panelist at a recent discussion here sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can preserve the land, but if we ca n't preserve the production, what good is it?'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said of the air pollution issue. `` If we do n't do some planning and take care of some of the obvious shortfalls, it's going to be too late.'' About 815,000 acres of farm land will be lost in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> between now and the year 2000, estimated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, a former assemblyman who sponsored the state's strong farmland conservation measures in the early 1960s. `` All efforts now being made are inadequate for the purpose of protecting farm land,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafroth </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that current preservation efforts are inadequate but said public officials have a number of tools available to spare crop lands from a layer of fresh asphalt. <PERSON> Shafroth </PERSON> called for strict land-use regulations to prevent `` leap-frog'' development, or housing subdivisions and industrial parks situated in the middle of productive fields. Such development in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Natomas </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has led to the demise of once-productive rice farms. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, planning and development director for <LOCATION> Tulare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said planners must regard agriculture as an industry when examining housing development proposals. `` Just as locating a residence in an industrial park leads to conflict and does not make sense, locating a residence in the middle of an agricultural area does not make sense,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Rural residential growth right now in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is the greatest threat to preservation of farm land,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The practice of splitting off small parcels of the farm so family members can build homes or `` rural ranchettes'' is a common way development encroaches on agriculture, he said. <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> said his farm ca n't use certain chemicals because of the nearby homes, and the materials he does use can only be applied by ground spray rigs, not by aerial cropdusters. To keep developers at bay, farmers are being encouraged to retain their land when inflated prices make selling out a lucrative option. The sale of development rights to public agencies is another option. Under such agreements, a public agency pays a farm owner the difference between the farm land's current and potential value for housing or other urban uses. When development rights are conveyed, future development is restricted in the property deed, but the farmer retains ownership of the land. A similar concept is used to acquire land in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> basin to stop excessive development and improve environmental quality. While financing such a program is unclear, officials have suggested such options as bond issues, taxes on sales of converted farm land, or local taxing districts.

<HEAD>Honeywell To Sell Colorado Semiconductor Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it plans to sell its semiconductor operation in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Colo. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> unit manufactures custom and semi-custom integrated circuits for the computer merchant market, as well as for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s internal needs and select military customers. `` The decision to sell the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> operation is consistent with our desire to concentrate on our core businesses,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer. `` With the divestiture of the computer business at the end of 1986 and actions since then to focus on our leadership position in controls, we no longer need such an extensive facility for circuits used internally, nor is it in our strategic interest to be in the merchant chip business,'' <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> added. `` Except for highly proprietary circuits, most of our semiconductor needs can be satisfied on the outside,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> operation is part of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, which also includes a research and development facility in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> had previously said it intended to restructure the division to fit the company's strategic direction. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> said it would maintain the Plymouth facility as a modest captive operation. It will transfer a limited number of fabrication technologies and products from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> to aid in meeting future internal and military customer requirements for proprietary integrated circuits. The company is seeking a buyer who will also continue to support external customers and also <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s internal requirements during a transition period. About 1,100 employees work in the four-building <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> complex and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> said it expects employees to transfer to the new owner at the time of sale.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar retreated against most major currencies in European trading Tuesday, buffeted by a lower-than-expected growth rate for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Gold prices also slipped. Currency dealers said a revision of the third-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product _ the broadest measure of economic health _ to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent prompted dollar selling. Most traders said they had anticipated growth of at least 3 percent during the July-September period. The British pound, however, remained strong. The currency was helped by last week's boost in bank base interest rates by one percentage point to 13 percent. Dealers said Monday's increase by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks of their prime lending rates, to 10.5 percent from 10 percent, was n't a sufficient incentive for the markets to switch from pounds to dollars. British rates are now the highest of all leading Western economies, making the pound one of the more attractive currencies. Dealers said the British central bank intervened to sell some pounds for dollars Tuesday in an attempt to slow sterling's gain. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8425, more expensive for buyers than Monday's $ 1.8385. Other late rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Monday's late rates: 1.7285 West German marks, down from 1.7332; 1.4481 Swiss francs, down from 1.4515; 5.9125 French francs, down from 5.9225; 1.9530 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9547; 1,281.25 Italian lire, down from 1,285.50; and 1.1930 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1918. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 122.15 Japanese yen, up from 122.00. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar traded lower at 121.65 yen. Gold bullion prices were around a dollar lower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after rising earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major European trading center for the precious metal, gold closed at $ 422.75 a troy ounce, down from $ 423.85. The Zurich closing price was $ 422.25 an ounce, down from $ 423.25. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gold closed at a bid $ 423.31 an ounce, up from $ 422.02.

<TEXT>
 New construction contracts rose slightly in October after a three-month slump, on the strength of residential building everywhere except in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, a business-research company reported Tuesday. The F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said that new construction projects last month were up 1 percent to an annualized value of $ 240.2 billion. Construction contracts fell 3 percent in September, following drops in the previous two months. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> economist, said that while the October improvement was welcome, it `` should be interpreted as a pause rather than a turnaround for the sagging construction sector.'' `` The prospect of a post-election rise of interest rates presents the risk of a further setback for this credit-sensitive industry,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. `` Housing, which provided most of October's support, is especially vulnerable.'' Housing starts were up by about 7 percent in October, with the value of contracts for one - and multi-family houses rising 4 percent to an annualized $ 120.8 billion, the report said The report said that all regions shared in the improved housing activity but the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, which experienced a 10 percent decline from September's rate of contracting. October contracting for nonresidential buildings fell 8 percent to an annualized $ 75.6 billion, the report said. It said the biggest declines were in office buildings, down 23 percent, and in schools, down 22 percent. For the first 10 months, new construction starts on an unadjusted basis totaled $ 213.4 billion, down 3 percent from the same period in 1987, the report said. The South, with a shortfall of 6 percent, remained the nation's weakest building market in 1988, while the West held even with last year, it said.

<HEAD>Shareholder Windfalls From Megadeals: Where Will All That Money Go?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Billions of dollars in potential shareholder profits from two staggering takeover deals have aroused a debate over how the money will be reinvested, with some strategists saying the outcome could determine the future direction of stocks and the economy. In one of the biggest takeovers ever, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> will buy <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 12.6 billion or $ 106 a share. For owners of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> shares prior to the takeover plan _ first disclosed last month, when the stock traded at about $ 60 _ that represents a profit of more than 76 percent. An even bigger deal looms for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been the target of competing bids valued at between $ 21.3 billion to $ 26.8 billion, or $ 94 a share to $ 118 as share. For holders of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shares, which traded at about $ 56 in mid-October, that means a potential maximum profit of nearly 111 percent. If a significant part of the money from the megadeals is plowed back into the stock market, it would be considered a strong sign of confidence that the country is growing and recession is unlikely for a while. On the other hand, if most of the money goes into interest-bearing accounts or government bonds, it will reinforce fears that stocks will head lower and an economic downturn is n't far off. `` My opinion is the stock market is in a major peak,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLoggia </PERSON>, author of Special Situation Report, a widely followed market newsletter based in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` My advice, to anybody lucky enough to own stock in a takeover target taken out in a peak, is to put it to work in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill,'' <PERSON> LaLoggia </PERSON> said. A few optimists have predicted that because of the sheer volume of this money, some will find its way into the stock market and could serve as the octane to drive up prices, perhaps snapping Wall Street out of its slump. But the prevailing view appears to be that most shareholders _ the majority of them large institutional investors _ likely will park their profits in safe, short-term government <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. The 8.3 percent yield of a three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill represents a better investment than components of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, a widely watched barometer of the general stock market's health, which has risen about 8.7 percent the entire year `` With interest rates moving up, and three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasuries </ORGANIZATION> yielding more than 8 percent, it's hard to justify giving up that safety for the risk of the stock market,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` That suggests to me that whoever owns shares in whatever celebrated buyout is going on, if he listens to most investment advisers, he wo n't put it back into the stock market,'' <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON> said. `` He'll wait for a sunnier day.'' Countering this view is the theory that while demand for stocks continues, the number of stocks is shrinking, partly because of takeovers and mergers such as the <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deals. According to Federal Reserve figures, the amount of available stock has shrunk by about $ 75 billion in each of the past two years. If that's true, some strategists say, simple laws of supply and demand will dictate that stock prices rise, making them more attractive and drawing more investors _ including those who made windfall profits in the two big takeovers. `` I would assume part of that money would be going into the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalasani </PERSON>, a market strategist at the Cleveland-based firm <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think there are other stocks priced similarly to those two companies prior to when the takeovers were announced,'' he said. `` Some of the money would go into these companies, regardless of whether they will be taken over.'' Others say the supply-demand theory is a fiction promoted by the securities industry when it's clear the stock market has hit a cyclical high. `` I regard all the work I've seen that says there's a supply-demand situation to be nonsense,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Cramer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money management firm. `` The main reason is, you can buy all the GE you want, you can buy all the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> you want, and the prices are n't rising,'' he said. `` There are too many stocks that nobody wants and too few that everybody wants.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his final budget, will make one last effort to overhaul the way <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> parcels out money, including recommending a switch from 1-year to 2-year spending plans, administration sources said Tuesday. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president will submit a laundry list of recommended changes in the way the appropriations process works. Many of these proposals are ones that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sought repeatedly during his White House tenure, such as presidential authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will leave office without getting any of his pet reforms adopted, advisers to President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have indicated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will pursue the fight for at least some of the changes. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who will stay on in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, has been particularly supportive of the 2-year budget cycle. `` The planning for the federal government is so hectic that if we can get it on a 2-year basis we would greatly improve the process and I think that many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> feel the same way,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has said. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must review agencies' requests for funds each year and pass a spending plan for the budget year, which begins Oct. 1. The deliberations consume hundreds of hours for lawmakers, who often miss the start of the fiscal year and are forced to pass a stopgap spending measure to keep the government from shutting down. In his State of the Union address last January, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for a switch to a 2-year budget cycle, proposing that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> try the approach on a trial basis covering defense spending for two years. The effort was short-circuited, however, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration were forced to enter budget summit negotiations late last year following the collapse of the stock market. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has encountered stiff opposition in the past to his ideas for budget reform, primarily because many of them involve shifting power from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the president. But some officials suggested that with a new administration and the urgent need to deal with the budget deficit, it was possible that reforming the budget process would gain momentum. Many are looking to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a high-level advisory panel on the deficit, to take the lead in recommending ways to streamline the budget process. Several members of the commission, including former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, have said they believe reforming the process should be a top priority in any deficit-reduction plan. According to sources, these are the proposals the president is expected to make on Jan. 9 when he sends his final budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: _ 2-YEAR BUDGET CYCLE <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said that a 2-year budget would eliminate repetitive annual budget tasks, give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more time for oversight functions and eliminate budgetary gimmicks, such as shifting spending from one year into the next to make the deficit appear smaller. _ LINE ITEM VETO The president has repeatedly sought the same power `` that 43 governors have'' to veto individual items in a spending bill without having to reject the entire bill. The veto could be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses. _ BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT Another <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> perennial, this constitutional amendment would require revenues and spending to be in balance, similar to requirements in effect in many states. Along with this, the president also supports a constitutional amendment to require a greater-than-majority vote whenever <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> raises taxes. _ JOINT RESOLUTION Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes a joint resolution early in the budget process that provides the broad outlines for spending and taxes, but this proposal is not subject to presidential review. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants a change to require the president's signature on the resolution as a way of involving the executive branch in the process. _ PRESIDENTIAL CUTS The president under current law must ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for permission if he decides not to spend money the lawmakers appropriate. The request, known as a `` rescission,'' however, can simply be ignored by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, forcing the president to go ahead and spend the money. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to require <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to go on record with an up-or-down vote each time a president asks for authority not to spend money. _ INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to appropriate money through 13 separate spending bills but occasionally ends up passing a catchall bill with up to two-thirds of the government's spending crammed into one massive document For the first time since 1976, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was able to get all 13 spending bills passed this year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would like stiffer rules to make <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> live up to this requirement.

 The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports should increase slightly to $ 36.5 billion this year but the volume of sales will fall about 8 percent lagely because of last summer's drought, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Export values are predicted to grow by $ 1 billion in fiscal 1989, while volume will drop to 136 million metric tons, down from a six-year high of 147.5 million metric tons in the year ended Sept. 30, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, acting undersecretary of agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> delivered what he described as a `` bright'' agricultural trade forecast at the opening session of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Agricultural Outlook Conference, an annual event in which government analysts outline prospects for the coming year for farmers and agribusiness. `` Export volume is forecast smaller as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world trade shrinks for drought-affected products,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. Overall, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to account for 48 percent of world total grain trade in 1989, down from 50 percent. One of the hardest hit commodities is soybeans, with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world soybean trade forecast to drop to 35 percent in 1989 from 49 percent. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world wheat trade is expected to show a small gain in 1989, the volume of American wheat and flour exports is forecast to fall by about 3 percent while corn exports should grow by 2 percent, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In general, farm prices are rising because of lower global grain stocks, mostly from the drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said world prices for wheat, corn and soybeans should be their highest since 1985. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said a $ 2.6 billion increase in the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and feed exports will offset declines for cotton and oilseeds in 1989. `` For <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture, the challenge in the coming year will be to sustain the momentum in overseas sales which has been regained over the past few years,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` This will require more competitive prices, aggressive market development, persistent trade policy efforts and a market-oriented trade philosophy.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> reported that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers probably will receive less cash income but higher net income next year in the aftermath of the summer drought. Consumers are expected to pay 3 percent to 5 percent more for food in 1989, compared with about a 4 percent increase this year. Smaller crop supplies, firm demand and higher prices are shaping the global agricultural outlook for 1989, according to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>. Expanded output appears likely in the second half of 1989, and he said continued large supplies of animal products probably will dampen livestock price increases. Still, American farmers can expect slightly higher receipts when they market their crops and livestock in 1989, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> said. `` But they will be getting less in direct government payments and their production expenses will rise with expanded acreage and costlier production inputs,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> said. Cash income therefore is likely to decline by about 10 percent from this year's record-tying estimated level of $ 56 billion to $ 58 billion, he said. In contrast, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> said, net farm income is expected to about 20 percent above this year's estimated level of $ 38 billion to $ 40 billion. `` The 1989 outlook favors the food shopper, even though the drought trimmed potential meat output,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> said. He said meat supplies would be the second largest ever, boosted by sizable pork supplies and even greater poultry supplies.

 <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> $ 237 million in the next two weeks and millions more in coming years in return for secrets about the software that runs <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframe computers, arbitrators said Tuesday. The arbitrators' binding order ends a bitter dispute that began in 1982, when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> of copying the complex base-layer software that runs <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s most powerful computers. The arbitrators, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mnookin </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, compensated <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> for the information it must surrender while removing doubt about the legality of compatible software developed by <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>. `` The arbitrators, Solomon-like, solved a dilemma in that both sides get what they want,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geran </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Both companies issued written statements expressing satisfaction with the order but were forbidden by the arbitrators from commenting further. Analysts said the amount of money being paid to the world's largest computer company was less important than the affirmation of its property rights and the limits on information <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> can obtain `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> came out ahead on the arbitration. What <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> gave up was limited, and they got back a nice sum of money,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Soundview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest computer maker, has already paid $ 471 million to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> under a defunct 1983 accord and $ 125 million as partial payment for a paid-up license covering future use of previously released <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> programs, some of which contain <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> programming material In addition to the $ 237 million that remains to be paid on the paid-up license, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> will make annual payments each year through June 25, 1997, for use of new <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> programming material. The arbitrators will decide how big the payments will In 1989, the fee will be between $ 26 million and $ 51 million. By the end of the century, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>'s overall payments to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> could exceed $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose 50 cents a share to $ 119.37 -LCB- Tuesday in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, after rising $ 2.87 -LCB- a share Monday on anticipation of the announcement. The announcement was made after the close of Tuesday's trading of <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> stock in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The companies reached a private settlement in 1983, but the vaguely worded agreement fell apart and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 asked to have the dispute settled by binding arbitration. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gave the case to <PERSON> Mnookin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a retired computer expert from <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The men announced a preliminary agreement in September 1987. In addition to specifying payments, the arbitrators' new order spells out the ground rules under which <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> engineers may examine <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> software in a secure location that will be set up in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> makes computers and base-layer software that are intended to run the same programs as the mainframe computers made by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. However, slight discrepancies in the two companies' base-layer software, known as the operating system, mean that <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>'s computers have not been entirely compatible with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s The arbitrators' order will give <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> enough information so that <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> computers and base software should be able to run all <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframe software without modification. But <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> will still have to do its own programming. `` <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> ca n't just take a reel of tape from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, copy it and send it out to all their customers,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The arbitrators decided <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> deserved the inside information from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> out of fairness to <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> customers and to the company itself, which began copying <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s base software at a time when its legal property status was unclear. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe computers are sold mainly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where some are marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company that is partly owned by <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, also compete in the market for IBM-compatible mainframes. But they do not produce their own base software. Customers of those companies buy their operating system software from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> would continue to do battle before the arbitrators on interpretation of the terms of the order. Protracted battles would hurt <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, which needs to get information as quickly as possible to stay current with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The arbitrators will have jurisdiction over the companies' interactions through Nov. 29, 2002.

 Wall Street broke free of the doldrums Tuesday, rallying on strength in the dollar and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.09 to 2,101.53. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 12-to-7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 938 issues up, 551 down and 478 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 127.42 million shares, up from 123.48 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 155 million shares. Wall Street began the day where it left off on Monday, drifting aimlessly for several hours, but the market picked up steam in the afternoon. Analysts theorized the market's oversold condition made stocks ripe for gains, and improvements in the dollar and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices were reason enough for investors to start buying. `` I think the negatives are all on the table,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everyone who wanted to sell, sold.'' With those negatives _ such as rising interest rates _ discounted by investors, the market had a better tone, <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON> said. Analysts said program buying also added fuel to the rally, but Tuesday's low volume was evidence that traders were still mistrustful. `` No one believes it,'' <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON> said. `` They wo n't believe it until it has muscle.'' Many investors were on the sidelines, waiting for Friday's unemployment figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that might give some clue as to whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will tighten or relax credit <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to raise its discount rate.

 The dollar dropped sharply and then recovered most of its ground Tuesday in a confused session dominated by speculation about the direction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. The dollar declined after the government reported an upward revision in the third-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent. Some traders said the dollar fell because the market had been anticipating growth of closer to 3 percent during the July-September period. Others said the growth was healthy and did not account entirely for the dollar's drop. The dollar's rise, which picked up momentum in the early afternoon in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, appeared to be unrelated to any economic news, traders said. Some big banks may have bid the dollar up in an effort to put a squeeze on `` shorts'' _ that is, traders who had borrowed dollars in hopes that the currency would decline and they would be able to make a profit by paying back the lenders with cheaper dollars, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It caught a lot of people by surprise,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, senior corporate foreign-exchange dealer for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders were looking ahead to Friday's report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment in November, which could give a hint about the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s future monetary policy. Traders have chosen to focus in recent weeks on the outlook for interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Tighter monetary policy would push up short-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, making dollar-denominated securities more attractive to investors.

<HEAD>Coniston Extends $29-a-Share Offer to All of TW Service Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investor group pursuing <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its tender offer for some of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' shares attracted about twice as many shares as sought and that it was extending its $ 29-a-share offer to all of the food services company's stock. The group, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, said its amended offer of $ 1.14 billion in cash for the 81 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> that it does not already own would expire at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 13. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> also said it had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to require the TW Services board to redeem or invalidate the poison-pill rights that would otherwise make its bid for control of the company prohibitively expensive. In response, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said its board would consider <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s amended offer `` in due course. Its chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salizzoni </PERSON>, said the substantial number of shares tendered was `` irrelevant'' because the partial tender was `` designed from the outset to stampede shareholders into tendering their stock in hopes of forcing the company into another transaction.'' He said the amended <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> offer for all <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> stock `` remains highly conditional.'' `` Given that it is conditioned, among other things, on <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> entering into a satisfactory merger agreement, it remains merely an invitation to enter merger negotiations,'' he said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based investment firm that already owns about 9.3 million of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' 48.6 million shares, launched a tender offer for 15.75 million of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> shares in late October. The combination of those shares with what <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> already owned would give it about 51 percent of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said that when its partial tender offer expired at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, nearly 30.2 million shares had been tendered which would have given <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> nearly 82 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding shares Under its two-step plan, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said it would then acquire the remaining shares in a merger for $ 29 a share in cash. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said the two-step plan was devised to get around the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> anti-takeover law that restricts uninvited bidders from building a stake in a company based in that state. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal, said he expects the only obstacle that would prevent <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> from buying tendered stock after its offer expires next month would be the poison pill. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> has said that if it acquires <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, it plans to sell the company's health services operations, which include 27 skilled nursing facilities and two retirement living centers. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' other operations include 1,200 <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s restaurants, 400 <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION>'s fast-food restaurants and <ORGANIZATION> Canteen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a food services company.

<HEAD>Sugar Rallies On Supply Fears, Technical Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices surged Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> despite a lack of fresh news, a sign of the market's increasing concern about the possibility of a supply shortage, analysts said On other markets, grains and soybeans finished mostly higher; energy futures were mixed; precious metals were lower; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Sugar for delivery in March settled .33 cent higher at 11.30 cents a pound, the contract's highest close since Aug. 8, which also was the last day March sugar closed above 11 cents. During Tuesday's session, the March contract traded as high as 11.33 cents a pound, challenging the previous day's intra-day peak of 11.34 cents, a four-month high. Since falling below 9 cents a pound in late September, sugar futures have risen fairly steadily on indications that world sugar production in the current crop year may fall short of consumption, reducing already-low inventories to critical levels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> all are rumored to be looking for more sugar in the September-through-August crop year, yet <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> reportedly has asked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to accept deferred delivery of scheduled shipments, analysts said. Last week, the West German statistics firm F.O. Licht reduced its estimate of this year's European sugar-beet crop by 750,000 metric tons, increasing fears of a production defict instead of the surplus that had been expected only a few months ago. `` There have been concerns that if there is a sudden increase in demand from the physical market, the sugar might not be available. Now that there's the possibility of a production deficit, those concerns are being felt even more strongly,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, a sugar market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said technical signals _ the chart patterns on which many speculators base their trading decisions _ were extremely bullish. Wheat, corn and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a late flurry of buying by traders who had sold contracts earlier in the session. Analysts attributed the closing rally almost entirely to `` short-covering,'' a form of profit-taking that amounts to selling high, then buying low instead of buying low, then selling high. Oat futures plunged for the second straight day in a continuing reaction to abundant supplies of feed-quality oats, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Homan </PERSON>, an independent trader. <PERSON> Homan </PERSON> also said the oat market was shrinking away from the inflated prices caused by drought-related panic buying during the summer. Wheat settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher with December at $ 4.23 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.56 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 9 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.95 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 4 \ cents higher with January at $ 7.53 -RCB- a bushel Energy futures settled mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the markets began consolidating the sharp gains of recent sessions. After the close of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> released figures showing a 2.7 million-barrel drawdown in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude-oil stocks and a 2.5-million-barrel decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline stocks last week. Stocks of petroleum distillates increased by 1.76 million barrels, according to the API. Crude futures were expected to open higher Wednesday in reaction to the report. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 11 cents lower to 15 cents higher with January at $ 14.92 a barrel; heating oil was .86 cent lower to .80 cent higher with December at 47.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .01 cent lower to .70 cent higher with December at 46.87 cents a gallon. Intra-day weakness in crude prices, coupled with the weakness of the dollar pressured precious-metals futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled 50 cents to $ 1.40 lower with December at $ 421.90 a troy ounce; silver was 8.5 cents to 9 cents lower with December at $ 6.03 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .10 cent to .47 cent lower with December at 73.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .25 cent higher with January at 82.70 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower to .45 cent higher with December at 39.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .13 cent lower with February at 43.05 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled 2.20 points higher at 271.15. The contract is worth $ 500 a point.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and two employees were indicted Tuesday on federal charges of hiding $ 10 million worth of savings in a contract to make a battlefield computer system. GE, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, said the indictment was `` unfair'' and `` sensationalized,'' adding that the company intends to fight the charges. GE also said an internal investigation showed pricing discrepancies totaling $ 3.69 million, which the company already has refunded. GE faces a maximum penalty of $ 71.871 million plus restitution, the government said. `` We look forward to the opportunity to have a jury judge the merits of the case,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, first assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The defense case was not the first involving GE. In 1985, the company pleaded guilty to unrelated contract-fraud charges. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said no decisions have been made as yet on suspension or debarment of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to bid on defense contracts. `` The allegations will now have to be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The 321-count indictment charges that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, through its wholly-owned subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, negotiated subcontracting costs less than anticipated and hid the lower prices from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. GE was awarded a $ 250 million contract in June 1983 to make the `` decentralized automated service support system'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The company and the two employees lied to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about the prices the company was paying for parts and raw materials and double-billed for some materials, according to the indictment. The government also charges <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, formerly the subcontracts manager for <LOCATION> MATSCO </LOCATION>, with trying to cover up the scheme by altering dates of purchase orders and withholding information from government auditors. The other employee, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, 51, of King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, formerly the materials manager for MATSCO, was also charged with lying to a federal auditor. In its statement, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> denied any criminal wrongdoing and said the employees maintained their innocence. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> referred reporters to the company attorneys. `` The simple fact is that the case against <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> revolves around a negotiaion in the spring of 1983 in which the two employees at <ORGANIZATION> MASCO </ORGANIZATION> allegedly failed to notify the Army that they had succeeded in negotiating lower subcontract prices with several vendors than had originally been projected,'' <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said in a written statement. `` Any legitimate governmental interest could be served by an appropriate civil resolution of this matter,'' <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said. GE is charged with five counts of mail fraud and 312 counts of presenting false claims to the government. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> was charged with racketeering, five counts of mail fraud and two counts of making false statements and concealing material facts from a federal agency. <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> was charged with one count of racketeering, five counts of mail fraud, one count of obstructing agency proceedings and one count of making false statements and concealing material facts from a federal agency. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> have since been transferred to other parts of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, the government said. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> did $ 5.8 billion worth of business with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the government said. If convicted, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> faces a maximum of 55 years in jail, $ 1.276 million in fines and forfeiture of salary bonuses and company stock derived from the racketeering. <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> faces the same penalties plus $ 5,000 more in fines if convicted. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbist </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said he did not know the amount of bonuses the men received. GE pleaded guilty in May 1985 to contract-fraud charges, paying a $ 1.04 million fine and rembursing the government $ 800,000. The company was indicted in March 1985 for forging employee time cards and manipulating costs to recover losses on the Minuteman missles.

 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken to make further disclosures before it may buy stock of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> under its $ 290 million hostile buyout offer. Separately, Church's board of directors met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and authorized management to explore alternatives to Popeyes' $ 8 a share tender offer, including a possible transaction with a third party. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, Texas-based Church's, the nation's second-biggest fried chicken chain, rejected Popeyes' offer as inadequate on Oct. 25, and again on Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction barring Popeyes from buying <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s stock until 10 business days after it makes certain disclosures regarding its alleged use of non-public corporate information. Church's has contended that its former chief financial officer, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON>, took confidential inside corporate information with him when he was hired by New Orleans-based Popeyes, the nation's No. 3 chicken chain. Church's also contened Popeyes financial adviser, <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perrella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, relied on that information in formulating the takeover bid. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> ordered Popeyes: to reveal the information on which its buyout offer was made and to stop using, at least for now, any confidential Church's information it might have. The judge also ordered Popeyes to disclose the amount of money the company had spent to buy and maintain an offshore racing boat, corporate jet, helicopter, yacht, bus and luxury car used by its chairman, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order forbidding Popeyes from pursuing the buyout until similar disclosures were made. A Church's spokesman said the company would appeal the judge's refusal to grant a permanent injunction against the takeover and a preliminary injunction on the antitrust claims <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, Popeyes' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> lawyer, said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> would have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on the claim that Popeyes' offer was based on insider information. Regarding the corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other conveyances, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said: `` All those expenses have been treated as legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by Mr. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and been reviewed very carefully.''
