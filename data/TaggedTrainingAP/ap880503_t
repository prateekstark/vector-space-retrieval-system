<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to write mankind out of their hymns in favor of people and include portrayals of God as a feminine figure, but the denomination did n't tamper with psalms The nation's second-largest Protestant body overwhelmingly adopted a new hymnal that generally shifts to inclusive language for humans, such as using `` All'' for `` men'' and `` people'' for `` mankind.'' But members decided to retain masculine pronouns for God in the book's psalms, denying the request of several delegates to use gender-neutral nouns such as `` God's'' rather than `` His.'' Delegates of the 9.6 million-member denomination _ whose founder, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>, exhorted followers to `` Sing lustily and with full courage'' _ approved the new hymnal by 893 to 69. `` An exciting and historical moment,'' proclaimed the Rev. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevins </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, after applause quieted in the <ORGANIZATION> Cervantes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, packed with about 3,000 visitors and observers. It was the eighth day of the church's 11-day quadrennial governing conference. Delegates also approved a major, revamped summary of doctrine, reflecting a conservative shift in church attitudes. It gives Scripture a firmer primacy and eliminates an explicit acceptance of `` pluralism'' in concepts, a key shift away from a recognition of divergent theologies, including some embraced by feminists and leftist liberation movements. But the new hymnbook, replacing the old edition of 1966, provided the zestful note of the day, with several interludes of rousing song from the book and deliberations about it. The hefty, 960-page volume combines ritual, psalms and 625 songs, compared with 552 in the old book. The hymnal has 330 songs new to Methodists, including gospel songs, spirituals, ethnic hymns and new compositions. Some hymns such as `` Faith of Our Fathers'' and `` Dear Lord and Father of <LOCATION> Mankind </LOCATION>'' were not changed at all because they are imprinted deeply in people's memories. But the most popular Easter hymn, `` Christ the Lord is Risen Today,'' was given a revised first verse changing `` sons of men and angels say'' to `` earth and heaven in chorus say.'' The book also includes `` Good Christian Friends Rejoice'' instead of the old `` Good Christian Men Rejoice,'' and substitutes `` God of the Ages'' for `` God of Our Fathers.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, editor of the new hymnbook, said the revision offered a chance to `` address God in alternative terms,'' other than masculine, but `` we backed off because of controversy.'' As a result, he said, only three hymns offer feminine images of God. Several others were rejected. Those three include `` Wonder of Wonders'' and `` How Can We Name a Love,'' by British poet <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>, which portay God both as mother and father. The third song, `` The Care the Eagle Gives Her Young,'' compares God to a mother eagle. The hymnal also retains many popular mainstays, including many of <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>'s. At one point in the book's genesis, a massive reaction by members overturned a committee decision to delete `` Onward Christian Soldiers'' and `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' because of their militaristic metaphors. It also keeps familiar revival hymns, such as `` In the Garden'' and `` Jesus Calls Us,'' often frowned on by musicologists. Tuesday's only substantial debate concerned the use of masculine pronouns for God in the book's psalms. They had been substituted with gender-neutral nouns initially, but a legislative committee recommended that masculine pronouns be restored, and the conference agreed despite the opposition of some delegates. Bishop <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Job </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, who chaired the 25-member committee that worked four years in compiling the volume, said the `` voice of the whole church'' was involved in the process. Job told a news conference the new book `` will serve to draw this denomination toward its center, toward Christ. It also will serve to open us to people and cultures to which we have n't been sensitive.''

 Banks will reopen for nearly normal operations next Monday after being closed for two months because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis, the president of the Bankers' Association announced. Earlier Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said it will not mediate the crisis until the civilian government that does Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s bidding has `` a change of attitude.'' <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president, said in a television interview Tuesday that to avoid a run on the banks, the amount of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted. `` We are trying to reactivate the economy of the country,'' <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON> said. `` We will take care of the public in all banking activities'' within the restrictions set by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> late in March, he said. Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25 percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day the government ordered banks closed. It sets a maximum of $ 10,000, with the rest frozen for 90 days. Withdrawals of up to $ 50 may be made from savings accounts one month after banks reopen. Payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash availability in each bank. The commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks. On April 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. Because of limits on withdrawals, however, about 75 percent of the checks deposited bounced, analysts and business people said. A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed, including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans; transferring funds within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and making foreign exchange transfers. But business people said the operations were largely on paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity and credit. The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here, most of them foreign. Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67 banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international banking business. Others also closed their doors because of the impact of the crisis. Some closed as early as late February, after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> following the president's attempt tried to fire the military strongman. The political instability, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and the lack of banking facilities brought <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy to a near-standstill. The <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had urged the banks to reopen with some restrictions intended to `` maintain the cash position of the banks and protect depositors.'' The church agreed at the end of March to mediate talks between the government and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents. It suspended the effort a week later. In a statement issued Tuesday, the church accused the government and official news media of `` personal and institutional attacks'' on it and Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. `` Since the attacks have proliferated in government news media, we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church,'' it said. Monsignor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, signed the statement. The bishops had offered to seek an `` honorable way out for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as commander of the Defense Forces.'' The opposition demands <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave as a condition for further talks, but the government said it would not accept conditions for negotiating. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is considering stepping down on Aug. 12, which <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fifth anniversary as defense chief <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under federal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, which he denies. In its attempt to remove him, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration imposed sanctions that include blocking Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and prohibiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The church has held the government responsible for the crisis, but also blamed the `` economic domination of foreign powers and.. the corruption in the public and private sectors.'' Leaders of the opposition said Tuesday they had held their first meeting aimed at establishing common objectives. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said the objectives include `` democratization of the country and the search for a solution to the economic and political crisis.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s chief executive.

<HEAD>States Denied Chance To Tax Income From Federal Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Less than two weeks after creating a potential new source of federal tax money, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is denying a similar opportunity for state treasuries. The justices on Monday refused to let states tax pension fund income from investments in federal government securities. On April 20, the court had ruled that the federal government may tax the interest earned on state and municipal bonds. Although congressional leaders say there is no plan to impose such taxes, the court's ruling last month cleared away a constitutional hurdle in the event <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> some day changes federal tax law. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, writing for the court on April 20, said giving the federal government power to tax state and municipal bonds does not suggest that states should have reciprocal power. `` States can never tax the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> directly,'' he said. `` The federal tax immunity has always been greater than the states' immunity. That opinion was reinforced indirectly Monday as the court rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials seeking to tax income from such federal obligations as treasury bills and short-term borrowing. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials said they should be allowed to tax the income after it is distributed to retirees. The <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last December upheld a ruling by a state judge who said the pension fund money is tax-exempt. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ruled that interest on federal obligations is immune from state taxation even when the income is passed on by a pension fund to a retired investor. `` In practical operation, the tax in question was in fact a state tax on interest derived from federal obligations,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. The fact that pension money was passed on to someone other than the fund itself does not eliminate the exemption enjoyed by investments in federal securities, he said. The judge rejected arguments by state officials that interest on a government security is exempt `` only in the hands of the original recipient unless there is a specific federal statute to pass through the tax-exempt character of such income.'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> ruled in favor of <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, who when he retired in 1981 received a lump-sum distribution of $ 141,000 from a savings plan in which he had invested. The money included $ 35,000 in interest on federal securities. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials said Keys owed an additional tax of $ 1,246 on the income from the government obligations. The court rulings in Keys' favor meant he received a tax refund of $ 203 plus interest. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> officials said a lot more was at stake. They said the state court rulings could force them to examine the source of payments from pension and mutual funds, corporate dividends and even bank deposit interest and then eliminate from the state's tax base any income traced to investments in federal obligations.

<BYLINE>WASHINGTON WIRE: Could Missouri Bullfrogs Eat Britain?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It happened in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and the plot reminded the congressman from Missouri of the title of an imaginary horror film _ `` The Bullfrogs That Ate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' According to Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., British gardeners who raise goldfish in ornamental pools were looking for a way to scare off marauding cats that scooped the goldfish out of the pools and had them for lunch The solution: A British pet store imported <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> tadpoles which are said to grow into foot-long <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bullfrogs, large enough to give a British cat the fight of his or her life. But, said <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>, alarmed environmentalists saw in all of this an unintended consequence. `` Ecologists protested that the carnivorous amphibians would eat native frogs and newts and wreck the area's ecological balance,'' he said. So the pet store recalled 400 <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bullfrogs as a threat to the native-born inhabitants of British gardens, <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON> said and added this: `` After hearing this, I hopped over to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to deliver this sad news to my colleagues. `` Lest the tiny creatures of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> croak, it is far better that our <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bullfrogs be recalled. Sounds like a horror film _ `` The Bullfrogs That Ate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.' `` And so my colleagues I stand before you warts and all. `` As a responsible Missourian, I believe that although we should not leap to conclusions, we must ensure our frogs do not cause any undue harm in the land of <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` So we welcome our British brethren to send back both our tadpoles and foot-long bullfrogs back home. `` Imagine _ a foot-long frog! `` Who would believe it? `` It's no wonder they call <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> the ` Show Me State.'''

 Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week to receive <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tributes on the 20th anniversary of the launching of her campaign to beautify the capital and the nation's highways. The celebration took place at a season appropriate to the occasion. The flowers of spring _ most of them planted as a result of her labors _ were bursting like an explosion in a paint factory. But the occasion, perhaps inevitably, also brought forth memories of President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s legendary style and towering ego. Some went to the point of how <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> coped with it all. Rep. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who said he had been proud to call himself `` <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s congressman,'' told the House of the time Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had prepared dinner for guests at the <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> ranch only to find her husband was driving some of the guests around the ranch `` to show them the deer and the antelope and where the buffalo do not roam.'' Three times, he said, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> radioed the car using the Secret Service code names for the presidential couple. `` Volcano, this is Volunteer,'' she said. `` When can we serve dinner?'' `` Finally, <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> said, `` after hours of waiting, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s voice came over the radio _ ` Volcano, this is Volunteer Our guests and I are sitting down at the table. Goodbye.' `` Whereupon, without a word, the president wheeled his car around and returned to the ranch house so quickly he not only got there in time for dinner, he got there in time to say the blessing.'' Another Texan remembered a hunt at the <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> ranch for which <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had made some unusual preparations. He had hired an artist to record the results. After it was over the artist produced five identical paintings showing <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the foreground bringing down a bird. When <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> saw the results, this Texan said, he sent it back for retouching. The new version showed the president bringing down two birds, not just one. Another tale teller told of a Johnson friend using his car phone to call <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> who was riding in his car. `` The purpose was to show he had his own car phone and he started bragging about it to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> produced an immediate display of one-upmanship. `` <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, ` Let me put you on hold for a moment, someone's calling on my other line.'

 A Soviet scientist says that despite the delay in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space exploration caused by the Challenger disaster, his country is not ahead in space. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeev </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that the Soviets have taken advantage of the two years that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not been able to launch satellites easily, but he said both countries could learn from the other. `` We never have had the illusion that we were ahead,'' said <PERSON> Galeev </PERSON> at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Temporarily, you've lost launch capability, but if you take into account the satellites waiting to be launched, the understanding is that you'll easily catch up,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not had regular space launches since Challenger exploded and killed its seven crewmembers on Jan. 28, 1986. Since then, the space shuttle fleet, which was the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> launch system, has been grounded. Flights are scheduled to resume in August. `` We took advantage of this delay,'' said <PERSON> Galeev </PERSON>. `` We are still leading in a few fields.'' He noted, however, that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has to launch more satellites because its equipment is not as durable as American models. `` We launch a lot of satellites but their lifetime is shorter,'' he said. `` That means we do n't get as much data.'' A Soviet astronomer, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunyaev </PERSON>, also a co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said scientists everywhere keenly felt the Challenger accident. `` Challenger was a tragedy for astronomers,'' he said, `` because the space telescope is still on the ground.'' <PERSON> Sunyaev </PERSON> said astronomers are anxious for the American-made telescope to be placed into orbit and to start bringing back new visions of the universe. The telescope is to be the most powerful astronomy instrument ever placed into space. In answer to a question, <PERSON> Sunyaev </PERSON> admitted that some of the scientific information gathered by the Soviet space program has been used for military purposes. But he said this can be said of many things learned by scientists. `` Even some of the work of <PERSON> Issac </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> has been used for military purposes,'' he said. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> formulated basic principles of gravity and motion. <PERSON> Galeev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sunyaev </PERSON> answered questions at a news conference that marked the end of a week of meetings with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> colleagues who are members of the U.S.-Soviet joint working groups on astronomy and astrophysics. Representatives of the two spacefaring nations met to work out ways to exchange data from their space science programs. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the working groups arrived at an agreement, but the plan will have to be approved by leaders of the two governments before it is released publicly.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> congressman waging an on-again, off-again campaign for president, is hoping to pick up a few delegates today in his home state but admits his chances of winning even his own congressional district are slim. <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, a Democrat from suburban <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> who also is seeking his third term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, announced last summer that he would run for president to attract attention to the problems of his congressional district, which has been hard hit by the decline of the steel industry. <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> said he would run a national campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, but it never materialized. He blamed a lack of money. `` If I had the same amount of money these other candidates had in the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and could have come on TV the past two weeks, there would have been a fight,'' he said. <PERSON> Leesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> secretary of state's office said <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> met the qualifications to get onto the ballot in 12 of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s 21 congressional districts. A former sheriff, <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> is best known for successfully defending himself against charges that he accepted $ 163,000 from mobsters in 1980. But he had little name recognition outside his own district. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Binning </PERSON>, chairman of the political science department at <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy was actually given some credence early on because so many of the Democratic candidates were not well known nationally. But ultimately, <PERSON> Binning </PERSON> said, `` I think <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> would have to win a major statewide office in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in order to be considered a viable candidate for president.'' A survey conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> suggested residents of his district favor <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> as a congressman, but not as a presidential candidate. The poll, commissioned by The <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vindicator </ORGANIZATION>, indicated 38 percent of the 697 people surveyed favor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic front-runner, with <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> supported by 14 percent and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backed by 11 percent. Nearly a quarter of the participants were undecided. However, more than 70 percent of the same respondents supported <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>'s bid to a third term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The poll was conducted between April 11 and April 20 and had a margin of error of 5-6 percentage points.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is the apparent target of anonymous graffiti artists who have left inscriptions such as `` sleazy'' and `` resign'' on the walls of the main <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> building. The graffiti began appearing at about the time two top aides to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> resigned March 29 due to concern about problems associated with the criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The word `` sleazy'' last week was scrawled in black, 4-inch-high letters on a second-floor staircase in the middle of the building. The stairwell is far from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s fifth-floor office but is heavily traveled. Employees first noticed the graffiti there Friday, said a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity. The basement and first-floor levels of the staircase are heavily traveled because they lead to the cafeteria. In another instance, the word `` resign'' was scribbled on a wall near <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s office but it was cleaned off quickly, said department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Such graffiti started appearing around the same time that Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> submitted their protest resignations March 29, the course said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> quit out of concern that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure as attorney general was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operation, morale and public image, sources said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Monday for a meeting of police executives. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> last May 11 launched an investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities including his involvement with the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. The probe also has examined his holdings of regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone stock and his wife's $ 40,000-a-year job. The money for <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job comes from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> family whose real estate company leases office space to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Ozone Violations Up, Monoxide Violations Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More areas violated federal clean air standards last year for ozone, a principal part of smog, while fewer violated the carbon monoxide standard, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today. Sixty-eight urban and rural areas failed to meet the limit for ozone, up from 62 last year. Fifty-nine urban areas failed to meet the carbon monoxide standard, down from 65 last year. There is substantial overlap between the two lists, and all the nation's 24 largest metropolitan areas are on one or both. The largest urban area not on either list is <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We had a hot, dry summer in the East, which tends to push up ozone levels,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. `` It was much like the summer of 1983, except confined to the East.'' The decline in carbon monoxide was expected as more and more cars made before 1981 are junked. Cars made before then had to meet less stringent standards for exhaust pollution. In addition, the same weather that elevates ozone tends to depress carbon monoxide, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> noted. The carbon monoxide list is based on data for two years. Looking only at 1987 readings, 37 cities would have failed to comply, while 50 would have flunked in 1986. Motor vehicle exhaust is the primary source of carbon monoxide, which can interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. In most areas, motor vehicles also are the major source of a key raw material for making smog, unburned gasoline from both exhaust pipes and natural evaporation from the fuel system. Those gasoline vapors react in sunlight with oxides of nitrogen, also present in exhausts as well as in power plant emissions, to produce ozone. The brighter and sunnier the day, the more ozone that is produced. Ozone is the part of smog that interferes with breathing and makes the chest feel tight. Winds can blow the raw materials for ozone away from the source, but they may still react in sunlight, which accounts for violations in several rural counties in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says. The chemicals that made their ozone were emitted in the <LOCATION> Boston-Washington </LOCATION> corridor. Because weather has such an influence on ozone, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> judges compliance in three-year blocks. This year's compliance is based on ozone readings for 1985-1987. But weather can still push areas into and out of compliance. For example, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, are listed as violators this year, but were not last year. All four were on the 1986 list using 1983-1985 data. The relevant ozone readings for those four cities for 1985-1987 are similar to those for 1983-1985, possibly because the summers of 1983 and 1987 were similar, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is far and away the national leader in ozone pollution, with an average of 143.5 days out of compliance per year over the three-year period. Elsewhere, only <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> showed 10 or more estimated days per year in which the ozone standard would be exceeded. On last year's list, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, much of urban <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> showed such days. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s lists were produced three months early this year to help <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decide what to do about areas that fail to meet the standards. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has prohibited <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from taking any action against non-complying areas until Aug. 31 while it debates the issue. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had planned penalties for some areas for failure to comply with planning requirements. The turnover of the motor vehicle fleet will eventually bring all but a handful of areas into compliance with the carbon monoxide standard, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said agency analysts now estimate that just four to six cities would not comply eventually. For ozone, however, 25 or more cities will not comply without more stringent control measures, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says.

 Ancient custom permits one woman in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to take another as a `` wife,'' but a divorce case involving two such women has thrown up a challenge to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s Western-style legal system. The case involves <PERSON> Wanjiru </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>, a barren widow, who 10 years ago took <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Njeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> as a `` wife'' to bear her the children she desperately wanted. The relationship went sour and the women have asked a Western-style divorce court to sort out their broken marriage, including the question of alimony, child support and property settlement. `` We do n't have a precedent for this case,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mberi </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` The problem we have is that our legal system as practiced in the courts is changing to the Western legal system. But at the same time, in the village we are living with people whose arrangements are based on customary law concepts.'' Marriage between women is not uncommon in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and neither is divorce. But this case is unique because the couple has turned to Western laws, instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal elders decide the issue. Barren women, such as Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>, often take one or more fertile women as `` wives'' to bear children, which the female `` husband'' then claims as her own. Even married women make such arrangements, with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by his spouse's wife. Barren women often are ostracized in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where wealth and prestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has. Since both Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> were single, Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> was entitled to choose the man to father the children. For the surrogate mother, such an arrangement offers the security of a home and income. Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON>, in her late 20s, was a single mother of two children, aged 12 and 10, when she married Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> and took her surname. She brought them to Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s home and had two more children, now 7 and 5. After a fierce quarrel in January 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> chased her `` wife'' from their matrimonial home in the western Kenyan town of <LOCATION> Nakuru </LOCATION>, according to court records. Before turning to the Western-style courts, Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> twice went to a court of tribal elders, asking for alimony and child support or a share of Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s property, including a small grocery store. Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>, about 60, complained that Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> beat her, threatened her life and stole from the business. Both times the elders ruled that Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> could keep the children but should receive nothing else. `` This was not a hardship in the past, as the woman would go back to her father and his community, which jointly owned and shared land and resources,'' explained <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamau </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuria </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> lawyer who specializes in family law. Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> did return to her father, a peasant farmer near <LOCATION> Nakuru </LOCATION>. But when she felt that she and the children were a burden, she sued her former `` husband'' for divorce in the district magistrate's court, again demanding alimony and child support or a share of Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s property. She filed suit in August 1986, but the case has been delayed by a backlog and is expected to be heard soon. Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> had told the tribal courts Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> had no money or property when they married, and that the relationsip gave her status and a comfortable lifestyle. <PERSON> Odhiambo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochieng </PERSON>', Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s lawyer, argues in an affidavit that because the marriage is recognized only by customary law, only a traditional solution is possible: for Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> to return to her father's family with nothing. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s very diversity is at the root of the now-budding legal problems. The East African nation's 22 million people are divided among dozens of ethnic groups who abide by Islamic, <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> and various tribal customary laws in addition to the statutory Western laws inherited from British colonizers at independence 25 years ago. A case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer, S.M. <PERSON> Otieno </PERSON>, against his <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> clansmen in a tussle over whether the widow or the tribe should bury him. The High Court ruled that in the absence of written law, customary law prevails. <PERSON> Otieno </PERSON>'s widow lost. `` These problems are going to have to be tackled and will not go away until <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> is lived in by an overall younger and more modern generation,'' <PERSON> Ochieng </PERSON>' said.

<HEAD>Bush Backers May Make Dukakis' Budget-Balancing Struggle A
Campaign Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has made his efficiency as a manager one of the key selling points in his presidential campaign, is struggling to balance his state budgets for this year and next year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' budget-balancing efforts are turning into something of a balancing act, because his status as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner puts him under intense scrutiny. Supporters of Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are hoping the situation will provide them with ammunition they can use against the governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> boasts that he has given <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> nine balanced budgets as governor, including the current one for fiscal 1988, and that he will do the same for the coming fiscal year. But he'll have to find some way to make up a $ 77 million revenue shortfall this year, and already has proposed $ 233 million in additional cuts to offset supplementary spending. `` We will make the necessary adjustments which will make it possible for us to live within our income,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said last week. He said there are `` a number of ways to do that,'' but has n't said exactly which way he favors <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers were rubbing their hands in anticipation. `` I think it raises a credibility issue for the governor,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state campaign chairman. `` He has talked about balancing a federal budget, yet it appears he is going to have difficulty with a fiscal 1989 state budget.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he will work matters out with the legislature. But some lawmakers are grumbling that that has n't happened yet. `` You are telling us you are going to work with us, and you have n't worked with us,'' Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgkins </PERSON>, a Democrat on the budget-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' budget chief, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, during an appearance before the committee last week No one doubts that the budgets ultimately will be balanced, because they must be under the state constitution. But how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does it could become a campaign issue. `` He is either going to have to raise taxes or cut human services spending, neither of which he wants to do. So it's something we -LRB- Republicans -RRB- are obviously going to watch very carefully,'' said <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> Advocacy groups fighting to keep funding for their programs are mindful of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' status as a presidential candidate. `` I think the governor running for president has created a situation where the advocates feel that they can leverage his cooperation more _ that they can make him look bad if they do n't get what they want,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, the state budget director <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides have consistently said he will not cut existing services to balance this year's budget, but will instead clamp down on program expansions, primarily in human services. But even that tactic is bringing complaints. `` People were promised ... they were going to get this service and they still have n't gotten it yet,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is suffering and you ca n't take that away.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration had projected 6.6 percent revenue growth, but this week reduced its estimate to 5.7 percent. Even so, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Voke </PERSON> says the administration's revenue estimates are too optimistic. A large part of the shortfall is blamed on smaller-than-expected corporate tax collections due to a state law allowing state companies to use losses on out-of-state subsidiaries to reduce their <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> tax bill. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed changing this measure. Meanwhile, the state has an appeal pending with the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The governor has proposed a $ 700 million package of savings and revenue increases to balance his fiscal 1989 budget. Some of the controversial features include: _ Recouping $ 70 million in unclaimed bottle deposits from beverage wholesalers That issue is also before the courts. _ Spending $ 22 million for more tax collectors _ some of the nearly 1,600 new jobs contained in the budget _ to raise $ 190 million in new revenue _ Raising $ 55 million by requiring applicants for Medicaid nursing home coverage to agree to a state lien on their homes for reimbursement after they die The administration has modified the proposal to say Medicaid eligibility will be delayed after applicants transfer assets to others, depending on the size of the transfers.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is displaying his lack of experience on foreign affairs with `` macho'' talk about how to oust <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dictator. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was headed to <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, today to visit research facilities at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before returning home for a belated victory party this evening to celebrate his clinching the number of delegates needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s primary is a week from today. On a primary-eve campaign swing to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ridiculed both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for what the vice president said was naivete about how <PERSON> Panaman </PERSON>'s strongman, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, should be dealt with. `` You'd think it's a cinch listening to these guys: ` Throw out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>! Do this! Do that!''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug indictment. In pressuring him to step down, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must avoid moves that hurt the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people or seem like some `` great bullying, gringos-of-the-North kind of overstatement of power.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told high school students in <LOCATION> Vandalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that `` we're still living down'' past military intervention in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` Ninety percent are now living under democracy in this hemisphere. We do n't want to set that back by some kind of macho statement out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. Even with the nomination all but in hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was continuing to campaign in primary states. On Wednesday, he heads to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which votes June 7. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s celebration tonight comes a week after he actually obtained his mathematical lock on the nomination. He secured the last few delegates he needed in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary on April 26. Aides had thought it would take today's round of contests _ in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> _ to put him over the top. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told 1,200 supporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Canton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> Monday evening, `` They say, ` What in God's name are you doing in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, when you got this Republican nomination wrapped up?' I will not project in overconfidence. I will not project in arrogance.'' `` I will work right down to the Republican convention and, with your help, in the fall will be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. He predicted `` a classical confrontation'' in the general election with a liberal Democrat nominee. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman, said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not expected at tonight's `` Over The Top'' celebration at a posh <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel. There had been speculation that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has stayed neutral during the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries, would use the occasion to formally endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, on Monday, `` I had the feeling the president did endorse me at lunch the other day.'' That was a reference to a private <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting with the president, at which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> congratulated him for his <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> win and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> indicated a formal endorsement would come soon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed exasperated when the question was raised again by local reporters in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. `` Do you think there's any doubt in any credible person's mind about who he's for? So what's the big deal?'' he said. `` You'll see an endorsement soon, so stay tuned.''

 The political joustings, coded language and sophistictated election arguments of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> fade long before they reach this French provincial capital. To the residents of <LOCATION> Foix </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and challenger <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> are just about the same. `` Do you know what ` bof' means?'' asks 80-year-old <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, a retired draftsman, as he sipped his morning coffee on the main square of this lovely town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees. <PERSON> Bof </PERSON> is a French expression that amounts to a verbal shrug. And that's exactly how Boy and many other inhabitants of <LOCATION> Foix </LOCATION> view Sunday's election runoff between the Socialist president and the conservative premier. `` Whether its one or the other, things will continue just the same,'' said Boy. `` It's ` le bof' in general. <LOCATION> Foix </LOCATION>, a town of about 10,000 residents 500 miles from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, is the capital of the <ORGANIZATION> Ariege </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, one of the least populated districts of the country. It is dominated by the 11th century chateau of the Counts of <LOCATION> Foix </LOCATION> perched on a massive rock overlooking the town. The area has a long Socialist tradition, and because of this <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is favored, but with more resignation than enthusiasm. On April 24, in the first round of voting, the Ariege gave <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> 41 percent of its vote, seven points above the president's national score, and 18 percent to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, two points under his overall showing. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> no doubt will win again here Sunday, but it will be a gut vote more than a carefully reasoned choice. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumenc </PERSON>, who for the past 25 years has been the local correspondent for the <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION> newspaper 50 miles away, put it best when he said the things people here really care about are television reception and a proposed tunnel to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` Mitterrand does n't have a program for after May 8,'' said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Firon </PERSON>, a local homebuilder. `` Really, there is no fundamental difference between the two. And they both need the <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> vote.'' <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, leader of the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, won 14.4 percent in the first round, stunning many political observers. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> campaigned hard on a platform of ridding <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of its immigrants and cracking down on law and order. In the Ariege, despite its leftist tradition, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> won 10.3 percent. It's hard to find somebody who will own up to voting for the extreme right and many Fuxiens, as local residents are called, were looking suspiciously at their neighbors last week. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouch </PERSON> lounged on a bench in <LOCATION> Foix </LOCATION>'s packed criminal court, wearing the traditional black bailiff's robe. A crowd waited for the jury to return its verdict in a sensational local murder case. `` The Ariege is a place where we live well,'' he said. `` There is no pollution, no racism. There is unemployment, yes ... but we live well. I do n't know about <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>. It's a rejection phenomenon.'' Despite the lack of enthusiasm for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, polls after the first round show him winning the runoff by scores ranging from 53-47 percent to 57-43 percent. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> `` still represents a popular image that no other political group can match,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saez </PERSON>, just before the jury convicted his client and sentenced her to 12 years in prison for bludgeoning her husband to death. In the Cafe de la Mairie on the night of the great debate between <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, most of the clientele sat in the back room drinking and socializing. Up front, where the debate was on the television, only a few folks paid attention. Lined up on a bench were four working-class men in their 30s and 40s, stonefaced, arms crossed. After the two-hour debate, they got up as a unit and left. One of them, in another typical French mannerism, expressed his opinion by filling his cheeks with air and letting it out with a soft puff. `` They're all the same.'' The next morning at the farmers' market, a peasant selling her cheese declared herself for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, but was hard put to explain why. `` We live on agricultural subsidies,'' she said. `` For peasants it's an absolute necessity.'' Has <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> threatened to cut subsidies? `` Well, you have the feeling that you are listened to under the left. Under the right, decisions are made without consultation, and that's it.''

<HEAD>Reagan Aides Recommend Veto of Benefits for `Atomic Veterans'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s advisers are recommending that he veto a bill which would grant some new benefits to `` atomic veterans,'' the American servicemen exposed to radiation in the 1945 occupation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or during post-World War II tests of nuclear weapons. The bill was sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved it Monday on a 326-2 vote, which would be far above the two-thirds majority needed to override any veto. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> margin last week was just 48-30, indicating that a veto could be sustained there. The Veterans Administration opposes the bill and says there is no direct evidence proving that the veterans' exposure is causing current health problems. The bill was part of a larger measure authorizing benefits for some 2.7 million veterans. But it was stripped out after administration officials said they would recommend a veto of the overall bill because of the `` atomic veterans'' provision. The measure would cover an estimated 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel who were in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bombs were dropped on those Japanese cities in August 1945, or who took part in open-air tests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons in the southern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> after the war. Many have health problems which they say are related to their radiation exposure. But the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says they ca n't get disability benefits unless they can show a direct link to their service duty The bill establishes a presumptive link and sets out 13 types of cancers for which the veterans could receive disability payments. According to Rep. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, D-Ga., the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has only allowed 44 of the 6,000 claims filed by atomic veterans The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. G.V. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., said the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s standard ca n't be met because `` the level of exposure can not be verified. He said that during the tests, some personnel did n't wear radiation-monitoring badges, other servicemen lost their badges and some badges were found to be ineffective. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, called the bill `` a reasonable and modest approach'' to the problem. `` If we err in our approach, and I think we do not, then we err on the side of compassion,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Delegations Discuss Building New Nuclear Power Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of a Soviet delegation says prospects are good for collaboration with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to develop new nuclear power reactors. The company, <ORGANIZATION> GA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, built the only working commercial gas-cooled reactor in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION> plant of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. A joint U.S.-Soviet committee on peaceful uses of atomic energy last week visited GA Technologies for talks on development of so-called modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. In a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday in which the heads of both delegations signed a document recommending renewal of the cooperation agreement, the Soviet chairman, <PERSON> Alexandor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON>, said, `` We think the prospects are very good for collaboration with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in this area, as well as with other companies.'' The agreement was begun by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in 1973. It was renewed in 1983 and 1985. Asked just what form cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> GA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> might take, <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON>, who is chairman of the state committee for the utilization of atomic energy, said through an interpreter the Soviet and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delegations were discussing `` a possible collaborative program with -LRB- the company -RRB- in the context of the general agreement.'' But, he added, `` We do n't exclude the possibility that our cooperation will lead to a time where we might have a separate agreement'' with GA Technologies. Gas-cooled reactors have been widely used in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but neither the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nor the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has favored them for civilian power. They do offer certain safety advantages, such as slow reaction to disturbances. Modular designs, which could be built efficiently in small sizes so utilities could add generating capacity only as needed, have attracted increasing attention both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the Soviets plan to complete construction of two in 1995. The modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is `` a good example of a safe, economically feasible new generation of reactor,'' <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON> said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is looking ahead to the November election with calls for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to provide more information about his role in the Iran-Contra affair and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Democratic front-runner also turned aside criticism from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but continued to avoid any sharp attacks on his Democratic rival. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today, after a day of primary-eve campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> where he held a substantial lead in the polls. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is holding a primary today too, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seen as sure to win there. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to prevent overconfidence in his camp, urged supporters to disregard the polls in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` This is not over,'' he said. `` It's very, very important that we get a big turnout.'' At the same time, though, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner was warming up for a fall campaign against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for foreign policy inexperience, and did so again Monday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in turn questioned the administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in other foreign policy matters including the Iran-Contra affair. `` This administration for the past 7 -LCB- years has broken the law. ... I think the vice president has to address the issue,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want to know why we were doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, why they were paying off <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, why they were doing business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` That's the first thing we need, a full explanation, and I think the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are entitled to it.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was promising to be `` the education president'' without saying whether he opposed administration cutbacks in college financial aid programs. `` I do n't know where the vice president stands on education,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if he has a program.'' In addition to criticism from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has come under increasing fire from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in recent days. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to respond directly. `` I hope we can keep it positive,'' he said upon arriving in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` While we have some differences, we respect each other.'' In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, responding to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s suggestion that he lacks leadership, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticked off his administration's accomplishments, including his state's 2.9 percent unemployment rate and legislation providing health care for all workers `` That's a lot of fire and a lot of productivity,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer. There's no question about my record.'' In an interview with Japanese television, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would try to negotiate a trade agreement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that accommodated both nations. He also called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase its aid to developing nations. `` I would also hope that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could do a great deal in Third World countries with its surpluses,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Deetz </PERSON> thought her traveling days were over when she was diagnosed as having emphysema. But this week she's packing for her third <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> cruise, accompanied by a hospital medical team. For the third year, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> is sending a doctor, nurses and therapists on a week-long cruise with a group of people with chronic lung diseases. The trip begins Sunday from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> with ports of call including <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION>. `` You might say we're all in the same boat,'' said the 73-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Deetz </PERSON>. `` We all have something in common. We understand each other's problems.'' Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON>, medical director of the hospital's <ORGANIZATION> Pulmonary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said many people with breathing problems are afraid to travel because of their unstable health `` They live for years with the anxiety of something happening suddenly,'' said <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON>, who went on the first two trips. `` Cruise lines are not equipped to handle complex medical illnesses and you ca n't expect them to be.'' He said the hospital-sponsored cruise developed after a patient brought up the problem of traveling. Besides the patient's fear, there's the problem of carrying oxygen supplies and other medical equipment along, he said. Some airlines and cruise lines wo n't allow the equipment, a situation that <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON> wants changed. `` Somehow we've got to set up a system to accommodate these people so they can live as near as normal lives as possible,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> plans the cruise with a supplier of home medical equipment that publicizes the trip among its customers. The first cruise drew about 25 people, including 17 patients. Last year, the group swelled to 80 people, about half patients, from more than a dozen states. The cost of the cruise ranges from $ 1,600 to $ 2,000. <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON> said this year's trip was almost canceled because of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> restrictions on portable oxygen tanks on cruise ships. But <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON> said an exemption was obtained to allow about three dozen to make the trip. Some past participants had n't traveled for years because of their health problems, said <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON>. `` For many of the patients, this is a goal,'' he said. The trip has many side effects as well, he added. `` It's humbling to see how this experience improves on the patient's sense of well being, achievement and independence,'' <PERSON> Nochomovitz </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Deetz </PERSON> said the first hospital-sponsored cruise gave her the confidence to continue traveling. She was found to have emphysema about four years ago, after returning from a trip to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. The cruise was her next trip. `` I thought -LRB- my travels -RRB- were over and that's why I jumped at the first cruise,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Deetz </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION>. Next week's cruise will be her fifth in three years, and she's planning a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this summer with one of her three sons She takes along a breathing machine for daily treatment. `` I enjoy the cruises. They're really wonderful for people like me,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 One day after a water rationing plan took effect, decorative fountains fell idle, bar tabs grew and plumbing supply stores reported brisk sales of water-saving devices. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> residents have been told to cut consumption by 25 percent in response to the area's most severe water shortage since the 1976-77 drought. But many of the cutbacks will be highly visible to the hundreds of thousands of tourists who crowd the City-By-The-Bay each summer. Only fountains that use recycled water _ like the one in front of City Hall _ continued to flow Monday. Others were still filled with water, but no longer sprayed it into the air or let it tumble from sculpted waterfalls. Restaurants no longer serve water to diners automatically. Many, like <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s Plum at <LOCATION> Ghirardelli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, have posted signs advising diners of the regulation. `` I would say right now, about one-quarter of the customers have asked for water,'' said dining director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> as he observed the popular restaurant's luncheon crowd. If one person at a table asks for water, only he gets water, said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. Business at the bar was up, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` At lunch, most people have a beverage. They have a drink, they have a little wine,'' he said. `` The only people who might complain are usually from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. You know, they do n't generally drink -LRB- alcohol -RRB- as much.'' Homeowners were snatching up plumbing supplies such as sink washers and flow-restricting shower heads. At the supermarket-like <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s Lumber store, plumbing manager <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said he was especially busy Sunday afternoon as customers sought ways to cut water use in their homes. He said people were especially interested in water-saving shower heads, which <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s stocks at prices ranging from $ 5 to $ 40. `` The expensive ones have more adjustments for the spray,'' <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said. `` We carry a flow restrictor kit -LRB- for about $ 3 -RRB-, but it seems like they're more interested in putting on a new head,'' he said. `` We're also selling a lot of washers. `` We're getting a lot of questions on what to do to save water,'' he said. `` They're bugging us pretty good on that.'' Meanwhile, city officials confirmed that 12 million gallons of water per year _ enough to supply 30,000 households _ are wasted cooling City Hall computers without any recycling system. The water is pumped continuously through four huge air conditioners that keep the temperature cool for the basement computers, city engineers said. The city <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> this week for an emergency fund to buy a water tower that would recycle the waste, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, public works director. The water has been dumped down the drain after one pass for 22 years, he said, explaining why no tower was built into the design. `` With technology what it is, a water cooling tower 10 years ago might have been the size of City Hall,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Residents wo n't know exactly how much water they need to save until mid-May. City officials will send a notice to each household telling them how many gallons they used during an average month during the past year and, hence, how much they need to save 25 percent. City officials actually expect people to cut their personal use by 10 percent and reduce outdoor uses _ like car washing and lawn watering _ by 60 percent. Residents who do n't save enough will pay premium prices for the extra water they use. Anyone who does n't think their allotment is fair can appeal. Although there was a chance of rain in the forecast for today, water officials said it's highly unlikely <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> will get enough rain this season to make up for its extremely dry winter.

<HEAD>Through Writing, Ex-Mental Patient Finds A Cure</HEAD>

 Some people write as a hobby, scribbling in journals or dashing off verse and short stories for nothing more than their own pleasure. Others, be they authors of flashy ad campaigns, creators of TV sitcoms or this year's <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, are blessed with enough talent and good fortune to do it for money. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, a mental patient-turned-poet and songwriter, uses his typewriter to exorcise the demons that led him to two nervous breakdowns and a bout with alcoholism. `` It's been the real savior for me, writing,'' he says, `` because it gave me a chance to bring out my inner feelings.'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, is the author of `` Deep Within,'' a recently published collection of poetry, and a gospel music album, `` Polished by the Master,'' to be released this month. His voice deliberate and thoughtful, his eyes lively, there's little in <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>'s demeanor to suggest his rocky past But his work is the culmination of a journey that began 28 years ago at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. That's where <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> was stationed when he suffered his first nervous breakdown. Although granted an honorable discharge after observation by military officials, he soon checked into a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> mental hospital in <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION>. The doctors diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic: He suffered from feelings of persecution marked by flights of fantasy, illogical thinking and hallucinations. `` I would be depressed one moment, then I'd go to another extreme and be as high as a kite,'' he said. He spent three months in locked confinement. Then another patient suggested he enter a Hospitalized Veterans Writing Project contest. Reluctantly, he submitted an article. Then another, and some short stories and poetry. Nearly all focused on his illness. One poem, `` The Apple,'' read in part: `` Take an apple from a tree; Pretend that apple is me; Now cut the apple in half, Hear one part cry, one part laugh!'' He won some prizes, but that was n't the important thing. Putting the words down seemed to release something within him. `` The more I wrote, the better I felt,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. In 1965, after five years of hospitalization, he was discharged. `` I literally wrote myself out of the hospital,'' he said. Two years later, he met and married <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, his wife of 21 years. He suffered another nervous breakdown and was hospitalized for three months in 1972, but he has n't been back in the hospital. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>'s work has appeared in numerous poetry anthologies, and he has published two collections of short stories. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, whose G & amp; G Publishers of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> published `` Deep Within,'' remembered his first impression of <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>'s poetry. `` He was almost like an inner soul crying out,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` There was something there that really sort of got to me.'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> does n't expect his efforts to make him rich. But he figures he's already done pretty well. `` I want to tell people what I went through so it may help someone else who may say, ` Well, this is the end. I had a nervous breakdown, and this is the end of the world,''' he said. `` But it is n't the end. It's just the beginning.''

<TEXT>
 Japanese authorities on Tuesday investigated the apparent engine failures that caused a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet with 258 people aboard to make an emergency landing with only one of its four engines working. The plane landed safely Monday after two of the engines stopped over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the third stopped just before the landing, an airline official said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, quoting airport and airline officials it did not identify, said the pilot shut off the engines after noticing problems with fuel gauges. It was not known if that meant the plane was running out of fuel. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Katsuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> said emergency vehicles stood by at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 taxied to the terminal under its own power. None of the 239 passengers and 19 crew members on the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-Tokyo </LOCATION> flight was injured, he said. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Flight 97 was 39,000 feet above the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and about 125 miles from <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> when the first engine stopped, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> said that half an hour later, 45 minutes before landing, the second engine stopped and the pilot radioed the <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> control tower for an `` expedited approach.'' The third engine stopped shortly before the plane landed at 3:17 p.m. Passenger <PERSON> Shinobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Murota </PERSON>, 21, said flight attendants ordered people to put on life jackets as the plane approached <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and said they might have to make an emergency landing. `` A few minutes later the sound of the engine suddenly stopped, and I felt as if the plane was floating in the air like a hang glider,'' Ms. <PERSON> Murota </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Passengers cheered and applauded when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-100 settled on the runway, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I expected death at any moment,'' it quoted <PERSON> Kazuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> as saying. Mrs. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, who was returning from her honeymoon, shouted at her husband when the plane landed: `` Thank goodness we did n't die!'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said the safe landing did not surprise him. `` Almost any aircraft we have is capable of operating on one engine,'' he said. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said he did not know of another 747 losing power in three engines. A <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, said in its Tuesday editions that while the jumbo jet was some 120 miles from <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> control tower authorities at the airport received the following message from the pilot: `` Out of the four main engines, the condition of No. 1 and No. 4 engines at both ends is bad and I want to make an emergency landing.'' The newspaper account added, `` According to the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport office and the airline, during the flight the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engine from the fuel tank showed there was almost no fuel going into engines number 1 and 4 and that the No. 3 engine was also malfunctioning. `` For this reason, the pilot turned off the number 1 and 4 engines at about 2:00 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. -LRB- Tuesday local time -RRB- consecutively. After requesting emergency landing permission from control authorities, he turned off engine 3 just before beginning to glide in for a landing.'' A statement released by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said in part that about one hour and 15 minutes before the jetliner landed `` it lost power in one of the four engines. About 30 minutes later they lost power to a second engine. And just before landing they lost power to a third engine. The plane landed safely and taxied to the terminal under its own power where the passengers deplaned in a normal fashion. The cause of the incident is still under investigtion.'' The mishap occurred several hours after the government urged Japanese airlines to ground and do maintenance checks on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jets of the model that lost part of its fuselage last week on an inter-island flight in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s engineering deparment said the 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are operated by <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> and the airline <PERSON> Nansei </PERSON> <PERSON> Koku </PERSON>.

 Police say they'll try to work with groups planning demonstrations during this summer's Democratic National Convention but warn that space is limited and that protests will have to be scheduled. Only five groups have applied so far for demonstration permits during the July convention, but many more are expected. `` We assume we'll have a lot of diverse groups here and, to the extent we can accommodate them, we plan to,'' said Deputy Chief W.J. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` We do n't want anyone to feel they are not welcome.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> charged last week that was exactly what was happening, and threatened legal action unless the city clarified the procedures it intends to follow for handling protest groups. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s key complaint is that the city has not adopted rules and procedures for permitting demonstrations, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudney </PERSON>, a staff attorney for the organization's <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> chapter, said Monday. She also contended that the city has not said whether it intends to adhere to existing rules requiring seven days' notice for street marches and 30 days' notice to hold political gatherings in parks. In addition, some city officials have indicated that downtown parks will not be available for demonstrations, she said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said those problems are being addressed. `` The problem is, there's not that much available space,'' he said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the city is trying to secure two parking lots directly across from The Omni, the convention site, to serve as staging areas for demonstrations. Some downtown parks also may be used, he said. The advance-notice rules for street demonstrations and park use will be waived, he said, so long as organized groups have obtained permits. No applications have been processed yet, and none will be acted on until June, he said. Those already seeking permits are the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krishna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consciousness </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Lenora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fulani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which supports Ms. <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>'s New York-based <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> campaign for the presidency; a committee supporting legislative equality for homosexuals; a local group calling itself `` Arts Pluribus Unum''; and another local group called Alternative 88. The group was formed by the owners of the Metroplex nightclub in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Partner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleter </PERSON> said the group is designed to serve as `` a loose coordinating group for different groups that will be raising First Amendment and alternative issues.''

 Artist <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s painting, `` The Search,'' believed to be his last canvas, fetched $ 4.84 million _ a record for a work of contemporary art _ in frenzied bidding at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s Monday night, the auction house said. The auction, which included works put up for sale by various owners as well as artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s personal collection, brought in $ 25,954,500, a record for an auction of contemporary art, said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell-Innes </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s contemporary art department. Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, Cy Twombly, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hockney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diebenkorn </PERSON>. Six paintings sold for over $ 1 million, she said. `` The contemporary -LRB- art -RRB- world is now extremely aware of the rarity of these really important paintings,'' she said. `` People are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings wo n't come up again. People know this is their last shot.'' `` I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this evening,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell-Innes </PERSON>. The auction of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s personal collection of contemporary art brought in $ 5,115,000, with an untitled painting by Twombly fetching $ 990,000, the highest bid for a Warhol-owned work. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s `` Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow, black and white, was bought for $ 4.84 million by an anonyous Japanese dealer, Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell-Innes </PERSON> said. The work, which displays the artist's drip technique as well as paint applied with a brush and spattered, had a pre-sale estimate of $ 3 million to $ 4 million. The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at auction was the $ 3.63 million for <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s `` Out the Window'' in November 1986 and the same amount for <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON>'s `` Pink Lady'' in May 1987. Both paintings were sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The second highest bid at Monday night's auction was the $ 1.87 million an American dealer paid for <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>'s `` Ninth Street,'' a black and white abstraction, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. Its pre-sale estimate was $ 700,000 to $ 900,000.

 The stalemate that doomed <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s latest meeting also dimmed prospects for creating a new global alliance of oil producers. The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says it will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties with other oil producers. But the going is likely to be slow. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> wants to persuade as many independent producers as possible to join the cartel in restraining production as a means of getting prices up to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s official target of $ 18 a barrel. <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, said on Monday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> there was `` unanimous recognition in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'' that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> alone can not keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from lagging. Last week a group of six independent producers, led by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, met with a committee of six <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers and presented an offer: we'll cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise. The two groups issued a joint communique declaring `` the beginning of a new stage of cooperation'' among some of the biggest oil-producing countries in the world. But that's as far as it went. The non-OPEC officials left town and all 13 of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers spent four days debating the offer, only to suspend the talks after falling into a bitter impasse. Cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting the non-OPEC offer, they just wanted more time to think it over. The offer, by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, was for two months of production cuts only, starting May 1. Now that the starting date has passed and the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders have gone home, there is little chance the two groups will get back to considering joint production cuts before next year. That's because oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this year, eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the problem of sharing any cutbacks. This is likely to be welcomed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has publicly campaigned against what he called efforts to create a `` world <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Even so, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> says it will try to keep alive a dialogue with non-OPEC exporters, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which ranks as the world's largest oil producer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the No. 2 producer. `` It is important that we keep talking to them,'' <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president, said of the six independent exporters who met in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` The opportunity given to us is one that we can not take lightly.'' The reasons are obvious. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s capacity for influencing oil prices has been gradually eroded by the emergence of new oil producers in all corners of the globe. Ironically, it was the sudden and severe increases in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil prices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive for countries to step up the search for oil. In recent years <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and many other nations have joined the ranks of oil exporters. As production outside its control steadily rose, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> reluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to prevent prices from falling. Today the cartel pumps about 17.5 million barrels a day, compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily. In that same period, non-OPEC output has jumped from about 22 million barrels daily to more than 28 million. This year alone, non-OPEC oil output is expected to rise by 800,000 barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s probably will not grow at all. All oil exporters naturally want to get as much for their product as possible. But they seem to have little prospect for overcoming the political and economic differences that make formal cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> hard to achieve. `` There just is n't a community of interest between them,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a London-based oil consultant. `` You're either a member of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> or not; nobody's knocking down the door to join <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.''

 After three weeks in the nation's movie theaters, the gang film `` Colors'' has moved past `` Beetlejuice'' as the No. 1 box office attraction. `` Colors,'' with <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> as a cocky rookie cop teamed with the savvy veteran <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, nearly tripled its coverage last weekend _ from 480 screens to 1,372 _ and took in $ 6.5 million in its third week of release while the comedy `` Beetlejuice'' dropped to second with a $ 5 million take. After the top two finishers, box office receipts plummeted.

 Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> on Monday accepted a written apology to the public from an aide whose religious slurs prompted aldermen and others to demand his dismissal. But <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said the apology might not be sufficient. `` I humbly apologize to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> residents of all races and religious groups who were offended by remarks made prior to my ascension to the mayor's office,'' said a letter signed by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>, a $ 35,000-a-year mayoral aide. `` I have, since working in the mayor's office, respected all those I have had the privilege to serve,'' added the apology, distributed by the mayor's office. `` No one has accused me of abusing the privilege of working for Mayor <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. Mayor <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has discussed with me, in a firm and gentlemanly manner, what he expects from all employees of the mayor's office.'' Later Monday at a gathering of Jewish business leaders, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said: `` This afternoon, a young man issued an apology that might not be sufficient ... We will not tolerate an individual with views of this type. `` We are reviewing the situation, and we will have something to say about it in the very near future,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> called Monday for the immediate ouster of the 35-year-old aide. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisendrath </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would take up the matter next week if the mayor fails to act. <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>, who serves as a liaison to black nationalist groups, said in four tape-recorded lectures before the Chicago-based Nation of Islam between August 1985 and November 1987 that Jewish doctors were guilty of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus and that a Christian crucifix is a symbol of white supremacy, according to published reports over the weekend.

<HEAD>Food Chemicals, New Type Of Egg Can Control Heart-Threatening

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have developed eggs that do n't raise human cholesterol levels like regular eggs, and are trying to prevent heart disease by identifying food chemicals that reduce blood cholesterol Both efforts at making diets healthier were outlined Monday at the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. Suk Y. Oh, an associate professor of nutrition, and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> added fish oil to chicken feed. Hens that ate the oil-enriched feed for eight weeks laid eggs that reduced blood pressure and blood fats in a group of 12 people and, unlike regular eggs, did n't raise cholesterol levels. The eggs taste and smell like fish, but Oh said that can probably be avoided by feeding hens deodorized fish oil. If Oh's preliminary findings are confirmed in a larger study, `` consumption of such eggs will not increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease'' no matter how many are consumed, he said. Oh said fish oil-enriched eggs could join existing low-cholesterol egg substitutes in markets by summer 1989, but because of the price of fish oil, the eggs would probably cost about 40 percent more than regular eggs. The American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> recommends people eat no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily because high levels of the fat-like substance in blood are linked to increased risk of hardening of the arteries, heart attacks and strokes. A regular egg averages 274 milligrams of cholesterol. In the other study, nutritional sciences professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Elson </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> found that daily consumption of 140-milligram capsules of lemongrass oil, a spice common in <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> food, reduced blood cholesterol more than 10 percent in more than one-third of a small group of people with unhealthy high levels. <PERSON> Elson </PERSON> now is testing other foods containing chemicals called isoprenoids to learn if they also can inhibit the body's formation of cholesterol from simpler fats. `` We're looking in beer, wine, citrus peel and oats,'' he said. `` We've found a compound in barley. Any green plant has similar compounds, and some also are in milk. If we're correct, we could create a diet composed of a variety of foods containing factors that work together to control cholesterol.'' For now, people should eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruits to `` have ready access to compounds that will help block or reduce cholesterol synthesis'' in the body, <PERSON> Elson </PERSON> said. Oh and his colleagues fed hens fish oil-enriched chicken feed because the oil contains omega-3 fatty acids. Previous studies suggest people who consume cold-water fish, which contain omega-3 fatty acids, enjoy a lower risk of heart attack and stroke. In Oh's study, 12 healthy people with normal blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides _ fatty substances that also contribute to heart disease _ were divided into two groups. Each person ate four eggs daily for eight weeks. The first group ate fish oil-enriched eggs for the first four weeks, which significantly reduced their blood pressure and kept blood cholesterol virtually unchanged. When they switched to regular eggs for the last four weeks, their cholesterol levels increased 5 percent to 10 percent, their blood pressure rose to normal and their triglyceride levels rose significantly. The second group started on regular eggs, which boosted their blood cholesterol significantly. When they switched to fishy eggs, their cholesterol levels dropped to normal and their blood pressure and triglyceride levels fell significantly.

 The city's finest probably wo n't win any fashion contests with a new uniform they're testing, but at least they wo n't have to shine their shoes, crease their pants or polish their gunbelt buckles. `` It's quite different, but it does n't look that different,'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said Monday as two nervous-looking police officers modeled the new threads. The new uniform will be worn by 135 officers citywide for the next year.

The changes reflect <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s busy lifestyle that calls for minimal upkeep, and includes machine washable shirts; pants with a permanent crease; shoes that do n't need to be shined and a gunbelt with a non-tarnish buckle. The new jacket, a lightweight poly-wool blend, has four gold-plated buttons to give it the appearance of a dress coat, but is actually closed by a concealed plastic zipper with a Velcro closure. `` You do n't lose the buttons, and yet you have the traditional appearance of the buttons,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said approvingly. The most visible change is the placement of the Police Department patch on both sleeves of the duty jacket, raincoat and shirts. Currently officers wear the patch only on their right shoulders. `` On the old uniform, if you happened to be facing the wrong way, you would n't know whether this was a police officer or a private security guard in a dark suit,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. As usual, convenience does n't come cheap. The new uniform costs $ 476, versus the $ 350 for the current uniform. `` This is a great improvement over what I wore,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said, recalling that his leather uniform coat `` was heavy and it was n't warm.

<HEAD>Arthritis Gene Identified In Mice; Early Step Toward Human Cure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers seeking to cure crippling diseases like arthritis and multiple sclerosis in humans say they've taken an early, important step by isolating the gene that causes a form of arthritis in mice. `` We are on the way to finding the cure for this type of arthritis in mice,'' <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON>, a molecular biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said Monday. If the same kinds of arthritis-causing genes _ or inherited blueprints _ can be identified in humans, `` we are one step closer to the cure and prevention of human rheumatoid arthritis and other human auto-immune diseases'' in which the body apparently is attacked by its own disease-fighting immune system, <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON> said. Discovery of the gene Vb6 that causes mouse arthritis was outlined by <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON> during the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION>, which drew 22,000 scientists and exhibitors. The discovery is `` very exciting'' because it is the first time scientists have isolated a gene that causes arthritis, said Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON>, an immunologist-rheumatologist at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But he said it still will take scientists years to find a cure for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 7 million Americans, or any of the other 100 forms of arthritis and related diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis and juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes. <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> recently used what are called monoclonal antibodies, proteins made in the laboratory to target specific types of cells, to attack T cells _ a type of white blood cell in the immune system _ that cause diabetes in mice. The mice were cured, he reported Friday in the journal Science. <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON> is now trying to cure mice of arthritis by using other tailor-made monoclonal antibodies to attack the T cells responsible for that disease without harming other white blood cells, which are needed to defend the body against infection. T cells normally help fight infection by recognizing an invading germ or foreign substance and then triggering production of antibodies to combat them. But bacterial and viral infections also can trigger auto-immune diseases. <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON> and his colleagues identified and isolated the gene that codes for production of a certain receptor on the surface of T cells in mice. <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON> said this receptor causes the T cells to lose their ability to distinguish foreign collagen, or connective tissue, from the collagen naturally found in cartilage, tendon and skin. So the T cells attack collagen in cartilage in the mice's joints, causing the inflammation, swelling and pain known as arthritis Scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> also worked on the study, in which mice developed arthritis when injected with collagen from cows. The disease is similar to crippling rheumatoid arthritis in humans. If researchers can identify the genes for human T cell receptors that go awry to cause human arthritis and other auto-immune diseases, `` then we can cure the disease'' and prevent it by producing monoclonal antibodies to attack the culprit T cells while leaving other white blood cells unharmed, <PERSON> Haqqi </PERSON> said. But, he cautioned, `` the antibody that works in mice may not work in humans, so we'll have to find the antibody that works in humans.'' <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> agreed, saying different monoclonal antibodies would be needed not only for every form of arthritis and auto-immune disease, but possibly for each individual human.

The Health and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Samchully </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> received a permit to manufacture and export Azidothymidine -LRB- AZT -RRB-. But domestic sales of the drug will not be allowed until clinical tests are completed, the ministry said. The drug, first developed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as an anti-cancer drug, can lengthen the lives of patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome by restraining development of the virus that causes the disease. Export plans call for producing the drug at about half the international price of $ 155 for 100 milligrams, officials said. Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are expected to begin as early as next month, they said. Plans call for exporting about $ 10 million worth of AZT annually.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said today that scratches found in the memorial, one resembling a swastika, appear to be random vandalism and not the work of someone trying to make a political statement. `` It looks like the random defacement that happens to memorials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from time to time,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>. `` The memorial has had about 24 million visitors and only one bad egg.'' The vandalism is the first since the memorial opened in 1982, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. The 493-foot granite wall inscribed with 58,156 names of those killed in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> conflict has become the most visited monument in the nation's capital `` The wall itself has such great respect that we have never had problems with damage,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruback </PERSON>, superintendent of national parks in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It had to be someone crazy to do this.'' <PERSON> Ruback </PERSON> said he believed the marks were an act of vandalism. `` Someone stood here and did this on purpose,'' he said, noting that hard objects such as cameras and women's purses often strike the wall without causing any damage. The scratches, about eight inches long, were discovered on a center panel and on a panel near the east end of the memorial early last month. `` We worried about vandalism from the time we began to talk about a memorial,'' said <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, head of the organization that raised money to build the memorial. <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> said he has contacted a specialist in polished surfaces to come to inspect the scratches, which he said are not deep. Any necessary repairs will be the responsibility of both the fund and the federal government, said <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> said he will also offer a $ 1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever committed the vandalism.

<TEXT>
 A proposed bypass road in eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has caused a battle between conservationists who want to save the habitat of a rare moth and people who want heavy traffic diverted from their village. Six hundred residents from the village of <LOCATION> Dersingham </LOCATION> marched 1 -LCB- miles on Monday to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Sandringham </LOCATION> estate in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> to demand that work begin on the bypass, which they first called for 25 years ago.

A group called the <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the road could wipe out the moth, <PERSON> Choristoneura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafauryana </PERSON>, by destroying the bog where it breeds.

<HEAD>Engineer Says Uncertain If Civil War Ship Monitor Should Be
Salvaged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An engineer studying the sunken Civil War ship USS Monitor says it could cost $ 20 million to raise the ironclad vessel from its 125-year-old grave off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a corrosion and metallurgical engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hueneme </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also said that federal officials are uncertain whether to raise the ship. `` Personally, I'd like to make sure anything done there is done carefully so we do n't waste the 120 years that it's been down there,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said Monday at the Offshore Technology Conference here. `` We really do n't know today what could or should be done.'' Already, $ 3 million has been spent on research, and estimates of costs to raise the ship range from $ 10 million to $ 20 million, he said. `` There are major structural components, like the armored deck, the turret, the guns, the engine and the boilers, that appear to be relatively intact and probably could be retrieved,'' he said. On New Year's Eve 1862, the USS Monitor sank in a storm off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>. Nine months earlier, on March 9, 1862, it battled the Confederate vessel Merrimack to a draw in the first combat between two ironclad ships. Neither ship was able to inflict serious damage on the other in the battle, which occurred at <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The Merrimack, renamed the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> by the Confederates, was scuttled two months later when Southern forces abandoned the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> navy yard. The Merrimack was discovered in 1910, its armored plates retrieved and sold as souvenirs, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want that to happen to the Monitor, to have pieces of it on the end of keychains,'' he said. `` We do n't want people going in and we do n't want souvenir hunters, a la the Titanic.'' The Monitor suffered extensive damage while being depth-charged during World War II when it mistakenly was believed to be a German submarine. It was not until 1973 that <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers said they believed the wreck was the Monitor. Photographs made two years later confirmed that. Last year, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> coordinated a corrosion survey of the Monitor, using Norwegian-made electronic probes attached to remote-controlled underwater gear. The probes normally are used to test the corrosion of offshore drilling rigs and the investigation of the Monitor marked one of the first times oilfield technology was applied to marine archeology, he said. The Monitor is in about 230 feet of water, upside down, with its two-gun turret _ made of foot-thick wrought iron and weighing 120 tons _ supporting about 90 feet of the deck above the sea floor. Although corrosion has set in, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said, it's important to note that less than one-half inch of material has been lost. `` Corrosion rates tend to drop over long periods of time,'' he said. As an engineer, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said the wreck is significant because it provides corrosion data over 120 years. The wreck in 1975 was designated the first National Marine Sanctuary. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said technology exists to preserve what it left of the ship or the debris around the vessel could be retrieved or officials can take no action at all. `` We have a lot more plans than money,'' he said. `` Its value is as a fingerprint of society and a fingerprint of shipbuilding in the 1860s.''

<HEAD>Reports Of U.S. Deal With Noriega Alarm Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition party leaders said they were alarmed by reports of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deal that would force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as head of the military but allow him to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In another development, an official of the bilateral commission that runs the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> said the waterway continues to do a thriving business despite the nation's protracted economic and political crisis. The opposition leaders discussed the reported deal Monday at what they called their first meeting since <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis began nearly a year ago. `` We met to discuss jointly the grave situation of our country and what we may do together to find a democratic solution for our country,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who held the two-hour meeting at his home. The opposition wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the power behind the civilian government, to resign as commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and leave the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> designed to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and has called for him to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political leaders say it would be a mistake if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backed off that stance. The sanctions, which have caused an economic crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, were imposed after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges. Following Monday's meeting some of the opposition leaders said they were alarmed by reports of a deal that would allow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The leaders discussed `` everything that has to do with the serious crisis,'' including the reported arrangement between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said one source at the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> agreed to step down as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> but refused to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continued during the weekend and that `` progress is being made.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied on Saturday he had reached any agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Sources in the opposition say their leaders are afraid the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is bypassing them and ignoring promises to them. They say if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> quits but remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> he will continue to wield power through the Defense Forces. `` He would continue to be a focus of controversy,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said Monday. The Christian Democrats, the second largest opposition party, called Monday's meeting. Also attending were representatives of the Authentic Panamanian Party, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and Labor parties. The Authentic Panamanian Party is the largest opposition party followed by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed Feb. 26, the day after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Such concerns have not reduced traffic in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. `` Business is almost embarrassingly high,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON>, chief of economic research and market development for the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He said on Monday that the canal is running smoothly because neither the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` wants to jeopardize operation of the canal.'' Five Americans and five Panamanians make up the commission, established under 1977 treaties that will turn the canal ove to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999. During the first five months of fiscal 1988, toll revenues came to $ 143.6 million, $ 4.6 million higher than anticipated. <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON> said he expects income to match expenses the rest of the year.

North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel who is accused of illegally diverting money from <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> arms deals to the Nicaraguan Contras, delivered the commencement address Monday at <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` He's already been convicted in much of the national media,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of about 12,000. `` He's already guilty. The first question's always asked: Why are you having an indicted man to speak to the students of <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>? I said, ` Well, we serve a savior who was indicted and convicted and crucified.''' <PERSON> North </PERSON> told the crowd that he had asked his daughter to forgive his accusers, and said he never intended to get caught in a political war between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` From certain commentaries in the media, it is clear that some believe once a man is accused, he's branded forever,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` Well, I've been accused of helping the brave young men and women of the Nicaraguan resistance in their struggle for the very liberties we claim as birthright. `` I've been accused of trying to rescue American hostages, held captive, and trying to prevent other terrorist attacks. Those accusations are not a brand. They are a badge of honor.'' The crowd chanted `` Ollie, <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>,'' as <PERSON> North </PERSON>, wearing a black and purple academic robe, marched to the stage placed in front of a huge American flag in Liberty's baseball park. He was given an honorary doctorate in the humanities. Conservatives seeking to draft <PERSON> North </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat being vacated by Republican <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> listened for clues that <PERSON> North </PERSON> might like the idea.

North, whose retirement from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> became effective this week, told the students they should be grateful for the opportunities they have as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. `` As you leave <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, you can be anything you want to be,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` As your counterparts are graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>, they can be anything the state wants them to be.'' While <PERSON> North </PERSON> addressed the audience, peace activists staged an anti-North demonstration in downtown <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>. Also, members of People for the American Way came to Liberty to hand out a statement saying they opposed <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s effort to get North pardoned. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said Monday he has collected 600,000 of the 2 million signatures he wants for a petition calling on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to pardon North. `` The issue is n't whether <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is innocent or guilty; it's whether the president and his staff are above the law,'' said the group's president, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>.

 A judge has dismissed a lawsuit against rock star <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> by his half sister who alleged he used her lyrics in violation of copyright laws.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> high school marching band today became the first foreign musical group to perform on Tiananmen Square, the vast plaza in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that is one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most important sites The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fairless </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, gave a brief concert before hundreds of Chinese and foreign sightseers in the square, which is ringed by the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s Mausoleum, and the Great Hall of the People, the seat of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government. Five members of the honor guard laid a wreath at the foot of the Martyrs' Shrine in the center of the square before the band played. The monument honors those who died fighting Japanese invaders and Nationalist troops in the 1940s. The 170-member band stood in formation at the base of the monument and played the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> national anthems and the song `` Brotherhood'' but did not march. One band organizer said they were not allowed to march because the square is sacred ground. Several hundred <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sightseers watched the performance, but most were more interested in taking each other's pictures or lining up to see <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s mausoleum, which is behind the monument. The audience listened impassively to the three songs and did not clap.

 A premature baby so small she could fit in her mother's hand when she was born has gone home from the hospital _ cradled in her mother's arms. <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> weighed only 15 ounces and was 10 -LCB- inches long when she was born three months premature on Jan. 11 at <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. She left the hospital for her home in <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> on Monday, weighing 4-pounds, 10 ounces, and measuring 15 inches. `` It is remarkable the way she has caught up in growth,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, who delivered <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON>, the smallest surviving premature baby in the hospital's 46-year history. `` I consider her a miracle baby.''

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Blood Cells Increase Before Disease Develops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of white blood cells infected by the AIDS virus rises sharply in the year before virus-infected males actually develop the disease, says a study that may lead to speedier treatment for AIDS victims. While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> is trying to develop a simpler test that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown AIDS, said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. Such a test would help doctors decide when the benefits of giving patients certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks, said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volberding </PERSON>, associate professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and AIDS program director at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point, even if he had n't developed full-blown AIDS,'' he said. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s clinical immunology chief, presented her findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing blood cells from 15 homosexual <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> men who were infected by the virus and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but did n't suffer AIDS. Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said. She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells _ a class of white blood cells. If a simple test could show that someone infected with the virus soon will get AIDS, doctors could better decide when to prescribe AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections that kill AIDS patients once the virus has crippled their immune systems, <PERSON> Volberding </PERSON> said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is believed to slow progression of AIDS. From a scientific standpoint, `` learning what a person's risk of developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,'' he said. But <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Volberding </PERSON> acknowledged that some AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will develop disease symptoms. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said researchers previously knew that people infected with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting white blood cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection progresses. Her study found that the number of helper cells decreases more quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in infected patients who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms. `` It's not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will develop disease,'' she said, adding that her findings point the way toward determining which patients are likely to do so. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991.

 The cocaine-smuggling trial of reputed Colombian drug lord <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> could go to the jury next week, after his lawyers shocked the courtroom by resting their case without calling witnesses. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> scheduled closing arguments to begin next Monday, and attorneys estimated they could last up to three days. The judge also denied a defense motion Monday to sequester the jury during closing arguments, which defense attorneys complained will come during `` Just Say No To Drugs Week.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his private island, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. A federal indictment names <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as one of the leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a bonanza worth $ 8 billion each year. Defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> stunned the courtroom Monday when he announced the defense would rest without calling any witnesses to counter the 115 prosecution witnesses who testified during a 22-week period. He refused to discuss the move with reporters. `` You could honestly say I looked surprised and stunned,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said later. The jury did not show any visible reaction. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbaum </PERSON>, an attorney for co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, also rested without calling any witnesses. That tactic is used by defense attorneys `` to keep the sufficiency of the government's case at issue,'' <PERSON> Weinbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy; possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; importation of cocaine; and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy. If convicted of all 11 counts, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> could be sentenced to a maximum sentence of life plus 165 years. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> would face a possible 15 year-sentence. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also is also charged in separate indictments in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 Rescuers recovered three more bodies today from the wreckage of a children's hospital annex that collapsed in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The discovery raised the official death toll to 17. UNI quoted hospital authorities as saying as many as 32 people, including 22 children, were still unaccounted for and that the death toll could rise. <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said rescuers were losing hope of finding anyone alive. `` It is a terrible sight up here,'' he said. `` No one knows how many children have died or are dying.'' Rescue workers pulled 30 people alive from the rubble of the three-story hospital wing on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Twenty-three of them, mostly children, were being treated at a makeshift emergency center, state-run <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Civilians, police and army units with cranes today removed blocks of concrete and brick at the site. R.S. Chib, the state's health minister, told <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> he expected rescue operations to be completed tonight The collapse of several wards in the hospital annex was blamed on structural defects. The Statesman newspaper said four wards collapsed in the wing of the hospital, which was built four years ago. The newspaper said each ward had 17 beds and some contained more than one child. In addition to hospital staff, parents and relatives were attending some of the children when the accident occurred, the paper said. In <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, a city of 500,000 more than 300 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, most stores and businesses closed today in sympathy for the victims and their families. Stores also were reported closed in neighboring towns. <PERSON> Satish </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> police department spokesman, said the collapse apparently was caused by a weak foundation under the hospital wing. The older wing of the hospital was still standing. <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON> said cracks had developed over the weekend in the ground floor walls. He said one doctor told him the cracks widened Sunday and he evacuated 35 children. The three civil engineers who oversaw construction of the hospital wing have been suspended, news reports said. They did not elaborate.

 A string of price records for contemporary artists, including <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, fell in frenzied bidding at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s that fetched nearly $ 26 million, the auction house said. `` I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this evening,'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell-Innes </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s contemporary art department said after Monday night's sale. The highest price bid was the $ 4.84 million an anonymous Japanese dealer paid for <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s `` The Search,'' believed to be his last canvas, Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell-Innes </PERSON> said. It was a record for a work of contemporary art, as well as a record for the artist, she said. The auction of works put up for sale by various owners as well as from <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s personal collection brought in $ 25,954,500, a record for an auction of contemporary art, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official says the ex-chairman of the scandal-plagued defense contractor once suggested killing another official insured by the company for $ 15 million. But <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorten </PERSON>, testifying Monday at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six others, said he never took the suggested murder plot seriously. Shorten, once <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, is one of four former company officials to plead guilty to state and federal charges, and was the second to testify at the trial in exchange for leniency. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and five others are accused of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, now in bankruptcy proceedings, into a racketeering enterprise that made millions of dollars in payoffs to secure government contracts. Under cross-examination by the defense, Shorten admitted that after he and other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives forced <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> out of the company in 1985, they kept paying premiums for a $ 15 million insurance policy on <LOCATION> Mariotta </LOCATION> despite <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems. Shorten, however, denied that another <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON>, wanted to keep up the policy `` because it might come in handy.'' `` But he did say that if <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> died the company could use the $ 15 million?'' pressed <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Glekel </PERSON>. `` He did make that statement, yes,'' said Shorten. The witness said <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> called him in late 1985 to talk about a conversation with then-Wedtech Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON>. `` I think he said to the effect, ` Wait till you hear this one.' I said ` What?' He said, ` Freddie came up with the bright idea to knock off <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>.' `` I said to him: You are not serious?' He says, ` No, I just thought you'd want to know that <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> made that statement.''' <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> are expected to testify for the government. The defense has been trying to depict them and other former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials as liars and thieves who have admitted crimes far more serious than the ones <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and his co-defendants are accused of. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, another one of the four cooperating <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials, testified earlier that <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> suggested hiring an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hitman to kill <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>. Shorten said <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> often boasted of having connections with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hitman. `` He said he could take care of everything, he could hire a ` consultant from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,' but it had nothing to do with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>. It was more joking than anything else,'' said Shorten. Shorten said later that local Teamsters officials suggested killing <LOCATION> Mariotta </LOCATION> in March 1986. `` They said it could be done for $ 50,000,'' said Shorten. `` We rejected it out of hand, that it was a crazy thought, that we would n't get involved in anything like that.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> has testified that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> paid off Teamsters officials for labor peace and that a union leader offered to `` eliminate'' <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> because they were afraid he might `` spill the beans'' on the payoffs. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also testified that most of the executives rejected the idea, although he said <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> complained they were acting like `` Boy Scouts.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> ordered a fraternity to disband for five years for a rape of a teen-age student at the fraternity house and subsequent cover-up, officials said. `` I hope what we're doing sends out a message we do take this very seriously,'' Dean of Students <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said Monday. `` The nature of the whole incident was so serious that to be responsible you have to take action.'' University officials accepted a recommendation after a four-day hearing by an administrative hearing panel made up of a student, faculty member and staff representative. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> announced the sanctions just 10 days after a strongly worded grand jury interim report urged university officials to crack down on <LOCATION> Pi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> fraternity, where the woman was allegedly raped March 5 by two fraternity members. The grand jury report issued last month said the 18-year-old victim was raped by more than one person and left in a life-threatening condition of intoxication. She suffered several scratches and abrasions and had crude words and a fraternity symbol scrawled on her thighs. Other fraternity members allegedly tried to block the university's investigation, which led to the arrest of three men. `` The question of not cooperating was a pretty serious one,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. The fraternity's president, <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belleair </LOCATION>, denied claims that the fraternity failed to cooperate. `` I know that we cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> police from the beginning and we'll continue to,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. The fraternity, which has about 170 members, has until May 15 to appeal the sanctions. Fraternity members <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> were charged with sexual battery. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON>, 19, of Plantation, a Pi Kappa Alpha member at <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was charged with being an accessory to a felony and failing to report a sexual battery. <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> were freed on $ 10,000 bond last week, while <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON> was freed on $ 6,000 bond.

 The ailing mother of deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> today slipped into semi-consciousness after asking President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow her son to return as `` my dying wish.'' There was no reaction from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the request of 95-year-old <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who was hospitalized Sunday with pneumonia and diabetes. The military chief hinted the armed forces command opposed a Marcos return. Dr. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' condition had worsened in the past 24 hours.

She is semi-comatose.'' Later, <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON> told radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZXL </ORGANIZATION> that Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' condition was `` very, very bad and the prognosis is very poor at the moment.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> stayed behind in February 1986 when a military-civilian uprising drove her son to exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and brought President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come back. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s staff said the presidential palace received a letter today from Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> asking that her son be allowed to return to be with her in her final hours. `` My end beckons me,'' said the letter, the text of which was released by the presidential palace. `` I know I am about to render my own accounting with my maker. I leave our world content. `` My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon my lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my bedside, as I say goodbye to all of you who have been part of my mundane existence. `` May God bless you with all the compassion, understanding and the undying love of a mother to her own child, especially at the sunset hours my being. Pray grant me this wish ... as one mother to another for the love of all.'' Presidential officials said the letter was signed with Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' thumbprint and was written Monday. They said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had not been shown the letter. Only family members and attendants were allowed in Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' hospital room. But dozens of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters jammed an adjacent room where they watched Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> through a small window. Outside the hospital, about 100 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters held a candle-light vigil and prayed for her recovery. Earlier, <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON> said the patient was not responding to medication because of her advanced age. He said the former president's brother, Dr. <PERSON> Pacifico </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, and his sister, Mrs. <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barba </PERSON>, were at their mother's bedside. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> said the former president was aware of his mother's condition. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come back, saying his return would not be good for the country. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to several previous coup attempts. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keon </PERSON>, who died in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in December 1986. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> today said that if Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> died, the Cabinet would be consulted on whether to allow the former president to attend the funeral. `` We will have to assess at this point in time whether conditions in the past are still the same,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> told reporters. `` We still have certainly a serious threat situation in the country, coming from -LRB- communist rebels -RRB- and we do n't want additional problems if it's possible at this time.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> came from a prosperous northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> family of Filipino and Chinese extraction. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' father <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON>, a politician and lawyer, died in 1944 during the Japanese occupation.

 Israeli security forces raided a Palestinian newspaper and detained the managing editor, police and newspaper officials said today. <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the Arab - and English-language Al Fajr newspaper in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, sharply criticized the Monday night raid It followed the closing Monday of the Palestinian weekly, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>, and was the latest in a series of measures taken against journalists. `` I feel all these oppressive measures will backlash against the peace process,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today. `` Journalists apparently are being singled out for special attention.'' A police official confirmed that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities carried out the raid, and security sources said managing editor <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> would be jailed for six months without trial under Israeli emergency regulations. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Since unrest began in the occupied territories Dec. 8, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities have shut two pro-Palestinian newspapers and a press agency, arrested 22 reporters, most of them Arabs, and lifted the credentials of two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> correspondents. The authorities said they closed <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>, the only English-language weekly magazine published in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> because it received funding from terrorist organizations. The magazine's publisher, <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kara'een </PERSON>, denied the charge. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> said it was not clear why <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON>'s managing editor was detained. `` We are making inquiries with our lawyers today about what actions to take,'' <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> said. The army also has periodically closed large areas of the occupied territories to journalists and empowered local commanders to chase them from the scene of trouble spots. Israeli officials have blamed television cameras for stoking the fires of the uprising and accused the press of maintaining a double standard, taking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to task for actions that are overlooked elsewhere in the world. `` A sort of paranoia has developed about the media,'' said <PERSON> Yariv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Eliezer </PERSON>, a professor of film and communications at <ORGANIZATION> Tel-Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Soldiers always ask, ` Why is the media against us?' and students ask the same question.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, acknowledged Israelis feel resentment toward the media. The media `` have given us the short end of the stick _ they did n't tell the whole of the Israeli side of the story,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. `` No wonder there is resentment.'' He stressed, however, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has made no changes in its policy of freedom of the press. `` We scrupulously maintain our principle of safeguarding the freedom of the press in the country,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. `` There are very few countries in the world that would allow this kind of freedom, in the situation we have been in during the last months.'' Monday's actions followed the six-month closure in March of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdah </PERSON>'s sister organization, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a key source of information on the occupied territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also shut down a left-wing, pro-Arab Israeli newspaper, <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON>. The Press Service and <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON> were charged with maintaining links with terror organizations. Since its February closing, four editors of the Israeli newspaper, including three Israelis, have been arrested and accused of membership in guerrilla groups. At least 18 Palestinian journalists are in jail, many held under administrative detention orders which allow imprisonment for up to six months without trial, according to a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has also periodically barred the distribution of Arabic-language newspapers in the occupied territories. Last month, the government suspended the press credentials of foreign correspondents <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> after they published details of the assassination of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader without submitting them to military censorship. Since the uprising began, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 200 foreign journalists working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has received between 100 and 150 complaints of harassment and physical attacks by Israeli troops and Jewish settlers, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, the group's chairman. `` There is a feeling among many people that the media should be taken out of the territories, that if you do n't see it, it is n't there,'' <PERSON> Ben-Eliezer </PERSON> said

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran's family held a tearful reunion with his 20-year-old daughter, separated from them for 16 years by red tape. `` She's home,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Hanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dung </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> International Airport Monday night. `` A few times I had a lot of wonders and a lot of worries, but you do n't give up on something like this.'' `` I never gave up hope,'' his wife, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, said as she waited for her daughter's plane to arrive. `` Every night I prayed and prayed.'' Ms. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s prayers were answered at 6:35 p.m. Trembling and smiling nervously, she entered the plane to greet her daughter and her husband. Ms. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dung </PERSON> emerged from the aircraft with tears in their eyes. Ms. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, her arms draped around her daughter, guided her to her 18-year-old sister, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, and her 15-year-old brother, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> was 2 when the family left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dung </PERSON> had never seen her brother. There were more tears than words. <PERSON> Hanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dung </PERSON>, clad in red corduroy pants, white and purple sneakers and a gray jacket over a white shirt, said nothing as she faced dozens of reporters and television cameras. She speaks little English and had been awake for more than 24 hours, her father said. `` She's glad to be here. She's tired and she's worn out,'' said the 49-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant. `` She's got some adjusting to do.'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1972, leaving <PERSON> Hanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dung </PERSON> behind with her grandmother, who has since died. Two years later, they tried to arrange for their daughter to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but progress was slow. In 1975, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fell to the communists. <PERSON> Hanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dung </PERSON> has held an exit visa from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since 1979, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not allow her to emigrate because some medical test results had been lost. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Puyallup </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, traveled to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in February to try to bring his daughter back. After <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s return to this country in April, his daughter was finally allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Following final arragements, she flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where she met her father. The two continued to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Asked Monday night what kept him going through the long fight to bring his daughter home, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> replied simply, `` Love.'' He said his battle to get his daughter back left him bitter, and vowed to continue the fight to help reunite other Amerasian families. `` I do n't know what my next move is,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` But there's going to be a next move.''

<HEAD>Letter To Pravda Criticizes Communist Party, Past and Present</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member harshly criticized his comrades in a letter to Pravda, saying their careerist ambitions and conformity made the party into a mere instrument of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his successors. The letter from a government official, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON>, to the party daily differed markedly from the usual criticism now seen of the Soviet past, which blames former party leaders themselves for excesses or departures from Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON>, deputy chief of administration at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the 19-million member party itself, and its role in his country's political life since the death of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> in 1924. <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON>, a party member since 1972, wrote: `` The party is the mind, honor and conscience of our epoch.'' Those words of V.I. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> unfortunately can not be applied to all members of our party at the current time.'' His letter, frontpaged in Pravda's Monday editions, appeared the day after May Day, the workers holiday, and its prominent place was clearly designed to give its contents maximum exposure. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has told party members to back his ambitious program for `` perestroika,'' or social and economic restructuring, or get out of the way for those who do. He is expected to use a party conference on June 28 to set his stamp even more firmly on the party, which holds the monopoly on Soviet political power. `` The main question of perestroika is the democratization of society, and this is not feasible without democratization of the party,'' <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON> wrote in this letter. To that end, he called for reviewing each <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION>'s past performance to see whether membership should be extended or revoked. The nation's criminal code, now being rewritten, should be modified so Communists who commit crimes get a more severe sentence than non-party members, he said. Party leaders up to the level of regional chief should be elected for a set term by secret ballot, he said. Top local party officials are now appointed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and the appointment ratified by a ritual vote. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself floated the idea of a more democratic selection process for local party officials at the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting in January 1987. The idea was not repeated in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s report, indicating a defeat for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but it has resurfaced in speeches by Soviet officials. Analyzing the often troubled role of the party during 70 years of Soviet history, <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON> wrote that during the internecine ideological battles of the late 1920s and 1930s, the party leadership pursued unity `` at any price.'' The result, he said, was the spread of the opinion `` that the GenSec -LRB- party General Secretary -RRB- is always right, that his speeches are the truth, down to the last detail ... it is only necessary to correctly quote the leader.'' During their tenures as party leader, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> all had no intention of modifying the party structures that concentrated so much power in their hands, <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON> wrote. For many Communists and their families, the careers, awards, benefits and contacts with influential people they could obtain from their party membership became the chief goals in their lives, he said. In the 1970s, when <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was in power, <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON> said some people told him that having intelligence and a conscience was incompatible with being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts met with <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials today to start a search for the remains of two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen shot down in a wartime reconnaissance mission 22 years ago, a military spokesman said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team of 14 people arrived in southern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> on two C-130 transport planes from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The planes carried electric generators, metal detectors and tools to excavate the site in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province where the Mohawk OV-1A aircraft crashed, said Maj. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON>. The weeklong project is the third U.S.-Laotian excavation for the remains of 555 Americans listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the team included an anthropologist experienced in identifying human remains and two weapons disposal experts in case any live munitions remained at the site. The team is from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, Honolulu-based agencies entrusted with resolving the fates of Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War. The war ended in 1975 with the defeat of the U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, the Resolution Center commander, will be working with officials from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' Defense and Foreign ministries, <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province is in the southern panhandle area between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The crash site is 95 miles east of the city of <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said the remains of 11 missing Americans were recovered in the first joint excavation in the communist country in 1985 and eight others in a 1986 project. On previous excavations, the workers went down on their hands and knees to dig out plane wreckage and sift for bone fragments with fine metal screens. A number of unexploded shells were found. At <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION>, the Americans hope to resolve the fates of two soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire struck the Mohawk March 15, 1966. <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft on that mission reported that one crewman parachuted out but landed in the area where the plane crashed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts said they saw no trace of remains during a preliminary inspection of the site last week. Serial numbers found on some wreckage were confirmed by the aircraft manufacturer, the <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as belonging to an OV-1A Mohawk. Details of the Mohawk's mission were not available. But a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes were shot down in eastern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> while trying to disrupt traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which North Vietnamese communists used to bring men and supplies into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> agreed in August 1987 to devote more effort to the MIA issue after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged to respond to its calls for humanitarian assistance.

They were announced on Friday in a brief British statement after <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> conferred in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> told a news conference on Friday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> supported the `` political dynamism'' behind the talks.

The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the talks will cover both the troop withdrawals and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. But the exclusion of Namibian and Angolan rebels appeared to indicate the emphasis will be on getting the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> and Cubans out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, rather than Namibian independence. Previous attempts at settlement have foundered partly on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's demand that Cuban troops leave before <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> becomes independent. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> repeated that demand in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on Monday. In recent months, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> and Cubans have been bogged down in heavy fighting around the strategic southeastern city of Cuito Cuanavale. The war is a heavy burden on the already strapped Angolan economy, and the Cubans have sustained high, but undisclosed, losses. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> acknowledges that more than 50 of its troops have been killed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since September.

 A man who was the biggest single-game winner on the TV game show `` Super Password'' has been sentenced to five years in prison for an insurance scheme in which he falsely said his wife was dead. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> on Monday also ordered <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> to repay $ 100,000 to an insurance company and said prosecutors were correct in calling <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> a `` con man and a thief.'' <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON>, 36, who had been living in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, admitted fraudulently collecting the $ 100,000 from an insurance policy by saying his wife had been killed in an auto accident. <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, who had not been living with her husband, told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents she was unaware he had collected on the policy, held by <ORGANIZATION> Amex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> admitted obtaining a death certificate and accident report from a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and filling them out to fake his wife's death. Investigators later found Mrs. <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> on active duty at <LOCATION> Lackland </LOCATION> AFB in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where she had been transferred. <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> pleaded guilty March 14 to two counts of a six-count mail-fraud indictment returned by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> had used the name <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> to appear on the TV show, which was seen by an Alaskan banker who recognized <PERSON> Ketchem </PERSON> as the man who allegedly ran up about $ 25,000 in credit in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by fraudulently obtaining credit cards.

 <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> bided his time for nearly a year, waiting for the immigration service to reveal that its amnesty program was just a cruel trick. But, facing the deadline, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> took his place in line to sign up. The Mexican-born <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> and thousands of others jammed lines outside and inside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> offices nationwide Monday as the clock ticked toward Wednesday's midnight deadline for applying for amnesty and the right to become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen By Monday, 1.2 million people had signed up under the program in the western region, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> western regional commissioner. Two million were expected to sign up nationwide, he said. When asked on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show why so many aliens had waited until the last minute, <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said, `` Same reason that you did n't file your income tax until, like me, four o'clock on the fifteenth of April. Procastination is the biggest problem that we all face. And the illegal alien is no different.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, applicants lined up two days in advance to be assured help Monday morning. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, they brought lawn chairs, ice chests and toys for the long wait. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, aliens conceded they had been putting it off, but now there was no time left for procrastination. `` I was afraid before, but now there's no more time to be scared,'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said, as he stood outside the <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, ready to apply for himself, his wife and two daughters. `` A good friend says it's not a trick, and now I realize I have to think of my family.'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 39, a janitor who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978 from <LOCATION> Aguas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calientes </LOCATION>, said he easily assembled the papers needed to prove his family had lived here since Jan. 1, 1982, as required by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. One of the authors of the legislation was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday, and he sought to reassure those hoping for a life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Wednesday night at 12 o'clock we will take anyone in the line, all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., who donned an ornate sombrero `` -LRB- They -RRB- will receive status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that removes them from a fearful subculture of human beings.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, aliens began lining up as much as two days in advance in front of the <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> office, agency spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said. `` We had 600 people out there this morning,'' <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said Monday. `` It was n't healthy. We have no restroom facilities on the weekend, we have traffic problems, and and it's a danger to people.'' Thousands of undocumented aliens queued up Monday outside the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> INS office. At least 2,000 camped out Sunday night. One woman stood holding her baby in one arm and in the other, clutching amnesty documents that were longer than the infant. `` This is an incredible amount of activity,'' regional <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. `` The pace is really phenomenal, particularly in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.'' `` Things have been so wild,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Botts </PERSON>, chief legalization officer for <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where the number of applications had doubled during the past month, numbering 500 to 600 Monday. Some, like <PERSON> Beto </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 26, who stood in line outside a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office, said they had procrastinated because it took them a long time to assemble the paperwork needed to prove continuous residency. `` I want to work,'' he said. `` If I did n't have to work, I would n't have gone through all of this.'' <PERSON> Edilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>, a friend waiting with <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, said, `` He just wants to know how it feels to be an American citizen.'' With the amnesty program about to end, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to shift its emphasis to sanctions for employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. `` Amnesty is not going to stem the flow -LRB- of illegal aliens -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said. `` Sanctions are going to stem the flow.''

<HEAD>Talks To Set Rules For Mining In Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives from 37 nations have opened a monthlong meeting aimed at hammering out international rules governing the mining of oil, gas and other minerals in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. The talks were opened Monday by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Environmentalists, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> organization, are strongly opposed to any mining in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and say the mineral-rich continent could one day ignite a military conflict as the world's natural resources dwindle. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, which conducts scientitic research in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, is campaigning to have the continent a `` world park.'' But to others, in particular the 19 countries operating geological programs there, <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is rich in mineral resources waiting to be extracted. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is represented at the meeting, estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleum reserves and vast quantities of coal, copper, gold and uranium in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> told representatives from the 37 <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> nations there was no reference to mining in a 1959 <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> and the meeting would fill that gap. In 1977, the nations agreed to voluntary mineral restraints. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeby </PERSON>, deputy secretary of foreign affairs, said it had not been determined whether mining should ever be allowed <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>.

 A top aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> wrote an eight-line poem that spoke of `` ill winds that taunt us'' shortly before jumping out a window in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel room to his death, The Sun reported today. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, administrative assistant to the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrat, died Sunday after talking with colleagues about a front-page article that appeared in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The story said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, 46, recruited young, single men as employees and pressured them to socialize with him. The Sun today quoted an unidentified source close to the police investigation as saying <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' poem read, in part, `` Ill winds that taunt us through peace and understanding will not cause us to have a crash-landing.'' The verse also spoke of the `` dark and ugly world.'' `` Goodbye'' was neatly printed on the lined notebook paper that bore no addressee, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. Police called the death a suicide. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders considered asking a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional candidate to step aside so a stronger opponent could challenge <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>. The Post article quoted former <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> aides as saying the congressman had ceded control of his office to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. Some staff members complained about <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' unusual demands, including one that an unidentified employee perform a striptease at a staff retreat. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Skipper </PERSON>, another aide, were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to meet with a lawyer and attend the Broadway musical `` Phantom of the Opera,'' police there said. Republican leaders said Monday they are thinking of asking <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>, a political novice who won the party's nomination in the March primary, to consider stepping aside so a better-known candidate can challenge <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>. But they said they wo n't try to force <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON> out, and <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON> said he would not withdraw. `` I was given the ` 10 count' the day after the primary,'' he said. `` I think I'm more electable than anybody has imagined.'' <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>, a former high school social studies teacher who has never held public office, works as a counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. His campaign has no paid staffers and he estimates he so far has raised only about $ 1,000. Democratic officials Monday predicted <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, 39, would win re-election in November.

 A judge said he was sending `` a warning to landlords'' when he sentenced a Russian emigre violinist to 15 years to life in prison for hiring arsonists to burn an occupied apartment house he owned. The landlord, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>, 39, who has performed at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, insisted at his sentencing Monday that he was innocent. `` The truth did not come out at trial. People lied under oath,'' <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> protested when state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> sentenced him. <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, asked the judge for leniency and said his client had been frustrated and financially hobbled by the complexities of the city's housing laws. <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>, who came to this country 10 years ago, is a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>, married and the father of a 2-year-old daughter, was unable to make an adequate living at his profession, according to <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, so he became a landlord. He owns four buildings. Atlas, who heard <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>'s two-month trial without a jury, told the defendant that he convicted him only after finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge also said he could not believe <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>'s assertion that virtually every prosecution witness had lied. The judge said the sentence, imposed under a recently enacted `` arson-for-profit'' law, should be `` a warning to landlords that their financial problems will not be solved by burning down their buildings.'' Atlas convicted <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> on Oct. 6 of first-degree arson, second-degree conspiracy and first-degree reckless endangerment for torching his five-story building in the Chelsea section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Feb. 24, 1986 while a rent strike was on. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Flamm </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> wanted to burn the 15 tenants out so he could collect $ 250,000 in insurance money and then rent to tenants who would not be covered by rent control or rent stabilization laws. <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> hired four men to torch the building, but two were seriously burned when the 40 gallons of gasoline they had brought into the building ignited. The four pleaded guilty to third-degree arson and are awaiting sentencing. The building's occupants escaped the blaze without injuries and moved back into their apartment after repairs were made. Ms. <PERSON> Flamm </PERSON>, observing that the value of <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>'s building increased after he bought it, said, `` He could have made a handsome profit without arson but profit was not enough.'' <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> blamed the tenants for his troubles. `` The tenants did not pay for two years,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, being a landlord you can never win.''

<HEAD>Investigators Find More Weakened Rivets In Aloha's Boeing 737 Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAHULUI, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two fuselage panels on an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that ripped open at 24,000 feet had several rivets showing signs of cracking, but officials are not sure if the cracks were present before the accident. More electronic tests of rivets along a key strip of the plane's structure were scheduled for today as investigators near the end of their field work, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday A 20-foot section of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737's upper fuselage ripped off as it flew across the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Thursday, killing a flight attendant and injuring 61 of the 89 passengers. Tests were done on 760 rivets and 30 were found cracked, he said. None of the bad rivets were next to each other and they were randomly scattered along the length of the aircraft, he said. In normal maintenance, rivets usually are checked visually for cracks resulting from metal fatigue, and a focus of the investigation will be whether that method is adequate, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. The pilot of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s Flight 243, Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, and co-pilot <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, returned to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Monday to look at the crippled plane they managed to land. `` They had not seen the floor beams and were just as amazed as the rest of us. Our investigators have been scratching their heads that the aircraft held itself together,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said he hopes the accident forces the airline industry to reassess its maintenance methods and take another look at `` high cycle'' aircraft, meaning older, heavily used planes. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the oldest versions of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s not to fly above 23,000 feet. Meanwhile, family members, friends and hundreds of fellow workers at <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> gathered in a hangar at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Monday for a memorial service for missing flight attendant, Clarabelle `` C.B.'' <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, 57, who was swept out of the plane when it tore open.

 The government refused to allow three rightist elected officials to go today to the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, where Melanesian separatists are holding 23 police officers hostage in a cave. The main pro-independence organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, also rejected the offer. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ukeiwe </PERSON>, who represents the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island territory in the French <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said he and two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenou </PERSON>, want to change places with the hostages. <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> asked that an airplane be made available for the three men to go to <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>. The request was refused. `` Given the present situation and the talks in progress, the government has decided to not accept this proposition,'' said a official in the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Transportation to <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Loyalty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> group east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s main island, has been interrupted since separatists attacked a police station in the village of <LOCATION> Fayaoue </LOCATION> on April 22, killing four policemen and taking others hostage. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, a French possession since 1853, is about 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and has been the scene of sporadic violence since 1984. About 43 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s 145,000 people are native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, and many of them favor independence. About 36 percent are Europeans, who generally want to remain part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The rest are mostly Asian or Polynesian. Ukeiwe, <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and Nenou are members of the rightist Rally for the Republic, and are prominent opponents of the separatist movement. The hostages include the head of an anti-terrorism squad and an assistant prosecutor. The hostages are being held in a cave in a remote part of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, which lies off the east coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s main island, La Grande Terre.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could limit terms of office of high-ranking officials and develop a two-party system in the near future, a panel of Soviet officials said during a conference on U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. American participants at Monday's conference appeared skeptical upon hearing those and other statements from their Russian counterparts, who outlined plans to revitalize Soviet society after what they called `` 10 years of stagnation.'' `` We are only in the beginning of the process,'' said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shislin </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s only political party. `` In five, seven, 10 years _ I do n't know'' how many parties there might be, he said. `` I'd like to see more evidence,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessinger </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Goodwill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He said he'd like to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to see such changes for himself `` If half of what they say is true, there's an amazing thing going on,'' said <PERSON> Kessinger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Plekhanov </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Candada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said a greater separation of power is part of the goal. `` We are talking about introducing the rule of law in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But do we want to turn into a litigious society? `` We want ... the judiciary empowered to pass judgment on laws and a legislature with more independence,'' <PERSON> Plekhanov </PERSON> said. `` But do we want to create a class of professional politicians?'' The panel discussion was one of many events at the annual weeklong conference here, which is now in its 28th year. It brings together experts on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet affairs. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will hold a party conference and will consider many new laws to promote change and create what <PERSON> Shislin </PERSON> called a state of citizens' rights. One issue will be rules to `` promote rotation in the party,'' he said, including limiting the general secretariat to two or three 5-year terms. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kislov </PERSON>, a political scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said such a system is necessary `` because we have to get rid of the people who are afraid of change.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> knew a November 1986 series of concerts at Radio City Music Hall would probably be his last, but still his longtime manager said the late entertainer never told him he had AIDS. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s personal manager for 37 years, said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> complained to him the night before he closed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` He said, `` ` I've been working 43 years and I'm very tired. I may never work again and I want to quit on top,''' said <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, but he said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> did n't say why. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said the performances were indeed <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s last. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>'s testimony came Monday as a hearing on a request by the late entertainer's longtime manager and four others to remove <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate and head of his trusts entered its third week in state court. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said the next month he asked <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> if he had AIDS and <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> denied it, ordering his attorney to sue a newspaper that reported he had the fatal disease. `` He said, ` No, I do n't have AIDS, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>,' `` <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> recalled. `` I'd been with him all those years and I had no idea he had AIDS.'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> told him to call his attorney, Strote, and launch a lawsuit against the Las Vegas Sun. `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> wanted the Sun sued, but it never went anywhere,'' he said. `` That's what broke the story about AIDS.'' <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died less than two months later, on Feb. 4, 1987, at his <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home from complications of AIDS. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who was the executor on all of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s wills except the final one penned by Strote two weeks before <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s death, had harsh words for <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, who also served as <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>'s attorney. `` After <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> died and he became executor, he turned on me like a snake,'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Strote </LOCATION>. `` We were very close friends before that.'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, who he introduced to <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1970s, of ordering he be kept from <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> in the final weeks of the entertainer's life. He said he was n't allowed to see <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> hospital two weeks before he died. `` Mr. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had put out an edict against me,'' said <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who first served as <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s manager in 1950. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> described how he traveled with <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> and described their friendship and business relationship as very close. `` We had a wonderful performer-personal manager relationship,'' he said. `` We never had any fights over business.'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said he made some $ 500,000 a year over the last years of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s life from his contracts with the pianist. The last year of his life, he said was a `` slow year'' and he made $ 450,000. `` I deserved it and I'm not ashamed of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> also said he had life insurance contracts on <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> that paid $ 300,000 upon his death. He said that was normal in the personal management business.

 A six-week audit shows dozens of calls were made to a dial-a-porn service from a state-owned telephone in a prison warden's home, according to a report published today. `` This is the first I've ever heard of it,'' Gander Hill Prison Warden <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told The -LRB- <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> -RRB- Morning News on Monday. `` I do n't know who would do it, other than my oldest son or my daughter.

The number of calls showed `` surprisingly'' little abuse of state telephone lines, <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said Monday. The survey turned up $ 75.33 in direct tolls for calls to special service lines, although the report did not detail costs charged for calls on the state's wide-area, bulk-calling service. `` I reached the conclusion that, from a financial standpoint, it's not a significant problem,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` Although it does raise questions about what the individual employees involved have to do with their time.''

 Solidarity chief <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today told thousands of cheering workers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard that they must find another union leader as a strike took hold at the birthplace of the outlawed labor federation. Strike leaders said 80 percent of the 12,000 workers had dropped their tools. The yard's giant cranes were idle, and a large poster at the gate listed the strikers' demands: higher pay, reinstatement of Solidarity nationwide, release of political prisoners and reinstatement of fired activists. Thousands of workers, gathered in the factory's courtyard and perched on rooftops and fences, heard <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s speech. `` We do n't want to be the beggars of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and of the world,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the shipyard workers as he endorsed the strike that began Monday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who headed the August 1980 strike at the shipyard that gave rise to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent labor movement, received a loud cheer from the workers when he entered the yard this morning. The 44-year-old electrician had been on sick leave this week, complaining of back pains and low blood sugar. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told workers that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s labor struggle had exhausted him. `` I am not your leader. I am tired ... You have to find for yourself a new <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>,'' he said. He also told the workers they were taking up the same cause he fought for in 1980. `` We lost eight years,'' he said, speaking through a loudspeaker. `` Here, in the birthplace of Solidarity, I state to the authorities that they are deepening the losses, they are forcing Solidarity to lead the nation onto the road to reforms,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize. The work stoppage at the shipyard was at least the fourth strike in communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in a week and contributed to the worst wave of labor unrest since the government's December 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity. In Wroclaw today, workers at a railroad car plant stopped production for about an hour. And a bitter strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steelworks in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> entered its eighth day. About 1,000 workers laid down their tools for several hours at the <ORGANIZATION> Pafawag </ORGANIZATION> railroad car plant in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, said Solidarity spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON>, but they resumed work after a promise for talks with management. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> confirmed the stoppage. <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>, 62, a 36-year veteran of the shipyard who led a strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> shipyard when martial law was imposed in December 1981, has emerged as the leader of the strike committee. `` The nation has to believe somebody. It will believe only Solidarity,'' <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> said in a speech today at the shipyard gate. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> `` supports us,'' <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> told the strikers. `` We listen to him and follow his advice.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> endorsed the strike when it began Monday. But he stayed off the local strike committee to coordinate Solidarity activities nationwide, activists said. Strikers slept outside in the shipyard overnight and police detachments roamed the city, but were not near the shipyard gate. When the strike began Monday, police surrounded the shipyard, and authorities reportedly rounded up regional Solidarity leaders. Nevertheless, Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said management had agreed to talk today to the shipyard's newly formed strike committee. A spokesman for the shipyard was unavailable today and a secretary said shipyard director <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolwinski </PERSON> was in a meeting. The news of the strike heartened the steelworkers in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We feel better now,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciesielski </PERSON>, a member of the steel strike committee at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steel works in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. A Solidarity communique signed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and issued late Monday said, `` A strike wave is covering the country. They are not just local conflicts. They are across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> because the cause is the economic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies that would offer prospects for the future.'' Workers want pay raises of up to 60 percent because prices have risen about 40 percent this year due to reductions in government subsidies. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said police arrested nine regional representatives on the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Solidarity </LOCATION> leader, was detained, said Solidarity's chaplain, the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s latest labor trouble began April 25 with a wildcat action by transit workers in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>. It was settled the same day with pay raises of at least 50 percent. Thousands of workers at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> heavy machinery plant struck Friday and ended the action Saturday after promises of higher pay. About half the 3,500 workers at the Dolmel electronics plant in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, stopped work Monday. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader, said the job action ended when management promised a raise.

<TEXT>
 Entering his third month as postmaster general, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> today shook up the management of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with a series of personnel shifts. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> named two associate postmasters general, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, to supervise technology and operations, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to handle international affairs. In addition, consumer advocate <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s department was expanded to include supervision of measuring the performance of the mail service, and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> was placed in charge of administrative services. He was promoted from marketing and communications. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who had been known as an innovative manager in the banking business before taking over the postal job, also announced that he was shifting the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s planning operations to report directly to him and separating them from the finance operation. Also at today's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s board of governors, it was announced that the agency had rejected a recommendation for lower postage on preprinted return envelopes. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had recommended cutting prices for items such as utility bills that are mailed back to post office boxes. The governors concluded, however, that most of the savings in such a case is achieved by the use of a post office box rather than the preprinted envelope and they felt it would be unfair to offer lower postage to some letters going to post office boxes but not to all. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced that it had suffered a loss of $ 635 million for the accounting period from Dec. 19 to March 11. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had anticipated a lost of $ 586 million for that period. Higher postage rates intended to put the service back in the black took effect April 3.

<TEXT>
 Ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON> today said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership can not afford to disappoint the nation in the application of its reform campaign. `` This hope must not be deceived, or then it will not be easy to restore faith to the people, to elevate them to great tasks,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Stroitelnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Construction Newspaper -RRB- in an interview. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, once considered a protege of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, was fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief Nov. 11 after criticizing the slow pace of reform and the party's style of leadership at a party meeting. One week after his ouster, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was named first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a government job that carries the rank of minister but that is clearly inferior to the post of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss. <PERSON> Stoitelnaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazeta </PERSON> sought <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s comments in connection with a front-page article on woes in the Soviet contruction industry, which is having to conform to the same cost-cutting and efficiency measures as the rest of the economy. `` The situation here is serious in effect,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. `` Thus cardinal changes in our branch are especially needed.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and social reform program, known as `` perestroika,'' or reconstruction, had reached a `` decisive phase.'' Its success, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> added, depends on `` the support of the wide masses of workers who hope for changes for the better in their lives and link them with perestroika.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who graduated as a construction engineer in 1955 from the <ORGANIZATION> Ural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, said the reform program could bring quick, beneficial changes in construction. `` What is reconstruction in a position to give people in the near future? I think, first of all, an improvement in housing conditions, growth in the number of up-to-date medical installations, schools and kindergartens,'' <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON> said. Housing is an acute problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where one family in five lives in dormitories or communal dwellings. A party program has called for the construction of enough new housing so each family will have its own home or apartment by the year 2000. Although the article printed in <LOCATION> Stoitelnaya </LOCATION> Gazeta made no reference to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s stormy political career, he defended the criticisms he had made at the October meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published abroad last month. `` I spoke in a straightforward manner and said what I felt and thought was correct,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. `` Someone said correctly: each must think independently so that later not all suddenly see the light at once.'' That interview was published in the inaugural edition of a German-language version of the state-run weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which was printed and distributed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s comments were not reproduced in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News' Russian editions.

<TEXT>
 The pilot and co-pilot of a race balloon that floated perilously for hours above a jagged island in the Gulf of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> landed safely today and were declared the race's winners, officials said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were declared the unofficial winners of the annual <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> Balloon Race after they touched down at 3:43 a.m. on Angel de la Guarda island, said race spokeswoman <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodbeck </PERSON>. Their balloon had floated about 365 miles southeast from its starting point in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Brodbeck </PERSON> said. The pair had declared an emergency shortly after 1 a.m. and called for assistance when their helium balloon began descending over the rough, uninhabited island, Ms. <PERSON> Brodbeck </PERSON> said. `` They ran out of ballast to throw overboard and began dropping about 100 feet a minute,'' she said. `` That's a lot.'' Ballast is made of weights used to control the altitude of such balloons. When the helium in the craft cools, it contracts and loses its lift, said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Soukup </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Balloon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` To counteract the sinking, you have to throw ballast, in this case sand and water, overboard,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs plane spotted the balloon at about 3 a.m. and stayed nearby in case of a crash landing. Upon touchdown, the jet dropped supplies including a raft, food and water, the spokeswoman said. The couple were believed to have landed near the beach, but that was unconfirmed, Ms. <PERSON> Brodbeck </PERSON> said. The official winners will be announced Saturday night during a `` Survivor's Banquet'' and will receive a trophy designed by <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> editorial cartoonist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, she said. The other six balloons in the race, which left here between 11 p.m. Sunday and 2 a.m. Monday, all landed by Monday afternoon. The winning crew is the one whose balloon lands farthest from the start of the race. Restaurateur <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> holds the record for the race, which is named after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> newspaper publisher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who founded the event in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1906. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> flew 1,346 miles to <LOCATION> Millarton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, in 1981. Fickle winds held last year's winner to just 49 miles. Of the other entrants this year, distances ranged from 247 miles down to 42.

 A couple has won $ 7.5 million in a malpractice suit against a psychiatrist whose patient killed their 23-year-old daughter. <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON>, was fatally stabbed July 17, 1978, by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, who was later found innocent of a murder charge by reason of insanity. Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merin </PERSON> had treated <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> during the three years before the killing when he was medical director of a private psychiatric hospital. <PERSON> Merin </PERSON> called the verdict `` shocking and regrettable'' because he said he believed he had done `` everything I humanly could do with the resources available to me to make sure <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> did not kill <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON>.'' His lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, said he may appeal. <PERSON> Merin </PERSON> said a number of psychiatric hospitals had treated and discharged <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> between the time he was diagnosed as psychotic in 1973 and the slaying. According to testimony, <PERSON> Merin </PERSON> warned Ms. <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON> in a letter in August 1976 that <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> had talked of harming her. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> had dated her for about one year before his breakdown. He believed he was a messiah and that he had to kill Ms. <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON> to save the Jewish people, according to testimony. He continuously tried to contact her between 1973 and 1978, but she did not return his telephone calls and tried to avoid him, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, the Rotmans' lawyer. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Merin </PERSON> should have hospitalized <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> while he had psychotic delusions about Ms. <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON> and that his letter of warning should have been stronger and more explicit. Ms. <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON> was stabbed when she arrived at a Quincy nursing home where she worked. The Rotmans were awarded $ 4.5 million by a <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. Interest payments will add $ 3 million to the award. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> has been a patient at <ORGANIZATION> Bridgewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> since the slaying.

 Israeli tanks pushed to within a few miles of Syrian troops today, reinforcing heavily armed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers as they searched for Palestinian guerrillas in the rugged hills of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Syrian forces went on full alert. Helicopters flew in about 500 Israeli troops to the northern edge of <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> before dawn, Lebanese police said. The troops then fanned out around the area and began their search. Several hours later six Israeli tanks and nine armored personnel carriers rolled into the village, police said. `` It seems the Israelis are reinforcing their positions,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations. He said the Syrian command ordered its estimated 16,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> north of the village on `` maximum alert'' shortly after the Israeli operation started. In <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops distributed leaflets calling on residents not to cooperate with Palestinian guerrillas. The village of about 3,500 people has been a stronghold for the guerrillas and their <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> allies. Before the helicopter landing, Israeli artillery shelled areas around <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> and several nearby villages. There were no reports of casualties. The operation occurred north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> created the zone in 1985 after it withdrew most of its forces, which had occupied <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1982. The police spokesman said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops had not clashed with the Syrians. `` But the Syrians have their tanks dug in on hills overlooking the Israeli operational zone,'' the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> indicated his government was not seeking a confrontation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think there is such a danger ...,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today. He described the operation as part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ongoing policy of conducting sweeps in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and added: `` It is a usual action of watching and securing the area from attacks of terrorists.'' The operation began Monday night. The Israeli army censor held up initial reports for hours. Acting Lebanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> instructed its ambassador at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to lodge a complaint against the Israeli action. `` This new aggression by the -LRB- Israeli -RRB- occupation forces violates the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. An Israeli commander in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, not identified by name, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he instructed his soldiers that the operation was a complicated one. `` Do n't be speedy in pressing the trigger ... but if you do shoot you mean it seriously and shoot in order to kill.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, head of northern command, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the operation sought to `` deliver a message to residents of the villages outside the security zone that we would not agree to an increase of hostile activity against the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The operation was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Feb. 17, 1986, when more than 1,000 troops and dozens of tanks pushed into south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to search for two soldiers captured by Lebanese guerrillas. During that operation, Israeli troops detained more than 100 suspected guerrillas and questioned 3,000 Lebanese civilians. Two Israeli soldiers and eight Lebanese were killed. The missing Israelis were not found. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said it appeared 1,500 to 2,000 Israeli troops were involved in the current operation. Israeli sources said fewer than 1,000 soldiers were taking part. Two guerrilla infiltrations into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last week brought to 12 the number that have taken place since Nov. 25, when a Palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider near an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> military base and killed six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers before being shot to death. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say the increase in cross-border raids is linked to the five-month Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said soldiers had rolled into three villages in armored personnel carriers and a few tanks, ordered residents out of their homes, then searched village houses. The Israeli newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> quoted an army spokesman as saying bulldozers were brought in to wreck houses of collaborators. Another Lebanese police spokesman said reports from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Arkoub region in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> indicated <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops seized at least three suspected guerrillas An Israeli army spokeswoman, who can not be identified according to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law, said searches by the armored column were being concentrated in the Lebanese villages of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chouba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chebaa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebbariye </LOCATION>, all within three miles of the Israeli border and inside the 6-to-10-mile wide security zone. The area was once known as `` Fatahland'' because <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> faction, controlled it before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978. The Israelis withdrew about three months later. They invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> again in 1982.

<HEAD>Trust Fund Suggested to Finance Future Flights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> space committee proposed today that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and industry explore setting up a trust fund to finance future American ventures in space. Such a fund, said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would work like the highway trust fund that financed the interstate highway system. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> also said that the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget authorization bill, which a subcommittee will take up Wednesday, will for the first time include a multiyear authorization. `` It stands to reason that any good and reasonable plan must have a duration of longer than a year,'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION> at its annual meeting in nearby <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` We insisted on the absurdity of funding our plans in one-year cycles.'' He said that had worked against rational planning because `` you can not devise a long-term research and development program, hold a tactical team together, and keep your facilities and equipment up to date if your primary concern is what next year's budget is going to be.'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said the subcommittee will authorize spending for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal 1989 through fiscal 1991. He said there was a great need for innovative space financing methods. `` How about developing a national space trust fund?'' he asked. `` We have built and maintained our country's highway system ... through the highway trust fund.'' He said that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which will probably get $ 10.5 billion to $ 11 billion for the next fiscal year, needs at least $ 3 billion more. He said a national space development bond program could raise the money. `` Would the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> buy bonds for their space program?'' he asked. `` I'm sure they will if somebody asks them.'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said he may hold hearings to explore public and industry reaction to his suggestion.

<TEXT>
 Reds Manager <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> called his 30-day banishment from baseball for shoving an umpire `` excessive,'' and says he'll fight the longest suspension handed a manager in 41 years. National League President <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> ordered the suspension Monday, two days after the incident he called `` one of the worst in baseball's recent memory.'' During the ninth inning of Saturday night's game, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> rushed from the dugout to argue a delayed call by first base umpire <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> that allowed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> to score the winning run in the 6-5 game. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said he pushed <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> twice after the umpire poked him in the cheek. The game was delayed 15 minutes and <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> was forced to leave after fans at <LOCATION> Riverfront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> showered the field with debris. The game was completed with three umpires. Coach <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> managed the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> to a 3-2 victory over <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said he was `` shocked'' by the length of the suspension and would challenge it. `` While I expected to be suspended, I feel that this unprecedented 30 days is excessive,'' he said. Rose will ask <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> to reconsider and will be allowed to manage the team pending the outcome of the appeal. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s decision would be final The suspension was the longest for a manager since <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Durocher </PERSON> of the then-Brooklyn <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> was suspended the entire 1947 season for allegedly associating with gamblers. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> also said he had summoned two <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> broadcasters, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennaman </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuxhall </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for `` inciting the unacceptable behavior of some of the fans'' by criticizing <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> for the call.

Considered a certain victor in the nation's capital but given little chance in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as the first votes were being cast and then plunged ahead on the campaign trail, heading for appearances in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Early turnout estimates varied. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> there were reports of heavier than normal turnout in black precincts. `` They are out for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellick </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Mahoning </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> board of elections. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received two-thirds of the vote in the 1984 presidential primary, the turnout was described as moderate. Turnout was light in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where both <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic officials said interest had been affected by the lack of close races. `` It takes the excitement out of it,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, press secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his claim to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination secure, was hammering away at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as inexperienced on foreign policy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shot back with a swipe at Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for failing to provide sufficient funding for day care. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was also being criticized by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a `` Teflon'' candidate not being forced by the media to spell out the cost of his proposals. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held to his refusal to respond directly to gibes from his Democratic rival. `` I'm not just a talker, I'm a doer,'' he said, repeating a line he has used for months in response to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attacks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was expected to capture at least 200 of the 254 delegates at stake in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. That harvest would place him fewer than 600 delegates shy of the 2,081 needed for the nomination, and about that many ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> offered the day's biggest prize with 159 Democratic and 88 Republican delegates. At stake in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> were 79 Democratic and 30 Republican, while the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> offered 16 Democratic and 14 Republican. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surpassed the 1,139 delegates needed for a GOP convention majority last week in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and was celebrating his victory at an `` Over the Top'' rally in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel tonight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would formally endorse the vice president `` in the next couple of weeks.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stayed neutral while there was still a contest for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Asked if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> represented a pattern for the coming months, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said, `` That's not the thrust of his campaign. But he's not going to shy away from talking about that kind of thing either. ... You are going to see him running an aggressive campaign.'' Campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded sharply to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism of administration policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and his charge that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> was paying Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> $ 200,000 a year. `` I ca n't wait for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` And I'd say, ` What would you do about it?' It's fine sitting out there You see, you can make a lot of unfounded criticism. But what's his suggestion? What's he going to do, and do it in a way that handles the delicate Central American relationships that we're building? `` We're moving towards democracy. Ninety percent are now living under democracy in this hemisphere. We do n't want to set that back by some kind of macho statement out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and spent part of his day visiting a day care center at an inner-city high school as part of an attempt to court more black support. He also told reporters he had no intention of criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose black supporters will be essential to any Democrat's chance of success in the fall. But he had no such hesitancy toward the Republicans. `` We want an attorney general that you and I can be proud of, not ashamed of,'' he said, in a reference to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. He also said that in his administration, `` There wo n't be any <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Borks </PERSON> nominated to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' He added, `` We ca n't have two and a half million people without a home in this country and young families who ca n't afford a home,'' he said. `` That's not the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in a luncheon speech to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, called for a substantial increase in the minimum wage and for a corporate code of conduct to press companies benefiting from federal help to invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and not take jobs outside the country. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would raise the minimum wage of $ 3.35 an hour to half the average hourly wage of production workers, which is $ 9.19. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s staff said he gradually would increase the wage standard to $ 5.50 an hour by 1993. The Democratic candidate also complained he was being held to a different standard by the media than was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` So far the media is allowing him to have <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, a reference to a situation in which opponents' criticism slides right off. `` In time, that will change,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The media challenged me to show how I would pay for my dreams. I have done just that.''

 The third convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in five days headed up the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tried to make up for time lost to a mine threat and fighting with Iranian forces. The convoy got under way as Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in the gulf to inspect <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> operations and confer with Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less, commander of the Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and other senior officers. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> was expected to meet with top officials of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments in the gulf to outline the latest change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy that will permit <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warships to respond to requests for help from non-U.S. flag vessels under attack by the Iranians. Shipping industry and government officials in general have reacted favorably to the change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` rules of engagement.'' These had previously restricted commanders to protecting only American-flagged ships and giving only `` humanitarian aid'' to others if requested. The latest convoy was confirmed by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman hours after shipping executives reported it sailing through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> into the gulf for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. It included the 294,739-ton <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> 81,283-ton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, both oil products tankers, escorted by the destroyer USS Merrill and the guided missile frigate USS John H. Sides. The convoy was the 28th this year and the 50th since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed last summer to reflag and escort 11 Kuwait-owned tankers to protect them from Iranian attack. The tankers' scheduled movement had been disrupted after the missile frigate, USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, was severely damaged by a mine in the central gulf April 14. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated four days later by destroying two Iranian oil platforms and sinking or disabling six armed vessels in day-long fighting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of laying mines, including the one that nearly sank the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and wounded 10 crewmen. The convoys resumed after American and European minesweepers found and destroyed several more mines in international shipping lanes. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied there was any postponement, six of the 11 tankers were backed up in the convoy staging area in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, outside the gulf. Three of those, the Gas Queen, <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Surf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, reached <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Friday, the first convoy to make the 550-mile trip up the gulf since the U.S.-Iran clashes. The Merrill and the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON> escorted a second convoy out of the gulf Monday. It comprised one Kuwaiti tanker, the 46,723-ton gas carrier Gas King, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Navy-chartered freighter Rover and the Golden Monarch, a privately owned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanker. The <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was making its first return trip to the gulf since it was knocked out of service last Oct. 16 by an Iranian missile. The tanker was waiting to load at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s main terminal when a Chinese-made Silkworm missile hit the bridge and crew's quarters, severely wounding the American captain and 17 others. The <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> left the gulf March 11 after nearly five months in a repair yard.

 The federal arts agency today recommended that high schools require students to complete two years of arts instruction to help keep <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children from growing up `` culturally illiterate.'' A report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> on the state of arts education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> set a national goal of making the arts an integral part of the school curriculum from kindergarten through the 12th grade. `` The problem is, basic arts education does not exist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today,'' said the endowment, an independent federal agency which underwrites a wide variety of artistic projects with a budget of $ 167 million. `` The arts are in triple jeopardy,'' the endowment said in a report requested by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. `` They are not viewed as serious, knowledge itself is not viewed as a prime educational objective, and those who determine school curricula do not agree on what arts education is.'' The endowment prescribed a series of steps, including stiffer curriculum requirements, teacher training, testing and evaluation, to provide all students _ not just the gifted and talented _ with a thorough education in their artistic heritage. `` Without knowledge and understanding of such supreme achievements, we are culturally illiterate,'' the report said. Endowment chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> said he will lead a series of regional meetings with state and local arts and education officials around the country to `` make a case for the study of the arts.'' The first, starting next Monday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, will include officials from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> acknowledged at a news conference that his emphasis on arts education `` will be a problem in some school districts'' that favor equipping students to compete in science and technology. But he reminded questioners that the arts are part of the basic school curriculum in high-tech <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Study of the arts, he said, `` helps us to be masters, not servants, of technology.'' The endowment suggested doubling Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s proposal last December for one year of art and music history as graduation requirements under his model high school curriculum. Instead, the endowment proposed requiring two years of art courses, or other approved courses that incorporate the arts, to obtain a high school diploma, and said high schools might consider extending the class day to seven periods to accommodate the new requirements. High schools also should offer optional courses in each of the arts, such as dance, theater or films, for talented students who wish to pursue their interests beyond the required courses, the report said. Currently, the endowment said, high school graduation requirements in 29 states include some form of the arts, but 13 of those states allow such courses as homemaking or industrial arts as substitutes and only nine require arts courses specifically. The endowment said junior high schools _ grades 6 through 8 _ should require all students to take arts instruction for at least 15 percent of the school year, with specific emphasis on the often-neglected areas of design and media arts such as television and movies. For elementary schools, it recommended a `` fairly minimal'' guideline of 4 -LCB- hours of arts instruction in a 30-hour school week. The endowment urged the states to stiffen their credentials requirements for arts teachers, and consider using qualified professional artists to help fill the ranks where there are shortages of arts teachers. Noting that only 6 percent of school districts require competency tests in the arts for promoting pupils to the next grade, the endowment said that until testing and evaluation of arts instruction is improved, `` arts courses will continue to be considered extra-curricular and unimportant.'' The report concluded that `` the artistic heritage that is ours, and the opportunities to contribute significantly to its evolution, is being lost to our young people.'' It cited a survey conducted three years ago which found that 61 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults had not attended a live cultural performance or visited an art gallery or museum in the previous year. `` The cultural heritage and most contemporary expression outside the popular culture of the moment is not part of the lives of most Americans,'' the endowment said, but added: `` There is evidence that arts education can make a difference.''

 The final episode of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> detective show `` Magnum P.I.'' smashed the competition in the national ratings for its special two-hour time slot on Sunday, network officials said today. Super sleuth <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnum </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, captured a 32 percent national rating and 48 percent share of television viewers during the 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT period, according to spokesmen at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and CBS. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s initial installment of the two-part drama `` The Richest Man in the World _ The Story of <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, came in a distant second, garnering a 12.1 percent rating and 18 percent share. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' with <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, trailed the group with a 9.2 percent rating and 14 percent share. Magnum ended its eight-year, 162-episode run with a two-hour special called `` Resolutions,'' in which the crime-fighting Hawaiian detective rejoins the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and discovers his half-Vietnamese daughter is alive. Loose ends were also tied up for Magnum cohorts T.C. -LRB- <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> -RRB- who was reunited with his ex-wife and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manetti </PERSON> -RRB-, who in the final scene is about to marry a former prostitute.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A guerrilla-imposed road transport ban, the third this year, drastically curtailed traffic nationwide today. Not a single city bus was seen circulating downtown in a rush-hour tour of the capital <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Buses are by far the most important mode of public transport in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Circulation of privately owned cars was a fraction of that on a normal day. Thousands of workers left home early and walked, often several miles, to their jobs. Many owners of vans and pickups converted them to public transports, charging 40 cents, about six times the average bus fare. Virtually all of the pickups and vans were overcrowded. During the previous transport ban in March, the overcrowding caused several accidents that killed at least one person and injured several others. Leftist guerrillas waging an 8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government called the indefinite ban in response to what they say is an increase in repression by police and the armed forces. No time limit was put on the measure, although previous bans have lasted two or three days. The guerrillas enforce the ban by firing on or burning buses, trucks and private cars. On their clandestine Radio Venceremos, they warn drivers that guerrillas and their supporters will be taking down license plate numbers and that retaliation could come at any time in the future. Dispatchers at the capital's two main intercity bus terminals said no buses had arrived from or left for provincial cities. Gen. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, said Monday night that all leaves for members of the 56,000-strong armed forces had been canceled to provide security along the nation's roads and highways In previous strikes, the army has put its trucks into service as public transport. A few were seen on city streets this morning, but not as many as in previous bans.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Primary Victims of Prisoners' Postal Money Order Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARCHMAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Men who answered ads in homosexual magazines were the primary victims of a $ 330,000 postal money order scam run by seven current and former <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> state penitentiary inmates, officials said. The inmates and four other people, including several relatives of the prisoners, have been charged by the federal government in the scam. The April 22 indictments resulted from a probe by <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> postal inspectors that began in 1986. The scheme, officials said, involved the changing of 800 U.S. Postal money orders between September 1986 and last month. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> inmates using similar scams have cleared $ 5 million over the past six years, officials estimate, and the schemes have spread to other state prisons in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. There have been 35 convictions connected with the scams. According to the recent indictments, inmates wrote to those who had either placed or responded to personal advertisements in magazines. Inmates used fake names and claimed to be in prison on minor charges, such as drunken driving. Two inmates would then call the individuals who responded and pose as the inmate's case worker, social worker or lawyer. Eventually, victims were asked to cash money orders from the `` case worker'' and send the money to a third party. The non-inmates involved in the scheme would buy money orders for between $ 1 and $ 5, then deliver them to the inmates, who would alter the value to amounts up to $ 700. The people who received the money orders never knew they had been altered, officials said. They would cash them for the altered amounts and mail the money; the non-inmates involved would then forward it to the inmates. Of more than 25 victims caught in the scheme by inmates, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> postal inspector <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Argubright </PERSON> said, `` the majority of victims were from homosexual-oriented magazines.'' For the last three years, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> has stamped all prisoners' letters with the warning that recipients should not cash any money orders enclosed, state corrections department <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. However, prisoners circumvent this precaution by sending letters to co-conspirators outside prison, who mail them in other envelopes.

 A man convicted for a second time in the 1973 murders of six members of a family faced a possible death sentence as the sentencing phase of his trial began today. A <ORGANIZATION> Dekalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury on Monday found <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> guilty in the slayings of <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>'s sons <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The sentencing phase of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s trial opened today with testimony by police officials who investigated a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> slaying allegedly committed by <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and his co-defendants. Defense attorneys said they plan to call <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s mother and sister to testify about mitigating circumstances in his early life. The slayings took place May 14, 1973; <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s original conviction was overturned on appeal. When the verdict was announced, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, standing with his hands in his pockets, shifted his weight from one leg to another, but otherwise showed no reaction. Prosecuting attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> has said he will seek the death penalty. West expressed disappointment at the verdict, but said there was a good chance <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 41, could receive a life sentence because the jury took about 3 -LCB- hours to reach a verdict. `` They're taking this very carefully. One of the jurors was crying ... the jury seems to be sympathetic to <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, his half-brother <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> and a third man, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON>, were convicted and sentenced to death in 1974 for the slayings. The victims had interrupted a burglary at <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>'s trailer in the southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Donalsonville </LOCATION>. The five <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> men were shot to death one by one at the trailer and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> was killed in a nearby field after being raped repeatedly, according to testimony. A federal appeals court ordered new trials in 1985, ruling that excessive publicity made it impossible for the three to get fair trials in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, site of the murders and first trial. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was convicted of murder and again sentenced to death at his retrial in <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> in January. <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> is to be tried later this year in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> did not testify at his trial. Psychologist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was a `` depressed, passive individual, with few leadership capabilities'' and would suffer a severe anxiety attack if called to testify. In closing arguments, <PERSON> West </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> as a passive, dimwitted accomplice of clever murderers. He also attacked the testimony of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>' brother, who turned state's evidence in the original trial and testified against <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> last week <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was 15 at the time of the killings and received a 40-year sentence. Defense attorneys called <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> to the stand Monday, but he refused to testify.

 Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has accepted an apology from an aide accused of making slurs against Jews and Christians, but the mayor later said the apology might not be sufficient. `` In this administration, with this mayor, we will not tolerate any individual who has views of this type,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said Monday night at a reception given by a Jewish group. `` We are reviewing the situation, and we will have something to say about it in the near future,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> added.

In the lectures, taped and later sold at the Nation's bookstore, <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>, who is black, variously contended that Jews are conspiring to gain world control and that the crucifix is a symbol of white supremacy. `` I humbly apologize to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> residents of all races and religious groups who were offended by remarks made prior to my ascension to the mayor's office,'' <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>, 35, said Monday in a signed apology. At the time of the lectures, <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON> was an aide to then-alderman <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who became mayor after the Nov. 25 death of Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. `` I have, since working in the mayor's office, respected all those I have had the privilege to serve,'' said <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>, who makes $ 35,000 a year. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said Monday night that <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>'s apology `` might not be sufficient.'' He made that comment at a downtown reception for 300 people celebrating the 40th anniversary of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> had answered questions about <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON> earlier in the day by saying: `` I do n't think it's necessary to fire him. He's got a wife and family. He needs the income, so I've asked him to tone down his rhetoric.'' A telephone call to <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON> at his City Hall office Monday was not returned. A guest at Monday night's reception, State Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said an apology is not enough. `` It was n't an accidental speech made in the heat of the moment,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>'s ouster, and <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisendrath </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would take up the matter next week if the mayor fails to act. <PERSON> Eisendrath </PERSON> said he had drafted a resolution asking that <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON> be fired if <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has not already done so by the next regularly scheduled <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting, on May 11. `` I'm shocked that he has n't already been told to pack his bags,'' <PERSON> Eisendrath </PERSON> said. Groups denouncing <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>'s remarks and demanding that he be removed included the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renewal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an urban mission agency; and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultation </ORGANIZATION>, which describes itself as the Midwest's oldest coalition of white, black, Hispanic and Asian groups.

 Doctors at a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> hospital today surgically separated 17-month-old twin girls joined at the head since birth. A 40-person medical team began the operation on <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> early today and completed the surgery 7 -LCB- hours later. <ORGANIZATION> Baragwanath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported late this afternoon that both girls survived the operation and described it as `` successful.'' No other details were available immediately. About four hours into the surgery, hospital officials described the black girls as stable and said doctors were `` very happy with progress so far.'' Last September, doctors at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> separated West German twins joined at the head. The boys, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, survived and were released in March, but they reportedly are suffering physical and mental problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Baragwanath </ORGANIZATION> medical team, headed by Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipschitz </PERSON>, performed two operations on the black girls last October to prepare for today's surgery. The girls share a major blood vessel in their heads, which doctors partially clamped in the earlier operations in hopes lesser blood vessels would take over the functions of the shared vein. `` This is going to be a long, lengthy, intricate operation which carries many dangers with it,'' <PERSON> Lipschitz </PERSON> said last week of today's surgery `` The prognosis is still very grave.'' <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, the girls' mother, attended a prayer service at the hospital chapel this morning. About 100 people, mostly nurses and patients, said prayers and sang hymns for the girls. Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, a 33-year-old domestic worker who earns about $ 60 a month, gave birth to the twins Dec. 7, 1986. She said initially she was so horrified that she refused to see the girls for three days. `` Once persuaded to see them, I immediately accepted and loved my little gifts from God,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> said. The girls have a combined weight of 33 pounds. <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> appears to be developing normally and recently began to speak, while <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced, said officials at <LOCATION> Baragwanath </LOCATION>, the main hospital in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> was asked to make a $ 5 contribution for her daughters' care, which is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The costs are being covered by the hospital and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> medical school. The Sowetan, a daily newspaper, has set up a trust fund for the twins that has raised $ 26,000.

<HEAD>State Officials Say Bookmark Lottery Ticket Was Foregery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A computer expert who worked for a company that helps operate the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> state lottery printed a fake ticket so that he and a friend could share a $ 15.2 million jackpot, state officials said today. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> used a computer at his firm, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to print a copy of the winning ticket, then gave it to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>, state Attorney General <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said at a news conference today. The ticket listed the winning numbers for the Super 7 lottery drawing last July 15. One winning ticket to that jackpot was sold statewide, but the winner had never claimed the prize. When he came forward last week <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> claimed he had kept the ticket in a cigar box, then used it as a bookmark until recent stories about the unclaimed prize led him to double-check the numbers. <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> cashed the ticket last Thursday and received a $ 469,989 check for the first installment. State officials quickly detected the attempted fraud, however, and the money was never paid, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, a computer expert at <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>, which works with the state lottery, has been charged with theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, conspiracy, forgery, tampering with public information and unlawful use of a computer, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. Rich is being held in <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> was in custody this morning and would be charged later in the day. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON>, executive director of the lottery, said the forgery was traced because <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>'s ticket was printed on paper that was returned to the state by a lottery-ticket agent in <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, while computer records showed the unclaimed winning ticket was actually sold in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> admitted that some lottery officials had doubts about the validity of the ticket, but he said he decided to award the prize anyway because the computer validation code on the bogus ticket was accurate. By 4:30 p.m. Thursday, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said lottery officials knew the ticket was fake and stopped payment on the check, which <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> had deposited in several accounts at a local bank. Agents from <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>'s office confronted <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> on Sunday. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> told the agents <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> was expecting $ 5,000 from him Monday. On Monday night, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> $ 5,000 provided by the state. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, who was armed, tried to flee when agents moved in, but he was captured without incident, the prosecutor said. This is the second fixing case to plague the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Lottery. The April 24, 1980 drawing of the Daily Number was fixed by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits. The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, also resulted in tighter security procedures for the televised drawings. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said new procedures would also be implemented because of the new case.

<HEAD>Woman's Touch Knocks Out Electrical Appliances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> says her body is so full of electricity that she knocks out ordinary household appliances with a mere touch. She says she is one of about 40 people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who are similarly afflicted, and the experts are baffled. The Sun newspaper, which interviewed the 46-year-old housewife, calculated that she has wrecked 25 household irons, 18 toasters, 15 kettles, 6 tumble dryers, 10 washing machines, 12 television receivers, 12 radios, 3 videos and at least 250 lightbulbs. The total damage, the Sun calculated, is about $ 13,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> says she does n't bother to count anymore. `` I do n't touch the video or the microwave,'' she said in a telephone interview Tuesday from her home in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. `` I cook only with gas.'' She said she lost her job at the counter of a drycleaning store `` because I was making the tills go haywire.'' She said she once knocked out her bank's computer by leaning on a terminal. Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said she has suffered from body electricity since childhood, but it worsened in 1982. `` It's not a party trick, something I do at will. It comes suddenly, by itself. You can get quite a sharp shock shaking my hand.'' Doctors who have examined her think it may be caused by an allergy or stress, `` but I'm not a tense person. I'm a noisy, sense-of-humor kind of person,'' she said. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a bus-driver's wife with three children, said the only solution she has come up with is to shower three times a day. `` It washes the electricity off the skin,'' she said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> began a search Tuesday for remains of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers shot down 22 years ago on a reconnaissance mission in a remote area of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said. A 14-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team flew from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on two C-130 transport planes to meet a group of Laotian officials at the crash site in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province of southern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, said Maj. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The two aircraft carried electric generators, metal detectors and tools to excavate the site where the Mohawk OV-1A airplane crashed. The joint search is the third in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to account for about 2,400 Americans who did not return from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. The wars in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> ended in 1975 with victories of communist forces, but some Americans lost in the early 1960s were listed as missing in action. A preliminary ground search involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts last week failed to locate any human remains at the site in southern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The American team, which includes an expert in identifying human remains and two explosive disposal specialists, will live in tents during the week-long search, <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said. The team is from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. The Honolulu-based agencies are working to resolve the fates of Amerians missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lists 555 MIAs in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, mostly pilots who went down on missions over the <ORGANIZATION> Ho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION>, the vital communist supply line which funneled men and material from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said the Laotian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams hope to discover the fates of two soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire struck their airplane on March 15, 1966. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft on the same mission reported that one crewman parachuted out but landed near where the plane crashed, 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 25 miles west of the main section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Serial numbers found on wreckage last week were confirmed by the aircraft manufacturer, the <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as belonging to an OV-1A Mohawk. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said famlies of the two crewmen have been notified, but the names of the MIAs have not been publicly released. The remains of 11 Americans were recovered in the first joint excavation in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in 1985 and eight other sets of remains were found in 1986. On previous excavations, the workers went down on hands and knees, using small shovels and other hand tools to dig out plane wreckage and fine metal screens to sift for bone fragments. A number of unexploded shells were found, prompting the addition of explosives experts to the new team. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts say chances of uncovering remains grow smaller with the passage of time in the harsh tropical climate. They say looting by local people also takes a toll.

 A skeptical eighth-grader analyzed her school lunches for nutritional value and says the meals did not make the grade. Thirteen-year-old <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> has been carrying her own lunch to school for some time, taking salads, fruits, vegetables, an occasional sandwich, and `` is big on raisins,'' her mother, <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, said today. `` I was always skeptical of school lunches,'' said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> student who won state recognition for her experiments. `` They tell you they are nutritional, and I suppose they are from the standpoint of the basic food groups, but it seemed to me that there was an awful lot of fried food and salt. If everything is fried, then the food group balance does n't matter that much,'' Miss <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> recently froze five school lunches and extracted or calculated their fats, proteins, sodium, cholesterol and carbohydrates using equipment at the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of here.

State officials said students would n't eat more nutritious fare when it was offered and often threw the food in the trash. `` If the schools are to change, we'll have also have to change the likes and dislikes coming into the cafeteria,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, assistant superintendant and director of child nutrition programs for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` The days of liver and spinach are past,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said.

 Two police officers of this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb have accepted suspensions for failing to act promptly in the rape ordeal last year of a 12-year-old girl. On Dec. 20, police waited for nearly 30 minutes outside an apartment before rescuing the girl from a rapist despite repeated pleas from the victim's mother to break down the door. <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Police and <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted 2-1 Monday night to find Officers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Surufka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> guilty of violating department rules. The commission voted to drop three other misconduct charges against each man. Lawyers for the officers had presented the negotiated settlement to the three-member board. <PERSON> Surufka </PERSON>, 27, will be suspended without pay for 21 days, while <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, 38, will be suspended for 15 days without pay. `` I would n't exactly say I'm bitter. I'd just say I'm a little disappointed in the system I work for,'' <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> said. But City Prosecutor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> called the officers' punishment `` appropriate. The agreement came three weeks after the commission found Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, the senior officer outside the apartment, guilty of five misconduct charges and voted 2-1 to fire him. Rather than kick down the doors of the apartment, <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> waited for the landlord to arrive with a key. He testified at his hearing that he feared the rapist might kill the girl if he heard police breaking in. A fourth officer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, did enter the apartment through an unlocked back door, however, and rescued the girl as she was being raped. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> is appealing his dismissal in the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 A woman who says she had an affair with <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> has denied that she got her county job because of the relationship. The Better Government Association, a private watchdog group, has demanded that <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, board president for 19 years and <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, resign for giving county government jobs or preferential job treatment to women who agreed to sexual trysts. But <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 35, said Monday she apologized to <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> for bringing the affair to the association's attention. `` If anyone should resign from a job, it is me,'' said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, a police officer with the Forest Preserve District. She said she got her job `` not through sex but through proper channels.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BGA </ORGANIZATION> contends that <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, a 75-year-old widower, engaged in sex with four women between 1980 _ the year his wife died _ and 1986. <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> has said he is guilty of nothing more than `` extremely poor judgment'' and `` having relationships with the opposite sex, which hurt no one.'' Leading Democrats have rallied behind the veteran politician and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> gave him a hero's welcome Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Rock were among office-holders saying <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> should remain at the helm of the county's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organization. But not all of his colleagues agreed the matter should be dropped. `` When you have such allegations, I think its the duty of the state's attorney and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney to investigate,'' said county board member <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebel </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that landed outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with only one engine operating had run out of fuel for the other three, aviation sources in and out of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said today. The sources, who asked not to be identified, said that the tanks supplying fuel to the three dead engines were found to be dry when the plane landed. The fourth tank had about 20,000 pounds of fuel remaining and was in no imminent danger of also going day. It was not known whether the fuel problem had been caused by a pilot error or by a mechanical problem with the plane's fuel-switching equipment On a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, fuel is routinely transferred from tank to tank during a long flight to balance the aircraft. One source said it is possible that a fuel line or filter could have kept the fuel from being shifted properly or the flight crew by mistake might have shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank and not been able to shift it back in time. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet has a variety of gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been burned and how much is left. The flight engineer in the three-person cockpit normally performs his own calculations as to fuel burn and availability as well. `` Either one of two things happened. Either the crew messed up or the transfer pumps or valves or lines were not working properly,'' said the source. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds and burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel per hour while cruising with all four engines operating, according to the manufacturer. The plane, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight 97 from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with 239 passengers and 19 crew members aboard, first lost the use of one engine at 39,000 feet over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about 75 minutes from the airport. A second engine failed about 30 minutes later. Pilot <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> radioed the control tower at 2:49 p.m. that he had shut down two of the four engines due to malfunctions and asked permission to land. A third engine failed shortly before landing. The plane touched down safely at the airport in <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported the fuel starvation problem in today's editions. A <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, said that during the flight, the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and that the No. 3 engine was malfunctioning.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's new policy of extending naval protection to neutral ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> has been formally implemented, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today. Under the new policy announced last Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf may come to the aid of any neutral, friendly commercial ship not serving ports in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> if the ship comes under attack in international waters. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said last Friday the new policy would be implemented `` once we have informed those free world, non-belligerent countries that maintain shipping interests in the gulf.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said `` the appropriate people have been notified'' and the new policy was now `` in effect.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the policy applied equally to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> when it came to breaking up attacks on merchant ships. `` If it meets the criteria ... then the rules are the same for whoever the attacker might be,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The spokesman noted, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not expect any confrontations with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces because that country has limited its attacks to ships steaming inside certain declared exclusion or war zones. `` The pattern is pretty clear,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` The exceptions, the attacks have been for the most part by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> outside the exclusion zone. `` We are prepared, under certain circumstances, to offer assistance to ... non-belligerent vessels serving neutral ports that are attacked by anyone outside the exclusion zones.''

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jews said today a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> rabbi had been chosen to head their community on an interim basis, but the rabbi said he had yet to receive an invitation and did n't know whether he would go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also denied that such an arrangement had been made. However, Rabbi <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>, contacted in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he would be willing to consider a short-term arrangement. `` I have not yet received an official invitation to come to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and if I do I would have to think about it,'' said <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>, 71. `` I might accept something shorter in term ... My life is here in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. I imagine with some understanding we could come to some kind of agreement.'' At issue is a successor for Rabbi <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, who is leaving <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after an eight-month tenure marked by several disputes with the city's Jewish community president. Sources within the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jewish community told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON> had received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> naming <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON> as interim successor for <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON> has confirmed that <LOCATION> Lorge </LOCATION> is going to be the new rabbi. But he will be a rabbi on an interim basis, until a permanent rabbi can be found,'' sources close to the Jewish community president said. They said Jewish leaders have in mind a rabbi in his 30s as a permanent successor, but declined to elaborate. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBow </PERSON>, director of community services for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, denied that such an arrangement had been made with <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>. `` There is no truth to the report that he is coming,'' <PERSON> DuBow </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON> had been a guest rabbi in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during the High Holidays in the past. <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to flee Nazi persecution in 1936, said he wanted to help <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community. `` I have a philosophy that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> should not get a posthumous victory _ that there should not be any country where Jews are not able to have any kind of community,'' he said. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> complained last weekend of interference from leadership of the local Jewish community and outlined differences with the communist government over funding. He said he would leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on May 16 and might return in September, but not to work. Jewish leaders, in a statement to the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, denied they meddled in <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>'s activities. `` The assertion that Rabbi <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> was hindered in carrying out his functions by members, or the community representatives, or other people must be rejected with emphasis,'' the statement said. It said <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> told community members last month that he was returning to his <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, home for medical reasons. `` His current assertion that anti-Semitic tendencies in the press of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- have caused his return were never raised in his discussions with the community,'' the statement added. In explaining why he was leaving in an interview at his <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home last weekend, <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, 65, talked of differences with the East German press over coverage of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and attitudes toward Jewish issues. The East German Jewish community has fewer than 350 officially registered members and about 100 others. Last September, <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> became the first rabbi assigned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 21 years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> upheld bans on homosexual activity by clergy and others, but left the way open for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s second-largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination to gain more knowledge on the subject. Some leaders said the approval Monday at the denomination's governing convention of a four-year study on homosexuality had left the reaffirmed bans in question `` It's a tacit recognition that there is some legitimacy to various points of view,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> for Social Action. The church's nine-member Judicial Conference, a church court, must rule by Wednesday whether the study can be funded under a rule that bars funding of any homosexual group or promoting acceptance of homosexuality. Delegates overwhelmingly approved that action, along with continuation of the bans on active homosexuals in the clergy and condemnations of such activity generally, then authorized the study. United Methodists, often called `` those singing Methodists,'' today began consideration of a new, 625-song hymn book that contains 330 new numbers, including spirituals and gospel songs. The hymnal, however, also retains a heavy sprinkling of numbers by the Methodists' hymn-writing founder, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>. Friction over homosexuality has continued for two decades in the 9.6 million-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, largest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Protestantism after Southern Baptists, and has troubled other denominations. `` Homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling to conscientious Christians of differing opinion,'' the Methodists declared in authorizing the study of the origins and nature of the practice, biologically, psychologically and sociologically. Delegates voted 676 to 293 to maintain the restriction on ordained clergy, and even more strongly _ 765 to 181 _ for the expanded blanket rejection of homosexual practice. The restrictions expressed uncertainty about homosexuality, and during a nearly four-hour debate, some delegates charged they were based on shaky ground. `` We admit we lack understanding of homosexuality, and yet we are willing to condemn those who _ some say by <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s choice _ are homosexual and who are living a homosexual lifestyle,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maplewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Timberlake </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said there were hundreds of petitions urging the restrictions, and that not upholding the bans `` would break faith with our constituency.'' Others said not keeping the bans would drive thousands out of the church. During a break in the debate, about 150 members of a homosexual caucus called Affirmation gathered around the podium. `` We are a gentle, angry people, and we are singing, singing for our lives,'' they sang. Although the reaffirmed restrictions were tempered to some extent, Affirmation leaders denounced them. `` It's a terrible thing that the church wants to cut itself off from a whole class of people by calling them second-class citizens,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, an avowed homosexual minister from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, called the votes distressing. `` I remain convinced that the longer we put off really facing up to this issue the deeper and deeper the polarization in our church will become,'' <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> said. While it is widely recognized that countless clergy and others during Christian history have been homosexuals, most churches reject homosexual activity, particularly among the clergy. However, in many cases, dealing with the matter is left to regional units or dioceses. In issuing its marginally modified blanket position in the Book of Discipline on Monday, the denomination declared: `` Although we do not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with Christian teaching, we affirm that God's grace is available to all.'' The latter phrase was added to previous phraseology, along with other appended portions emphasizing the church's care and ministry to all persons. New material also acknowledged `` our limited understanding'' of the complexities of sex and said the church should take the lead in exploring `` this most complex issue.'' Delegates also set a theme for the church's next four years of `` Celebrate and Witness'' to <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, in connection with a stress on evangelism to stem a gradual shrinkage in membership. The conference also authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to seek to raise a $ 100 million fund for scholarships for needy students.

 Help Wanted. Thirty-five thousand openings. Must be detail-oriented. Pays $ 5.50-an-hour, plus mileage. Outdoor work, no heavy lifting. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> is gearing up for the 1990 national head count, and it needs people to help compile the address list for use in mailing out the forms when the time comes.

Most of the work is in counties away from metropolitan areas. Lists of the 56 million addresses in large cities are being purchased from commercial mailing-list companies. Those compiling the address lists will work for about six weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said, with the effort starting in July in 18 states. The compilation will continue through December, moving to other states as the first ones are completed. Applicants must take a written exam.

The address list will be used to send census forms to households in the spring of 1990, and then to double check which ones have been returned and which require follow-up visits. At that time an even bigger hiring effort is planned, because some 400,000 temporary workers will be needed for the census itself.

 Passengers aboard <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 97 today recalled the drama that unfolded before the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jetliner landed safely at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> with only one of its four engines working. `` When the sound of the engine stopped suddenly, I thought my heart beat would stop, too,'' said <PERSON> Shinobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Murota </PERSON>, 21, who was sitting in a window seat close to plane's right engines when the jetliner landed Monday. `` I could feel the plane lose the power and start floating in the air like a hang glider. I thought we are going to crash,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leu </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 97 from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with 239 passengers and 19 crew members aboard lost the use of one engine while at 39,000 feet over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about one hour and 15 minutes from the airport, and a second engine about 30 minutes later. Pilot <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> radioed the control tower at 2:49 p.m. that he had shut down two of the four engines due to malfunctions and requested an `` expedited approach'' with emergency vehicles standing by, said <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The jet lost the use of its third engine shortly before landing, Leu said. But with 16 emergency vehicles including fire engines and ambulances lining the runnway, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-100 landed safely at the airport in <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 3:17 p.m.. A statement released by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said three engines lost power But it did not specify whether they were shut down by the pilot or lost power by themselves. The statement said the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was investigating. Government and industry sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said today that the tanks supplying fuel to the three dead engines were found to be dry when the plane landed. The fourth tank had about 20,000 pounds of fuel remaining and was in no imminent danger of also going dry. It was not known whether the fuel problem had been caused by a pilot error or by a mechanical problem with the plane's fuel-switching equipment On a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, fuel is routinely transferred from tank to tank during a long flight to balance the aircraft.

On landing, the passengers cheered and applauded when the jetliner touched down. The aircraft taxied to the terminal under its own power, and all aboard left the plane in a normal fashion. No one was injured, Leu said. Ms. <PERSON> Murota </PERSON>, who was returning from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said she was extremely frightened when flight attendants told passengers to put their heads down and grab their ankles in preparation for an emergeny landing. `` But when I saw the runway nearing, I knew I could at least survive because we are not flying over the ocean,'' she said. `` The impact of landing was harder than usual,'' she added. `` It went ` bang! bang!' twice at landing, and I felt my heart beat quickly. Then there was a big cheer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Kazuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, who was returning from her honeymoon, as saying: `` I expected death at any moment.''

<HEAD>Mass Recall of Missouri Bullfrog Ordered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A mass recall of pet <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bullfrogs is under way, prompted by fears that when they mature they may gobble up the gentler denizens of British garden ponds. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman says he can already imagine the movie version _ `` The Bullfrogs That Ate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barratt </PERSON>, who owns a garden supply center in <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, says about 200 of the 400 tadpoles he sold have been returned since he put out the recall notice. `` They're still coming in as we speak,'' he said in a telephone interview. But is it too late? Missouri bullfrogs can grow to a foot long, raising mayhem in garden ponds four to six years from now when they reach maturity. `` If you put an American bullfrog on one side of the ecological scales, everything is going to fall off the other side because it will gobble it all up,'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, the naturalist who alerted the garden center, was quoted as telling The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. At the time they went on the market, the bullfrogs seemed like no more than a novelty item _ something to scare off cats or herons on the prowl for goldfish. <PERSON> Barratt </PERSON> said an outbreak of marauding <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bullfrogs in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> several years ago set off the fears. `` We were fairly ignorant on this subject,'' he said. `` Hindsight is a wonderful thing.'' `` Once we heard the full facts and were aware of what could happen we took a decision straight away to recall them,'' he said. <PERSON> Barratt </PERSON> thinks people may be leaping to conclusions about the threat. So long as the bullfrogs are n't released into the wild, he does n't see them going on the rampage. Nonetheless, he has put up signs in his store apologizing to frog-lovers for the inconvenience and offering to refund them the $ 1.85 price of each tadpole. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>, R-Mo., says the news made him jump `` After hearing this, I hopped over to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to deliver this sad news to my colleagues,'' he said recently in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Lest the tiny creatures of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> croak, it is far better that our <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bullfrogs be recalled. Sounds like a horror film _ ` The Bullfrogs That Ate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.' `` And so, my colleagues, I stand before you warts and all. `` As a responsible Missourian, I believe that although we should not leap to conclusions, we must ensure our frogs do not cause any undue harm in the land of <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` So we welcome our British brethren to send back both our tadpoles and foot-long bullfrogs back home. `` Imagine _ a foot-long frog! `` Who would believe it? `` It's no wonder they call <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> the ` Show Me State.''' <PERSON> Barratt </PERSON> said the recalled tadpoles are being returned to the supplier, who imported them from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. But he did not know whether they were being shipped back to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked to lengthen his delegate lead over a contentious <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> primaries on Tuesday as the Democratic presidential campaign turned predictable. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought a consolation prize in the District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a large lead in pre-election polls in the two Midwestern states. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was favored even more strongly in the heavily black nation's capital. But the day's delegate arithmetic clearly favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, now seemingly the prohibitive favorite to lock up the nomination weeks before the Democratic National Convention convenes in July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> picked 159 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> 79 and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> 16. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, whose candidacy has been embraced in recent days by a slow but steady trickle of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, began the day with nearly 1,300 of the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, a lead of nearly 450 in The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count over his sole remaining rival. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides conceded <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s victory in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in advance, but said they hoped it would be his last of the primary season. If the Democratic primaries seemed to hold little suspense, there was absolutely no mystery at all on the Republican side. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faced no active ballot opposition in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> or elsewhere. He arranged an `` Over the Top'' victory celebration at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel to celebrate the mathematical lock he gained on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination last week. Despite his certain nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned energetically in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, previewing campaign themes for use in the fall against the Democrats. He accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of foreign policy inexperience and sought to depict him and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as advocates of policies that hearken back to the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> era. On the left, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was being squeezed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who turned up the heat on his Democratic rival after last week's landslide loss in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He outspent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> television campaigning by a margin of 4-to-1, and roughed up the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for the first time in a broadcast commercial. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to stay the course. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to manage the damage,'' said the commercial. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants to change the course of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined to be drawn into a battle with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as he campaigned with his attention divided between the primary calendar and the general election campaign. In blue collar precincts, he sharply criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to veto trade legislation over a provision requiring notification to workers before a plant can be closed.

 The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor spent four days campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, but figured only a two-day swing through next week's primary states in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> would be sufficient to move them into his column A new poll in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a handsome lead in the state which selects 314 delegates _ the largest single prize in the nation _ in a June 7 primary. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, one of several campaign dropouts, was quoted by one of his own supporters as saying the time had come to rally around the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. A few delegates backing Sens. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ both of whom have suspended their campaigns _ converted to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> side, as well. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nomination moved toward the inevitable, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the first time lashed out at his opponent. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor turned aside <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s criticism by saying, `` I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer,'' and criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> instead. He frequently mentioned the plant closing legislation and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s intended veto He said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, a labor economist by training, had once suggested in a book that displaced workers need up to a year to adjust. `` Maybe the secretary can help the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> understand the trauma and agony and pain of being laid off,'' he said. He criticized the administration on foreign policy, as well. `` I want to know why we were doing business with -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, why they were paying off <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, why they were doing business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator,'' he said. `` That's the first thing we need, a full explanation, and I think the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are entitled to it.'' While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned his attention increasingly to the fall campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> decided to step up his challenge for the nomination. He squelched campaign aides who were uttering semi-concessions of defeat in the nominating race, and began demanding that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> be bolder and more specific in his campaign. `` So far, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has operated with caution when we must operate with courage, clarity and candor,'' he said at one point, pressing his rival to speak out on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and economic issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> devoted more time than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did to campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, saying he did n't intend to project overconfidence. He criticized the Democrats wherever he went, scorning <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at one point for heeding `` macho'' advice from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on foreign policy. `` I ca n't wait for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter. And I'd say, What would you do about it?'' He sought to link <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s views to the tough economic times found by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1981. `` The country wants to move ahead, not go back to the misery we inherited,'' he said.. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he was prepared to fire back if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to make an issue of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his legal difficulties. `` There is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a guilt-by-association mode where we can find in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics or campaign stuff or things of that nature,'' he said. `` I hope we do n't have to do it.''

 Police arrested 175 chanting anti-abortion demonstrators at a medical center today, one day after more than 500 protesters were arrested while blocking the entrance to a doctor's office. By mid-morning, half the estimated 350 demonstrators who converged on the <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> had been arrested, charged with disorderly conduct and released, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Venetucci </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Spokesman <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> of Operation Rescue said the demonstrators were holding a `` peaceful, prayerful presence in an effort to block the doors'' at the office. Operation Rescue has been holding daily protests at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> abortion clinics. On Monday, police arrested 503 demonstrators as they sat or lay in the street in an effort to block the entrance to gynecologist Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>'s office on the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. All of those arrested were given summonses for disorderly conduct and released, said Officer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Llanes </PERSON>, another police spokesman. No violence was reported. Joined by several clergymen, the group estimated at 600 people prayed and sang hymns while a smaller group of about 50 abortion-rights advocates held a counter-demonstration across the street, organizers said. Police refused to estimate the size of today's crowd. Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> issued a statement Monday, saying, `` We support all peaceful efforts to bring an end to abortion which has seen over 15 million pre-born babies aborted since the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision of 1973.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group, said the group believes in peaceful demonstrations and added that their main goal was to `` counsel women going into the clinic.'' `` We do n't harass or harangue anybody. We do n't hang onto the woman. We do n't punch her or hit her ... but we may be able to deter her by blocking access,'' Mrs. Page said. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rood </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said they had about 50 people outside the doctor's office `` to help people get access to the clinic and escort women inside.'' She said they were unable to do that because police put them across the street from the anti-abortion demonstrators. But no patients tried to enter the small residential building housing the doctor's office before the demonstration ended early in the afternoon. The doctor, who performs abortions and does pregnancy counseling, was unable to open his office because of the demonstrators, Ms. <PERSON> Rood </PERSON> said. An answering machine was on in the doctor's office all day. He did not return phone calls.

<HEAD>Finnish Prime Minister Speaks Out Against Protectionism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finnish Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> on Tuesday praised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s resistance to trade protectionism as an example for other countries. `` In defending free trade and resisting protectionist pressures, this -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration has shown responsibility that deserves recognition overseas,'' <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> said in an address prepared for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> audience. He also wished <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` the very best'' for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit at the end of May. <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON>, who met the president Monday, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during his planned pre-summit stopover in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> will get a warm welcome from a friendly people who cherish good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prime minister, who is making a week-long visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said `` the worst scenario would be a trade war between the major trading powers ... avoiding trade confrontation is now a high priority for all governments.'' In remarks that could be interpreted as criticism of some provisions of the trade bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to veto, <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> urged priority for the multilateral approach to trade over nationalist economic policies. `` It is crucial that all countries refrain from new protectionist measures'' and observe 1986 commitments at the start of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of global trade talks for a freeze on existing levels of protection, he said. Successful conclusion of the round by the end of 1990 demands constructive actions by all countries regardless of size and `` and puts a heavy responsibility'' on key players in world trade, such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. `` We should discard support for ailing industries,'' he said. If `` Buy American'' policies are acceptable, why not `` Buy Finnish?'' he asked. He said absence of subsidies for industry forces Finnish factories `` to become competitive, and stay, competitive.'' <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON>, a banker who a year ago became head of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s first conservative-led coalition government with the Social Democrats, said his country believes in the free market and wants to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in promoting multilateralism in trade.

 U.S.-led secret talks Tuesday put delegates from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> face-to-face Tuesday to seek a peace accord for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Strict secrecy surrounded the first day of the two-day meeting under the chairmanship of <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> would make no statement until after the negotiations. Officially, the talks at a small hotel in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> also encompassed independence for South African-controlled <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which shares a border with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But the region's two guerrilla groups were not invited, and delegates to the talks were expected to concentrate on a formula to pull back South African and Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The meeting follows an eight-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to get <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to withdraw 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, sent in 1975 to defend the Marxist government against pro-Western rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. South African troops are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> backing rebels and also attacking bases of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla group fighting for independence and black majority rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The Angolans sent their foreign minister, <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>, to Tuesday's talks. The negotiations marked the first publicly known meeting between the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> and Cubans. The Cubans dispatched a delegation headed by a senior member of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON>. Its five-member delegation also included military chief Gen. <PERSON> Ulises </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Doro </PERSON>, the Cuban Embassy said. But the South African team was headed by a bureaucrat, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> played down prospects of a breakthrough. The state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that `` by its nature, it -LRB- the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting -RRB- can not be much more than exploratory.'' On Monday, South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had warned against `` being too over-optimistic'' about the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> talks. `` The moment the Cubans leave that part of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and it is safe, then <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s forces will leave too,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. He made no mention of Namibian independence. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has backed the South African demand that Cuban troops leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> gives independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it has about 3,000 troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> maintains that 9,000 South Africans are backed by heavy artillery in its southern territory.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Returns No Indictments in MOVE Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special grand jury today called city officials' conduct in the 1985 MOVE siege that led to 11 deaths `` totally unacceptable,'' but returned no criminal indictments in what it called the city's greatest tragedy. Eleven people died and 61 homes were destroyed on May 13, 1985, when police dropped a bomb on a barricaded west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> row house occupied by the radical group MOVE. `` Applying the law to the facts as we find them, no charges are warranted, yet we do not exonerate the men responsible for this disaster,'' the grand jury said in its 279-page report. `` Rather than a vindication of those officials, this report should stand as a permanent record of their morally reprehensible behavior. `` This city, its leaders and citizens, must never forget the terrible cost of their misjudgments.'' The confrontation started after neighbors who had been targets of threats and harassment for several years told authorities they would try to evict MOVE themselves unless the city acted. The grand jury report, released this afternoon, denounced the city's planning for and actions in the siege as incompetent and inept. It especially castigated Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>. `` As the city's chief executive officer and the man legally responsible for law enforcement in the city, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> delegated too much, deferred too often, and asked too few questions,'' the report said. The MOVE group championed back-to-nature rituals, lived in filth with rats and other animals, refused to send their children to school and disobeyed health and safety laws. It was decimated by the disaster, and most of its living members are now in jail. The report said other top officials also were uninformed, including the city's No. 2 executive at the time, former Managing Director <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. During the confrontation, when police gunfire failed to drive out the MOVE members, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> approved a plan to drop an explosive device on the row house from a helicopter. The bomb started a fire, not immediately fought, that eventually destroyed 1 -LCB- city blocks and killed 11 people, five of them children, in the fortified MOVE compound. Damage caused by the police action already has exceeded $ 20 million, including rebuilding the burned-down neighborhood. The grand jury said it considered criminal charges involving conspiracy, murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault and other charges. It determined in not bringing charges, `` that <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s conduct was not reckless under the law; that is, that he did not consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that people would be placed in danger of death or serious bodily injury'' by the dropping of the bomb. A federal grand jury _ which has been probing for more than a year whether the civil rights of the 11 victims were unconstitutionally violated _ is nearing the end of its work. A report from the federal panel, with a possibility of indictments, is expected in a few months, possibly by the start of summer. Beside police participants, others criticized by the mayor's investigating commission were <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who ran operations at the MOVE scene, former police commissioner <PERSON> Gregore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sambor </PERSON>, who planned the bombing, and Fire Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, accused of delaying fighting the blaze because officials allegedly hoped the flames would drive out the occupants

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should pass a universal health insurance plan similar to the one signed into law last month by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Califano </PERSON>, who was secretary of health, education and welfare during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said all other industrialized nations make health care or insurance available to their citizens. He said his son is working and studying at a West German hospital and receives full health coverage for $ 45 a month. `` We can do it in this country. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plan provides a model,'' <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on education and health at a hearing on the future of health care in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The plan advanced by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, gives tax incentives to employers who offer health insurance to their employees and sets up a state fund to help the unemployed, the self-employed and others buy insurance for themselves at subsidized rates. The cost is estimated at $ 645 million over the next five years. Universal health insurance was one of three changes which <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said he would make if he were trying to improve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health care and had no limits on what he could spend. He said he would also mount a huge health education and disease prevention campaign, and spend `` an enormous amount of money'' on research into addiction and the afflictions of the aged, particularly incontinence, immobility and memory loss. <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said at least $ 1 billion a year should be spent on aging research and a new institute on addiction should be created at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to study all forms of substance abuse, including smoking. `` The cost of addiction in health care alone easily exceeds $ 50 billion. Yet out of a total health research budget of $ 6 billion, the government spends less than $ 200 million to learn about addiction,'' said <PERSON> Califano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> also offered ways to hold down health care costs, among them capping malpractice awards and setting treatment standards based on what is proven to work. The latter would help reduce unnecessary procedures and hospital admissions, he said. Authorities also need `` a sea change in community attitudes'' to help them start eliminating 400,000 excess hospital beds that are costing $ 12 billion a year to maintain, <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said. `` Closing hospitals is hard labor,'' <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> acknowledged. `` Everyone admits we have too many hospital beds in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ they're just all in someone else's town, city or neighborhood.'' <PERSON> Califano </PERSON>, author of a 1986 book called `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the major stumbling block to his recommendations is the health care industry. `` For these efforts to succeed, to have any hope of restraining costs, the political system has to free itself from domination by health care providers,'' <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said. He said their political action committees spent more on congressional races in the last election cycle than any other industry except financial services. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON>, of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the trend toward higher spending on health care is inevitable and desirable. He said more and more money is becoming available for health care as national income increases. The aging of the population also contributes to higher expenditures, he said, as does the willingness of people to pay for more care, demonstrated by the rise in adult orthodontia.

 Rescue teams Tuesday searched for at least 32 people missing after a children's hospital in the northern state of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> collapsed and killed at least 17 people, news reports said. The three-story brick wing of the government-owned hospital in the town of <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, 340 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, collapsed at 6:30 a.m. Monday. Floodlights were put up around the wreckage of the building to aid the rescue efforts, but <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said rescuers had lost hope of finding anyone alive. `` It is a terrible sight up there,'' <PERSON> Joshi </PERSON> said. `` No one knows how many children have died or are dying.'' At least 17 bodies were recovered from the debris, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It said at least 23 people were injured and 32 others, including 22 children, were believed to be buried under the rubble. The hospital wing's four wards contained 17 beds, with more than one child sleeping in some of them, according to the Statesman newspaper. Visitors and hospital staff were also believed to be among the victims, the newspaper said. But state-run television, quoting a local government statement, said only 10 bodies were recovered from the site. It said army personnel, police and civilian workers were continuing rescue operations. Structural defects were blamed for the collapse, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Three civil engineers who oversaw the construction of the wing have been suspended and authorities are seeking the contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Kasturi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gupta </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said. <PERSON> Satish </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> police department spokesman, said the collapse was apparently caused by a weak foundation under the 4-year-old building. Most stores and businesses in <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> and neighboring towns were closed Tuesday in sympathy for the victims and their families.

<HEAD>Army Wants To Build New Laboratory In Utah, Officials Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> wants to go ahead and build a new biological warfare test laboratory in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> despite strong public opposition, administration officials said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has temporarily shelved its proposal to construct the facility at Dugway Proving Grounds but plans to seek the money again next year, the officials testified to a trio of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees. They said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has unilaterally renounced any use of biological weapons but still needs to conduct research in the field because of germ weapons that might be developed by nations like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protect him and her against those who would use biological weapons,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of defense. `` We must provide the masks, detectors, vaccines, and so on ... `` The controversy involves <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> plans to build a $ 5.4 million lab which would have a `` bio-safety level four -LRB- B-4 -RRB-,'' the highest standard of protection. Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, who represents the area, noted that the lab would have the capability `` to convert these lethal pathogens into aerosol form.'' `` And it is this dangerous aerosol capability that is setting off alarm bells throughout the scientific community, both internationally and in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, as to the public safety and wisdom of building the Dugway facility,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. Officially, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shut down its biological weapons program, which was based at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in 1969 and announced that future research in the field would be limited to `` defensive'' purposes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also a party to a 1972 treaty banning possession of biological weapons, but the pact lacks enforcement or verification provisions. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> and other administration officials repeatedly emphasized Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s research program was only defensive and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not use germ weapons. `` It would be impossible for us to use biological weapons because we do n't have them,'' said <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>. `` We would never use biological weapons against anybody.'' But legislators questioned <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> closely about the Army research program. Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., noted that `` the line between offensive and defensive biological agents seems fuzzy at best. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> noted that while the lab would be constructed to a B-4 standard, the Army's planned experiments could be done in a B-3 lab. The higher safety level is sought as a public protection, he said. Army Col. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, who oversees the testing program, said there are `` no plans to use genetically engineered material'' in the Dugway facility. Some of the biological agents tested at Dugway are shipped through regular mails, officials said. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has `` an active research program'' to build germ weapons. `` In contrast to the openness we have practiced regarding our military programs, the Soviets, to date, have never officially acknowledged even having a biological weapons program,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program is open to inspection. But some parts of it remain secret because `` we do not want to expose our vulnerabilities in any area,'' he said. The officials testified at a joint hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs arms control subcommittee, the Interior subcommittee on energy and the environment, and the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on military installations and facilities.

<HEAD>Experiment Tries to Curb Melaleuca Threat to Everglades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Everglades will disappear if the melaleuca tree is not curbed, but an experimental herbicide program could help stop the spread of the thirsty Australian import, experts said Tuesday. Aerial spraying began last week in the <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but will take up to 10 months to evaluate, said the park's chief biologist, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>. The melaleuca was imported in 1906 to sow in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, which was then seen as just `` a mucky wasteland,'' said biologist <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. Those bringing in the tree hoped it would turn the land into a productive timbering area. The idea worked only too well, and by the time scientists and the public realized the enormous environmental value of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, the melaleuca was beginning to wipe parts of the habitat out. The thirsty Australian tree soaks up water rapidly, and thrives in fertilizer-enriched waters that now flow into the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. The proliferation of melaleuca crowds out the native plants, which evolved in an era when the water had few nutrients. `` It's now invaded a half-million acres, and 40,000 acres are solid melaleuca,'' Ms. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. She refers to the tall, thin trees with papery bark as `` weed trees.'' If the tree is not stopped, the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> will eventually disappear under a forest of melaleuca, biologists fear. The tree is hard to control because it grows rapidly and because it has an unusual defense mechanism: It sends out a load of airborne seeds at the first sign of heat from a fire or even the chop of an ax. <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said the melaleuca and the deteriorating water quality are the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>' two biggest environmental problems. Since 1985, <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION> and other Everglades-area parks have been using `` hack and squirt'' methods to control the tree, said <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>. That labor-intensive process involves hacking each tree and injecting an herbicide. Trees are also uprooted and seedlings are pulled and burned. The method has eliminated about 50,000 melaleuca, but <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> estimates hundreds of thousands remain in his park alone. Last week's spraying test could be a first step in finding a cheaper, faster method of controlling the melaleuca. Utility companies have been using the spray to control growth along their transmission lines with good results, <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said. But a refuge is not a utility company, and the effects of the aerial spraying must be carefully evaluated, he said. `` We have to worry about the other plants, the wildlife and the period of time the chemical stays in the habitat,'' <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said. Something must be done, however, he said. `` If we do n't stop the melaleuca, we are going to lose all the native habitat anyway,'' said the biologist.

 Israeli tanks and troops pushed unchecked through Arab villages and towns to within four miles of Syrian positions Tuesday in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest incursion into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in two years. The tanks rolled north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone and backed up hundreds of heavily armed troops who combed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rugged southern foothills, searching for Palestinian guerrillas Lebanese police said Syrian forces went on `` maximum alert'' as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fighters neared Syrian troops. No clashes were reported. The operation was part of a push into the southeastern <LOCATION> Arkoub </LOCATION> region that began Monday evening. The army said the incursion aimed at smashing anti-Israeli guerrilla groups responsible for recent raids into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the pre-dawn darkness, before helicopter gunships began troop transport, Israeli artillery shelled areas around <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> and several nearby villages. No one was reported hurt. Then about 500 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, armed with automatic weapons and rocket launchers, were flown to the northern edge of <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, a police spokesman said. Six Israeli tanks and nine armored personnel carriers later rolled into the town, about 1 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> created the zone in 1985 after it withdrew its army, which had occupied <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1982. Israeli troops conducted what appeared to be a house-to-house search in the town, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with standing regulations. Before the search began Israeli troops sealed off all approaches to <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> and five surrounding villages. Helicopters dropped leaflets calling on the population to cooperate in the search for guerrillas. Only villagers who work for the Lebanese regular army were allowed to leave. This reporter, who lives in <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, was also allowed to leave after he showed his <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> card. Israeli troops also entered five other Arkoub villages policed by a <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> battalion of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and conducted a 10-hour search for guerrillas, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. They said the Israelis finished the search in the midafternoon. It was not clear whether anyone was detained. Later Tuesday, about 400 ground troops were seen entering <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION>, in the far northeastern corner of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Some flashed `` V'' for victory signs. Others sang Israeli nationalist songs. A police spokesman said the Syrian command ordered its estimated 16,000 troops in the nearby <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on maximum alert. <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> is four miles from <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> positions. `` There have been no clashes, but the Syrians have their tanks dug in on hills overlooking the Israeli operational zone,'' the police spokesman said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would not lead to a prolonged entanglement or provoke a confrontation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` There's totally no danger of entanglement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am certain that the Israeli army took into account all the possibilities.'' He described the operation as part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of conducting sweeps in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and added: `` It is a usual action of watching and securing the area from attacks by terrorists.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in a statement that he `` deplores this further violation of Lebanese sovereignty.'' He also called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration called for withdrawal of all foreign forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central government in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, its power eroded by 13 years of civil war between pro-Syrian Moslems and Israel-allied Christians, ordered its U.N. Ambassador, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to lodge a `` strongly worded complaint'' against the Israeli action with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. An Israeli commander in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who was not identified by name, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that he told soldiers: `` This operation is not a night-long operation in which you go in now and return in the morning. Do n't be speedy in pressing the trigger ... but if you do shoot, you mean it seriously and shoot in order to kill.'' <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> force in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said it appeared 1,500 to 2,000 Israeli troops were involved in the operation. But Israeli sources said fewer than 1,000 were taking part. The operation was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since February 1986, when it sent more than 1,000 troops and dozens of tanks into south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to search for two soldiers captured by Lebanese guerrillas. The soldiers were never found. The 100-square-mile <PERSON> Arkoub </PERSON> was the main base of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas for cross-border attacks into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The region was then known as <LOCATION> Fatahland </LOCATION>, after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction Palestinian and leftist guerrillas have lately been active again in the Arkoub and have conducted several raids into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say the increase in cross-border raids is linked to the five-month Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The Israeli incursion followed two such raids last week in which two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and five guerrillas were killed. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker, maintains 25,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to try to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that `` no policy or decision'' he's made has been influenced by astrology, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> follows astrology and checks it in terms of the president's activities. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were not happy about the sudden focus on astrology and the first couple. `` They both feel it's unfortunate and a distraction and hardly relevant to the business of government,'' he said. `` It's true that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has an interest in astrology,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. `` She has for some time, particularly following the assassination attempt in March of 1981. She was very concerned for her husband's welfare, and astrology has been a part of her concern in terms of his activities.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know whether the president himself had consulted any astrologers, but noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has mentioned `` lucky numbers'' in speeches and has jokingly referred to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s ghost living in the family quarters. One newspaper said that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had insisted on the date and time for the signing of the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles after consulting an astrologer. `` I do n't know in any detailed sense'' if that is true, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> astrologer asserted in an interview that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has used astrology throughout his career, using astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events.'' The astrologer, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>, also claimed she helped <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first presidential campaign choose <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his running mate She did not provide specific evidence to back up her claim. Moreover, she said she `` spent a lot of time'' at the White House after the assassination attempt. Asked about her statement, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I would n't be surprised we start hearing from all kinds of astrologers because of this.'' He said they would be `` coming out of the walls.'' Former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, in a new book, claims Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to astrologers to help determine the president's schedule. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about the reports while signing a proclamation in the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, said he was making it a policy not to comment on books by former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers. However, he added, `` no policy or decision in my mind has ever been influenced by astrology.'' Asked if astrology played a part in shaping his schedule, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said with a smile, `` You know I'm still looking for the fellas that tell me every day what I'm going to do.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked what he thought about the Reagans using astrologists. He replied with a grin: `` It's all right with me. I'm glad he consults somebody.'' `` We should check whether -LRB- astrologer -RRB- <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> recommended a veto of the trade bill,'' added <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> added, `` It's a full moon out there Now that's what brings the crazies out.'' Current and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides, meanwhile, expressed skepticism about the reports. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said `` I'm not aware that any changes were made'' in the president's schedule because of astrological forecasts. Asked whether the first family made decisions based on astrology, she replied, `` Do n't you read your horoscope?'' <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide and associate of the Reagans for more than two decades, said, `` I have never once heard her allude to astrology or to the stars or to the moon or to the sign of the ram.'' He said the president liked to read his horoscope and `` laughed about it and kidded about it, but I have never seen him take the stuff seriously. `` I can never recall a single time when we did something politically because somebody said the stars are wrong,'' added <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, another longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> associate and one-time deputy presidential chief of staff, said, `` I'm not interested in commenting on it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> astrologer whose daily horoscope is distributed to more than 100 newspapers by <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said today that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have regulary consulted with astrologers. `` It's an input that they receive. I do n't like to use the word rely,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said. `` The president has used astrology throughout his career, using astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events. Look at when he holds his news conferences. They're usually during a full moon. He chooses those times to do it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> says she list politicians among her clientele, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawmakers, aides and campaign officials. She refused to reveal their names. Asked point-blank whether she had done consulting for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, she replied, `` I never discuss clients.'' However, she said she was at the White House after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assassination attempt in 1981 and helped unidentified campaign officials in the choosing of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president in 1980 `` I have been to the White House. I spent a lot of time at the White House after the assassination attempt in March,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said. `` There was talk that I did charts for all eight -LRB- vice presidential -RRB- candidates. I do n't deny that. I determined the only winnable choice was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is expected to document examples in which Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used astrology to determine the timing of speeches, major events and announcements in his soon-to-be-released book, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The Inquirer, citing unidentified <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources, said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted that the president and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sign the INF treaty at 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 8. According to the sources, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was adamant about the time even when aides suggested rescheduling the event. Newsweek magazine and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported on Monday that the scheduling of major events had sometimes been changed because the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> said an astrologer had indicated another time would be better. The president was aware of the practice and approved of it, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted a number of astrologers, including <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Righter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> astrologer mentioned in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1965 autobiography, `` Where's The Rest Of Me?'', the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Righter </PERSON>, who prepared astrological stars for several <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stars, died Saturday at the age of 88. Using the signs of the zodiac, on which horoscopes are based, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, born on Feb. 6, is an Aquarius. His wife, born on July 6, is a Cancer.

 A man pulled a gun and opened fire at a Post Office window today after he was told his Social Security check could not be found, and two postal workers injured before the assailant himself was wounded, officials said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordenet </PERSON>, a postal spokesman, said that when the shots were fired about 40 customers and employees `` hit the floor.'' There were no other injuries and the entire incident lasted about one minute, he said. The clerk at the general delivery window was treated at the scene for a scalp wound, while a postal security officer, who exchanged shots with the gunman, was hit in the upper arm and taken to a hospital. <PERSON> Bordenet </PERSON> identified the gunman as <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who had been hit in the buttocks, was arrested by police officers outside the post office, <PERSON> Bordenet </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was taken by ambulance to <ORGANIZATION> Harborview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where he was listed in satisfactory condition. <PERSON> Bordenet </PERSON> said the incident began shortly after <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> entered the post office about 9 a.m. in search of his Social Security check. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> appeared angry when the check could not be found and confronted <PERSON> Fatish </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Varma </PERSON>, who was staffing the general delivery window, <PERSON> Bordenet </PERSON> said. `` The guy became more and more angry ... <PERSON> Varma </PERSON> tried to calm him,'' <PERSON> Bordenet </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned American diplomats and businesses around the world Tuesday to guard against terrorist retaliation for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` The government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has practiced terrorism for the past nine years,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Senior Iranian officials in recent weeks have threatened terrorist acts in retaliation for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions in the gulf.'' `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takes all such threats seriously and has advised posts to take appropriate precautions,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. A warning was sent last Wednesday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic missions, military installations and American companies operating abroad. The government keeps the private concerns informed of security conditions because they also have been targets of anti-American action. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted the warning as saying: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government possesses information which leads it to believe that the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will authorize terrorist attacks against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets in the very near future. We further believe that these attacks will be deliberately designed to cause <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fatalities and or destruction to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. facilities.'' It said the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were the most likely areas for attack, `` although no area can be completely precluded as an area of operation.'' Since the increase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, notably the buildup of naval forces protecting shipping in the waterway, American posts abroad have been under a general alert to guard against terrorism. The sense of danger was heightened after April 18, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sank or crippled several Iranian ships and destroyed two oil platforms in the gulf, reportedly killing 44 Iranians. The military action prompted Iranian threats. The day after the attack, Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said `` we declare that we will forcefully respond to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s bullying in attacking oil platforms and killing innocent people.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashami </PERSON> said, `` American interests in the world, whether in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Western or <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries or even inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, should be directly attacked by the forces of the Islamic revolution in the world and the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> cells in various countries.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is the Iranian-sponsored group identified by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the kidnappers of several Americans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Keyhan </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified spokesman for the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> as saying on Monday: `` If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intends to perpetrate a new mischief, it will without any doubt, taste the bitterness of our hit-backs that will not be confined to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. We will retaliate -LRB- against -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mischief in any fields, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests throughout the world will be attacked by Muslims who sympathize with the Islamic revolution.''

<TEXT>
 Doctors separated 17-month-old Siamese twins, joined at the head, in an intricate operation Tuesday that took 7 -LCB- hours, officials at <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Baragwanath </ORGANIZATION> hospital reported. They described the surgery by a 40-member medical team on <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> as successful. The hospital is in the huge black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, mother of the girls, said: `` I feel so happy. ... I want to sleep a little, pray and thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for all he has done.'' A statement by the hospital said <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON>, the stronger of the two, was doing well but <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> suffered extensive blood loss and was in critical condition. It did not elaborate. Last September, doctors at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, separated West German twins joined at the head. The two boys, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, survived and were released in March, but are said to have some physical and mental problems. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> doctors advised those at <LOCATION> Baragwanath </LOCATION> on the difficulties they were likely to face. Members of the medical team performed two operations on the girls last October in preparation for Tuesday's surgery. In those operations, doctors partially clamped a shared major blood vessel in the twins' heads in hopes that lesser blood vessels would take over its functions. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipschitz </PERSON>, chief of the surgical team, told a news conference last Friday chances for success were not good. `` This is going to be a ... lengthy, intricate operation which carries many dangers with it,'' he said. `` The prognosis is still very grave.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, an unmarried, 33-year-old domestic worker who earns about $ 60 a month, gave birth to the twins Dec. 7, 1986. She attended a prayer service in the hospital chapel Tuesday morning. About 100 people, most of them nurses and patients, said prayers and sang hymns for the girls. The mother said she had been horrified by giving birth to Siamese twins and refused to see the girls for three days, but `` once persuaded to see them, I immediately accepted and loved my little gifts from God.'' They had a combined weight of 33 pounds before the surgery. <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> appears to be developing normally and recently began to speak, but <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced, said officials at <LOCATION> Baragwanath </LOCATION>, the main hospital in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> was asked to make a $ 5 contribution to the costs of the operations and related care, which will total hundreds of thousands. The costs are being absorbed by the hospital and the <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical school. The Sowetan, a daily newspaper that covers the black township, established a trust fund for the twins and the equivalent of about $ 26,000 has been raised.

It looks like there may be some benefit here.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ordered communities with large numbers of poor families to begin school breakfasts in January 1987. The Lawrence study began three months after the law took effect. Test scores from 335 children in the program were compared to scores from 688 children who were not. Almost all the children were from poor families. Among the results: _ Test scores showed greater improvement for children in the breakfast program. Their scores went up 13.5 percent the following year, compared to 11 percent for children not in the program. _ Children in the program were late or absent less frequently, and breakfast eaters made fewer mistakes in the morning. School lunches are now available to most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children, but breakfast is offered to about 40 percent. The study estimates about 600,000 children skip breakfast every day. Cost is a problem. The federal government spent $ 400 million in 1986 to serve breakfast to 33,000 public school students, <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said.

 Three girls accused of conspiring to kill an assistant principal by putting lye in his coffee have pleaded guilty to a reduced charge, officials said. A seventh-grader and two ninth-graders at <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in east-central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> admitted to juvenile delinquency petitions _ the juvenile court equivalent of guilty pleas _ accusing them of conspiracy to commit bodily harm by adulteration. `` It means they conspired to put poison in their assistant principal's coffee cup, but it was n't intended to kill him,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Juvenile Court Judge J.E. <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> said. On Feb. 25, Vice Principal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Espelien </PERSON> became suspicious when he saw a brownish-tan substance, which tests later showed was lye, floating in his coffee cup. <PERSON> Espelien </PERSON> did not drink the coffee. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney's office filed juvenile petitions accusing the students of conspiring to commit murder in the first degree. The girls were suspended from school and later expelled for the remainder of the 1987-88 term. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, juvenile court matters are usually kept confidential, but in certain situations judges have discretion to disclose some facts of a case. <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> said he decided to release some information because of widespread public interest in the case, but declined to reveal what, if any, penalties were applied. `` I wish I could release more information,'' <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> said. `` These cases do n't have a lot of value as deterrents to crime unless the public knows what happened in court.''

 Lines snaked outside federal immigration centers in cities around the country Tuesday, as thousands of undocumented aliens applied for legal residency status a day ahead of the deadline for the yearlong program. To accommodate late applicants, all 107 offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will remain open until midnight Wednesday, the deadline for the yearlong amnesty program. Many district offices extended hours Tuesday, too. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the line of applicants stretched around the block Tuesday morning, as people waited for the district office to open, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocetti </PERSON>, acting deputy district director. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Crocetti </PERSON> said his office was processing 15 to 20 applications a day. Now it's more than 200 a day. `` I just kept procrastinating, but the time just caught up with me,'' <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said Tuesday as she waited with 750 other people at the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Her sister, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, who applied for amnesty in January, persuaded her to apply, she said. `` The applications are finally coming in,'' said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where more than 500 applicants stood in line at midday outside the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office. As of Sunday, 1.33 million applications had been received, according to the INS. An additional 464,000 people are seeking legal status under a separate program for seasonal agricultural workers. The deadline for that program is Nov. 30. Applicants who file by the deadline also may request up to 60 days for submitting other documents necessary to prove they have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982. `` We've gotten dramatically busier in the last few days,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, chief legalization officer for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which handles applications from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` Our average throughout the program has been about 28 applications a day but last week we had 828, which works out to over 160 a day. And -LRB- Monday -RRB- alone we had 329 applicants and I expect to surpass that by a good deal today.'' In <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office received 204 applications on Monday; it had received 454 applications in the preceding three weeks. However, about 90 percent of the applicants came from farm workers who have the longer deadline. `` We knew it was going to happen this way,'' said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON>, chief immigration officer for North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, nearly 1,000 <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> applicants for political asylum lined up overnight at the main federal building, mistakenly believing that they, too, faced a deadline. `` I had to call up a couple of federal police officers to assist. There was a mob outside,'' guard <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` It was like a stampede when we opened the doors at 5 a.m.'' The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> district, which covers <LOCATION> Nothern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, is handling close to 4,000 applications a day, up from a high of about 600 a day in early February, according to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> immigration offices have mostly escaped long lines, but local <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said Tuesday the number of applications had increased sharply recently. `` It's been running about 2,000 a day,'' he said. `` But we have no problem taking applications.'' About 110,000 people have applied for amnesty there, and <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said he expects the total to reach 125,000. One reason the program has not had as great an impact in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is that the two most populous immigrant groups _ Cubans and Haitians _ had their situation legalized under special legislation that followed the 1980 Mariel boatlift, said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said he expected a `` last-minute push'' Wednesday and promised `` we'll take everyone _ even if we have to wake'em up in line.''

 South-West African guerrilla leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said Tuesday he had come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to meet with the three presidential candidates and seek their support for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s expulsion from the territory, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said he had been assured by campaign managers for Democratic hopefuls <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he would meet with the two candidates during his stay here. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not responded to his request for a meeting, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, also said he had received assurances from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s interests would be faithfully represented at negotiations being held in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Tuesday between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>, South African, Cuban and Angolan representatives. The talks are designed to get <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to pull out its 37,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, in return for a pullout of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s estimated 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> `` It will be a package, I am assured of this by the Angolan government,'' he said in an interview. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is doing `` all it can to strengthen its hold'' on the mineral-rich territory, stepping up a campaign of arson and bombing attacks against <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s predominantly black population of 1.5 million, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said. He accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of burning down 14 Namibian church schools last month. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has no intention whatsoever to leave <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who has lived in exile for 28 years, the last 12 in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The South Africans will have to be `` forced out by the combined resistance of the Namibian people and international pressure.'' He commended the economic sanctions imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1986 and urged the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to take further steps to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into relinquishing <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said he had requested a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> but had not received any response. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said she did not know of such a request. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports a South African pullout and an independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but its contacts with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> have been limited. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is ruling <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under an expired League of Nations mandate, in defiance of a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution which calls for Namibian independence. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> also said that should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be willing to supply <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> with weapons `` we will certainly accept it with great pleasure.'' Most of the group's arms and training come from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and several other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and the Scandinavian countries supply humanitarian assistance to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ The following was based on a Pentagon news pool
report.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS CORONADO IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> remains a dangerous foe in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> despite heavy losses in battles with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago. `` I believe the Iranians would clearly like to damage us, to hurt us, to humiliate us if they could,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the nation's top military commander, said during a surprise visit to the gulf. `` I think terrorism is one of the ways that they might try to do it. It's a very serious threat.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> presided at an awards ceremony on the sun-baked after deck of the 15,000-ton USS Coronado. He plans to visit at least three of the 28 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the area, including the mine-damaged 3,700-ton guided missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, on his two-day tour. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has warned <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> not to mount new military actions in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and has threatened reprisals from anywhere in the world. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> media pool. The admiral said he was disappointed at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision against sending six fast <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters to help patrol the gulf. `` They would have been very useful in these shallow waters because we need fast boats with shallow drafts,'' he said. `` They are the best patrol boats in the world and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had no substitute.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he was aware of, but could not confirm, reports that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may have 100 new C-801 type Chinese missiles, a much more sophisticated missle than the land-based, anti-ship <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silkworms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> has deployed so far. He said the Pentagon still had not decided if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> actually fired Silkworms at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in the April 18 battle, even though reports from ships in the area initially identified incoming missiles as Silkworms. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had warned <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would strike at coastal Silkworm missile batteries if they were ever fired at American ships. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards have used a fleet of about 50 Swedish-built Boghammer armed speed boats to harass shipping in the gulf. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said on Monday it has resumed boarding ships in the gulf to determine if they are carrying cargoes to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for use in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said `` the biggest headache is the opportunity they have to put mines out there.'' Nearly 50 mines have been found in the gulf this year, but <PERSON> Less </PERSON> said that no new ones have been detected recently by the fleet of allied mine sweepers that roam the gulf waterway through which 20 percent of the world's oil is shipped. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, 63, called the recent sea battle with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` unique in the annals of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> history'' because of the exchanges of missile fire and praised the men for their performance. In a brief ceremony on the afterdeck, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> presented awards that included the Distinguished Flying Cross, the <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and Air Medal to 13 pilots and crew members for bravery during the action April 18. During the action, American forces attacked two Iranian oil platforms and sank or disabled six naval craft in raids described by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a `` measured response'' to hostile acts, including the mining of gulf waters and firing on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that despite recent losses fighting the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> remains a dangerous force whose threats of revenge can not be dismissed. `` They have a considerable capability and they have standoff missile capability which we are always concerned about,'' Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told reporters after a shipboard ceremony. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> decorated 13 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers and men for actions during the clashes between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian naval forces in the Persian Gulf April 18. He said that although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lost six naval craft including two of its best frigates during the daylong battles, `` there are a number of threats that the Iranian navy still represents. `` I believe the Iranians would clearly like to damage us, to hurt us, to humiliate us if they could. I think terrorism is one of the ways they might try to do it. It's a very serious threat.'' A black-painted Iranian mine, inscribed with the famous World War II slogan, `` Killroy was here,'' was on display as <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> officiated at the awards ceremony in 103-degree heat aboard the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flagship Coronado. Meanwhile, a convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers headed up the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> _ the third in five days as the navy worked to get its escorted shipments of <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil back on a regular schedule. The convoys, which had been averaging about seven a month since the first of the year, were delayed for nearly two weeks after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guided missile frigate hit a mine in the central gulf and mine sweepers later found and destroyed about a dozen more. The mining of the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> on April 14 led to `` Operation Praying Mantis,'' a series of retaliatory strikes against Iranian oil platforms and other targets four days later. Two platforms were destroyed and six Iranian naval craft were sunk or disabled in the skirmishes in the southern gulf. During the action, the Iranians fired five missiles at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships but missed their targets. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter carrying two crewmen was lost during the battle. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, interviewed by members of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool, said two weeks of technical analysis had not established the type of missiles fired at the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials earlier said they were not Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles as electronic monitors aboard the American ships indicated at the time. The admiral also said he could not confirm reports that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had about 100 newer C-801 Chinese missiles, a more advanced weapon than the 30-year-old Silkworms. Among those receiving citations from <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> were navy pilots who sank or disabled <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s frigates Sahand and <LOCATION> Sabaland </LOCATION>, and others who had roles in key parts of the actions. Awards included the Distinguished Flying Cross, the <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and the Air Medal for valor. The 13, dressed in navy whites, stood in a rank on the helicopter deck to receive their medals. Witnesses, who included <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakhem </PERSON>, said one of the sailors collapsed in the oppressive heat, the most severe of any day this year. The mine displayed on the 15,500-ton warship was one of nine found aboard the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ajr, an Iranian landing craft that was disabled and captured by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last Sept. 21 after night-prowling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters discovered it sowing mines in a shipping lane of the central gulf. The mines, the familiar Russian-designed horn-type `` myam mine,'' dating back to 1908, apparently were supplied to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources have said. During his visit to the gulf region, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> will inspect the mine-damaged <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, now undergoing preliminary repair in a <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> shipyard. The 3,700-ton, two-year-old warship is to be returned to the Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, shipyard where it was built, for further work. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> also was expected to meet with top officials of gulf <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments to explain the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, under which American warships will be permitted to respond to requests for help from non-U.S. flag vessels under Iranian attack.

The operation had been anticipated since February when doctors discovered the aneurysm while repairing a more serious aneurysm discovered earlier. An aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery. A weakness in the artery wall allows the pressure of the blood to force the artery to swell outward, like a blister. The danger is that the aneurysm will burst. In the brain, even a mild leakage can be dangerous and damaging. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> For a few months last year he was a Democratic presidential candidate.

 Lying beneath a copy of the painting that made her face famous, the sister of artist Grant Wood talks of the glory _ and criticism _ she shared as the model for his `` American Gothic.'' <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, recognizeable despite the changes of nearly six decades, recalled the events leading to her posing as the stern-faced farmer's daughter for the American classic. `` He was honest,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, now 88 and blind, said of her brother, explaining why people admire or dislike the work. `` Other painters say, ` The portrait does n't look like him because I painted what he's thinking.' They hide behind words because of their lack of talent,'' she said. `` But <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> put it all down. He learned his trade and put down what he saw.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> lives in a convalescent hospital on a quiet street of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In an interview Monday, she remembered how `` American Gothic'' changed her brother's life and her own. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who had developed a straightforward style in depicting the land and people of his native <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was inspired by a house in the town of <LOCATION> Eldon </LOCATION>. Driving by the house one day, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was taken with its sole decoration, a second-story window in the form of a simple Gothic arch. `` His main idea was to -LRB- show -RRB- the kind of people he thought would live in that kind of a house,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> did n't want to disturb the residents, so he asked the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' family dentist, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeeby </PERSON>, 62, and <PERSON> Nan </PERSON>, then 30, to pose. In what became one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known paintings, McKeeby, dressed in overalls and holding a pitchfork, and <PERSON> Nan </PERSON>, hair drawn back and wearing an apron over a plain dark dress adorned only by a cameo, stand solemnly in front of the house. The rural father and daughter appear as practical and as plain as the white wooden building. But while the painting made <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s reputation, it also angered many <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers. `` They said if farmers really looked like that, they better take to bootlegging,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> recalled. She herself became the target of the farm wives' wrath. `` They thought that <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was making fun of them. So they wrote to the newspaper all sorts of insults. The worst one was ` That woman's face ... would sour milk.''' At her brother's suggestion, <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> answered the critics with a letter of her own. `` I said that I posed for it and I was proud that I had. Well, the situation changed immediately. They were very apologetic and said they did n't mean what they said,'' she said. `` They even began bringing farm products up to us ... and invited <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> to vacations on their farms.'' The Wood family was living in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION> at that time. To make up for the nasty comments, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> later painted a portait of his sister as a present. `` That was my reward,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` He thought that secretly, I was hurt.'' She was, a little, but Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has no regrets about posing.

<HEAD>Ousted Moscow Official Joins Chorus Of Commentary On Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> returned to the spotlight Tuesday to join a chorus of critics of the status quo and to support Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic restructuring drive. In an article in the daily Construction Gazette, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> called on Soviet workers to make the reforms work. He also warned the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership that it should be careful not to deceive the people and make them lose faith. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who gained wide popularity in the capital with his raids on food stores and personal inspection of public transit, was fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader on Nov. 11 after he criticized the slow pace of reforms during a closed-door meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. His ouster sent a chill through the ranks of reformists, who worried that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s removal signaled strong resistance to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts at allowing more openness about problems plaguing Soviet society. A week after losing the party job, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was named first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which carries ministerial rank but falls far short of the influence he enjoyed as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader. Construction <PERSON> Gazette </PERSON> sought <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s comments in connection with a front-page article on woes in the Soviet contruction industry, which is having to conform to the same cost-cutting and efficiency measures as the rest of the economy under the `` perestroika,'' or rebuilding, campaign. It made no reference to his former party job. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the newspaper that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms are at a `` decisive phase,'' and that the leadership should be careful to fulfill the hopes and expectations of the working people. `` This hope must not be deceived, or then it will not be easy to restore faith to the people, to elevate them to great tasks,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. Success, he said, depends on `` the support of the wide masses of workers who hope for changes for the better in their lives and link them with perestroika.'' He said the reforms could produce some long-needed improvements in the near future, including better housing, more modern medical facilities and more schools and kindergartens. Housing is still an acute problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where one family in five lives in dormitories or communal dwellings. A party program has called for the construction of enough new housing so each family will have its own home or apartment by the year 2000. The Construction Gazette article was the first mass-circulation Soviet publication to quote <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> since his departure from the party job. Last month, the inaugural German-language edition of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> carried an interview with him. That publication is printed and distributed abroad. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s public return came a day after the party daily Pravda published on its front page a letter from another government official, who criticized his fellow party members for pursuing careerist ambitions over the ideals set down by Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. The official, identified as <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, contended that party members have tainted <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s postulate that `` The party is the mind, honor and conscience of our epoch.'' He called for improvements within the party as well as industry and society as part of the restructuring campaign and introduction of more democracy in Soviet life. Tuesday night's edition of the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> carried a lengthy criticism of Soviet industry and agriculture. Prominent author <PERSON> Chingiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON> said Soviets continue to justify poor production with weak excuses about losses suffered during World War II, although countries like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> hit even harder long ago outdistanced Soviet performance. <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON>, a popular writer whose literary works attack totalitarianism, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms hold out the only hopes for improving Soviet farm and factory output. The commentaries on democratic and economic reforms appear to be part of the preparations for next month's party conference, at which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will seek broader endorsement for his campaigns and likely remove some of the more conservative forces fighting the changes he has advocated. The criticism of social and economic progress to date voiced by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Selivanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON>, and their calls for support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, embrace the leader's two main themes of greater openness and a wholesale rebuilding of the nation.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> is ready to share power with the opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> after his party's losses in legislative elections, party officials said Tuesday. Officials of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they wanted to reach an agreement with the opposition soon so the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> can hold its opening session around May 20. `` We would favorably consider an opposition demand that the parliamentary leadership be shared by parties according to their assembly seats,'' the governing party's floor leader, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoon-hwan </PERSON>, said after meeting with senior party leaders. Opposition candidates made a strong showing in legislative elections a week ago, stripping the government party of its parliamentary majority for the first time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s modern history. The three opposition parties took 164 seats in the 299-member assembly. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s party won 125 seats, 25 shy of a simple majority. A handful of independent candidates also won seats. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who was appointed floor leader in a shakeup of the party's leadership on Monday, said formal discussions of the new Assembly's leadership could start after opposition parties hold their national conventions next <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the government party wants to hold the speakership but would cede the two vice speaker's posts to the opposition. Traditionally, only one vice speaker's post has been left to the opposition. The chairmanships of 13 assembly committees should also be shared with the opposition, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. In the past, all committees were headed by governing party members. After the legislative elections, the president said he would `` humbly'' accept the outcome. He added he would work with the opposition to continue to carry out his promises for democratic reforms. In a first move to reorganize the government camp after the election, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> replaced the head of his party with a moderate senior politician. Other senior party posts also were filled with moderates. Government officials said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was expected to shake up his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, probably next week, but leave Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-hae </PERSON> in place. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> emerged as the No. 1 opposition force in the elections, said he would like to delay debates on controversial issues if they would disrupt the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Set To Kick Off AIDS Alert Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials on Wednesday will kick off an intensive three-week campaign to alert Americans about AIDS, focused around the mailing of a pamphlet on the deadly disease to every household in the nation. Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> and other top administration health leaders scheduled a news conference to officially unveil the booklet, whose contents were being kept secret Tuesday. The promotional campaign _ including television spots and posters in each of the nation's post offices _ is designed to alert Americans to be looking for the historic pamphlet when it starts showing up in mailboxes May 26. It will be the first time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has sent a health advisory directly to every American with a mailing address. The secrecy surrounding the actual content of the document stems from decision by department officials to apply a strict reading to congressional directions ordering that a national mailing be undertaken by June 30. That language in the omnibus budget bill covering the current fiscal year said the mailing was to be prepared and `` distributed without necessary clearance of the content by any official, organization or office.'' Although health department officials have been wary of discussing preparation of the document, they have acknowledged that they interpreted the wording to mean that the pamphlet's content should not be subject to prior scrutiny either by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> called for a similar mailing last year, but with less explicit language. That project was never completed, in part because of objections raised by some White House officials. One of the reasons given was that because President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had just appointed a White House AIDS commission to make recommendations on overall AIDS policy, it would be appropriate for the panel to review any mailing. However, the commission did not get into the issue at the time on grounds that it was just beginning its work and was not ready to examine specific inititives. The panel was not asked to review the current mailing and did not ask to be involved. `` The commission has not formally or informally been involved in the planning or preparation or writing of this booklet,'' spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said Tuesday in an interview. He said retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and the panel's executive director `` are familiar with some elements of it, but like everybody else in town they are waiting to see it and hope it is successful. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious, incurable isease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. The disease's chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, with a small percentage of cases attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since June 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said the pamphlet will be `` as complete as it can be within a relatively constrained format, discussing AIDS in terms of how you can get AIDS, how you ca n't get AIDS, the various precautions that can be taken, beginning of course with avoiding risky behavior.'' He said there are sections on AIDS and children, AIDS and dating, babies with AIDS `` and on people with AIDS and the rights they have and the obligations owed to them.'' Asked specifically whether it will mention condoms, <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said: `` This particular mailer addresses all aspects of AIDS and how it is communicated and how one can avoid _ or if not avoid, at least provide the best protection for the circumstances.'' Since 1986, when he issued a 36-page surgeon general's report on AIDS, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has been the administration's most vocal advocate of condom use for sexually active people who are not in monogomous relationships. That booklet has been distributed to an estimated 19 million Americans _ many via mail from individual members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who requested copies to mail to their constituents. The basic themes laid down in the 1986 report have been repeated in subsequent <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> documents. The outspoken <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s planned presence at the Wednesday announcement was an indication the mailing will adhere to the approach he has been taking on AIDS education and prevention. His spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, declined to say what role <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> had played in preparation of the mailer or whether it will state the surgeon general's position on condom use. `` It would be really difficult to leave out the surgeon general who has been the voice of this administration speaking out on AIDS since he was first asked to do the -LRB- 1986 -RRB- report by the president,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in the health department, and <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> will be making a simultaneous announcement of the mailing Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We discovered when we were in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in January -LRB- for an AIDS conference attended by health ministers from almost every country in the world -RRB- that there was a great deal of concern about what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We thought this was a good opportunity to show them what we're doing now in addition to all the things we have done before.''

<TEXT>
 Declaring that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cultural literacy is at stake,'' federal arts agency chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> said Tuesday he will make a nationwide tour to urge educators to give elementary school child at least 4 -LCB- hours of arts instruction weekly. <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> also wants to require high school students to complete the equivalent of two full years of art courses before they can graduate, twice as much as Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> proposed last December as part of his model high school curriculum. If <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> has his way, all junior high school students will be required to spend at least 15 percent of the school year studying the arts, exclusive of English studies, with special emphasis on design and the media arts such as television and movies. The proposals aimed at making the arts an integral part of the school curriculum from kindergarten through the 12th grade were contained in a 173-page report issued Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> on the state of arts education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The problem is, basic arts education does not exist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today,'' concluded the endowment, an independent federal agency which underwrites a wide variety of artistic projects with a current budget of $ 167.7 million. The report argued that the arts are no less important than reading, writing and arithmetic, by helping youngsters understand civilization, develop creativity, learn communications skills and make critical choices about `` what is good and bad.'' Nevertheless, the report said, many Americans still view the arts as a subject not worthy of serious study, and sometimes as `` potentially threatening or even blasphemous.'' Moreover, it said, school administrators can not agree on what arts education is. It cited a survey conducted three years ago which found that 61 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults had not attended a live cultural performance or visited an art gallery or museum in the previous year. Hodsoll, the endowment chairman, told a news conference he will begin a series of regional meetings around the country next week to campaign for expanded arts instruction in the schools. The first session will be held Monday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> will confer with state and local education and arts officials from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Conferences tentatively are planned for next fall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> acknowledged that his stress on the arts `` will be a problem in some school districts'' that put primary emphasis on preparing students to meet foreign competition in science and technology. But he and the endowment report noted that the high-tech Japanese have made the arts a basic part of their school curriculum. <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON> argued that study of the arts `` helps us to be masters, not servants, of technology.'' The endowment study, commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and titled `` Toward Civilization,'' prescribed stiffer curriculum requirements, improved teacher training and credentials standards, testing and evaluation to provide all students _ not just the talented or college-bound _ with a thorough education in their artistic heritage. `` Without knowledge and understanding of such supreme achievements, we are culturally illiterate,'' the report said. The report proposed that high schools require two years of art courses or other approved courses that incorporate the arts for a graduation diploma, and that they offer optional arts courses for talented students who want them. It said school administrators might consider extending the school day to seven periods to accommodate the new requirements.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday the government will not tolerate informal quotas that exclude some people of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> heritage from attending colleges or universities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the statement at a signing ceremony in the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> for a proclamation designating the week beginning May 8 as Asian-Pacific American Heritage Week. `` I know there's a growing concern that some universities may be discriminating against citizens of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> heritage, accepting a lower percentage of these applicants than get admitted from other groups, despite their academic credentials,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He did not cite any examples of discrimination.

He said his son smoked but that the friend said he was not intoxicated when he left the house. <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Laduron </PERSON> said the car was parked beside <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Highway 66 and it appeared Glass `` may have pulled off the road and gone to sleep and it caught fire.'' In the interview published Sunday in the <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> newspaper, Glass said Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboats on April 18 attacked the oil tanker on which he was safety engineer. While other crew members were evacuated, Glass remained aboard to put out fires on the vessel, which was carrying 353,000 barrels of oil. Glass, who worked 35 days on board the oil tanker and then had 35 days off, told the newspaper he hoped to get hazardous duty pay when he returned to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in a few weeks. Glass, whose survivors include a wife and son, had worked in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since 1981.

 Anti-abortion demonstrators shut a medical office where abortions are performed for the second consecutive day Tuesday and their protest produced 422 arrests. `` We have completed our objective,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, spokesman for Operation Rescue, which organized the demonstration. `` The facility was closed for the day and no babies were killed.'' Protestors from various anti-abortion groups from 20 states converged on the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> after 8 a.m. and laid down on the sidewalk and street. Dozens of officers made arrests, lifting demonstrators by stretchers and loading them onto buses. They were taken to a park, charged with disorderly conduct and released, said Officer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Swinney </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Two men from a smaller group of pro-choice demonstrators also were arrested after scuffling with police who were separating the two groups. A man who said he was a doctor answered the phone at the private clinic Tuesday morning and confirmed the center was closed because of the protest, which lasted for several hours. Police arrested 503 people for disorderly conduct Monday after <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> staged a similar demonstration outside a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> doctor's office. During both protests, the demonstrators prayed and sang hymns as police made arrests. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said the group would hold a news conference Wednesday and demonstrate again Thursday and Friday.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Tuesday it gave more favorable treatment to the World Health Organization than to other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies and paid its full 1987 budget assessment of $ 62.8 million. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, undersecretary of health and human services, said in a speech to the WHO annual assembly: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been able to pay its full assessment for the year 1987. `` Through this payment, WHO received favorable treatment over that accorded to many other organizations in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> system, including the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> itself.''

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed about 25 percent of the budgets of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its agencies. Payments have been held up by congressional stipulations that contributions depend on the effectiveness of an agency and its fairness to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments be reduced because of the American budget deficit.

 Development of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, its small towns and farms, should rest on diversification and the energies of local people, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON>, undersecretary for small community and rural development, said cooperative federal efforts now under way are helping rural communities regain economic stability. <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> said rural communities suffered from inflation in the late 1970s, global economic recession and farmland value losses in the early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production. `` In the past, rural economic development has been dependent on farm policy and income,'' he said. `` We now recognize that the future growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent on diversification at the local level, both in farm production and in the other businss segments of community and state economies.'' The 19-page report itself added: `` The current federal initiative -LRB- on rural development -RRB- stresses the need for rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to look within for development possibilities. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s small and rural communities need to realize there are simply not enough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promote development.'' Field hearings are being planned so that <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> can `` listen to the needs and concerns of the local officials, residents, students, teachers, business people and senior citizens,'' the report said. The report outlined rural economic development programs available at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and at other federal agencies.

<TEXT>
 Ten days of <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol-mania </PERSON> ended Tuesday when <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house brought down the last gavel on its sale of the late artist's personal collection. The grand total: $ 25.3 million. The sale, which featured more than 10,000 items owned by <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, attracted an estimated 60,000 people to the Sotheby galleries and set tongues wagging and jaws dropping throughout the art world. Proceeds from the auction vastly exceeded <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s official pre-auction estimate of $ 9 million to $ 13 million. While auction house officials admitted that they purposely underestimated the collection's value, they expressed surprise over the extent of the miscalculation. `` Our feeling when we figured the estimates was that we would n't add any ` Warhol factor,''' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` I think what we're seeing today is an indication not only of the ` Warhol factor' but of a very strong art market.'' For whatever reason, buyers were willing to pay dearly for just about anything owned by <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, who died in February 1987 and owned many, many things. Sales figures included $ 2,640 for three plastic watches bearing the likenesses of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Flintstone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jetson </PERSON> and Gumby; $ 23,000 for a pair of cookie jars; $ 55,000 for a set of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dali </LOCATION> ear clips; and $ 605,000 for a <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> painting, `` Sailboats.'' Proceeds from the auction go to the <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> Foundation for the <ORGANIZATION> Visual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which was established by the artist to support cultural institutions. The highest-priced item at the sale was an untitled 1967 painting by <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Twombley </PERSON> that fetched $ 990,000 _ a record for a work by that artist. It was one of many records set during the marathon sale. Works of art routinely sold for double or triple _ or more _ their estimated value. A <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hockney </PERSON> drawing of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, valued at $ 60,000 to $ 80,000, sold for $ 330,000 _ an example of the `` Warhol factor'' working overtime. `` It's a joke to attempt to buy here,'' complained one <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> art dealer, <PERSON> Geert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there are many dealers who could touch those prices _ or want to. You'd look crazy.'' `` I think the prices have no relation to the value,'' said another dealer, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> `` The <LOCATION> Warhol </LOCATION> imprimatur is just inflating prices irrationally.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> both said that private collectors, not art dealers, were doing most of the buying at the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> auction _ something Sotheby's officials disputed. `` For those of us who buy for resale, or for investment, it's not a very attractive auction,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> But for others, the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> auction was exceedingly attractive. `` It's not an exaggeration to say this was a historic event,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Deitch </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, who buys art on behalf of bank clients. `` A lot of the prices sound high to the casual bidder, but they're not insanely high,'' <PERSON> Deitch </PERSON> said. `` For instance, in the auction of the Warhol furniture, many of the pieces went for what you'd pay for new furniture.'' Anyway, he said, `` I think it sends an interesting signal that our culture values these things, and I think that as a culture we can feel very good that works of art are valued to this extent.'' <PERSON> Deitch </PERSON> predicted that anything associated with <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> would continue to escalate in value as more people come to appreciate the artist, who remains controversial in death as he was in life. `` It's just beginning,'' he said. `` Just beginning.''

<HEAD>Appeal of Dearborn Parks Case Heard</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A predominantly white suburb should have the right to `` control its own possessions'' by barring non-residents from its parks, a lawyer for the town said Tuesday. A three-judge state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel heard arguments on an appeal of a 1986 ruling overturning a referendum in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>. In November 1985, the voters in the town, located on <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s western border, had approved a measure that would ban non-residents from 35 of its 37 parks. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> challenged the law, saying it effectively discriminated against blacks from neighboring <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>, representing <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that the ruling should be overturned because the same argument could be used to strike down a number of other laws that had potential discriminatory effects. `` The plaintiffs are making an abhorrent argument, ...'' he said in an interview outside the hearing. `` The city has a right to control its own possessions.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedler </PERSON>, who argued in behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said the ordinance `` is going to make the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> parks all white.'' However, he added, the case is limited and should apply only to <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> parks. `` Our view is a very narrow one,'' he said. In September 1986, <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempien </PERSON> ruled that the ban was unconstitutional because of its possible discriminatory effect and its proposed random checks of park users for identity documents. Citing two of parks that were particularly close to predominantly black <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> neighborhoods, the judge said: `` The impact of the non-resident provisions ... is to deny the use of both <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and Crowley Park to almost every potential black user within the ... service area.'' The 1980 census showed that of about 90,000 people living in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, fewer than 100 were black. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s population at the time was about 63 percent black. Nearly a year before the ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Dearborn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-3 to reject the parks ordinance. But a petition drive put the matter on the Nov. 5, 1985, election ballot, and residents approved it in a 17,790 to 13,976 vote. Attorneys said an appeals ruling may be made within 120 days.

 Fifteen <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students have been indicted in the drinking-related death of a fraternity pledge, authorities said Tuesday. The students, including seven officers of the now-closed <LOCATION> Lambda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> fraternity, were charged with aggravated hazing, which carries a penalty of up to 18 months in prison and a $ 7,500 fine upon conviction. <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said that as first offenders, the students probably would not face prison. A grand jury in <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> returned the indictment Friday, but it was not announced until Tuesday because prosecutors wanted to tell the students and their families first. The 15 students did not have to post bail, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said. They are to appear May 20 before Superior Court Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>. Among those facing charges is fraternity chapter President <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudak </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>; Vice President <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Sewickley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and rush chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selenko </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said the officers were not charged as a result of their positions but were among fraternity members who allegedly endangered the life of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> died after a fraternity pledge party at the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity house Feb. 12. Tests revealed <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> had four times the legal amount of alcohol in his body when he slipped into a coma. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON>, vice president of public safety at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION>, said a university investigation continues and that the 15 students named in the indictment could face school charges, the most serious being expulsion. Also on Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> football player <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowther </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wadsworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, died in a car accident in which the driver had twice the legal amount of blood alcohol in his system, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said. The car, driven by <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> linebacker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Speidel </PERSON>, 21, of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, had veered into oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into a truck, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said. Tests on <PERSON> Speidel </PERSON>, who remained hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday, showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.253 percent, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said. People are considered legally intoxicated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> when blood alcohol content reaches 0.10 percent. <PERSON> Speidel </PERSON> turned 21 on Tuesday, making him younger than the legal drinking age Monday, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said. Another passenger in the car, linebacker <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garea </PERSON>, 19, from <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was in serious condition Tuesday. <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said tests were being conducted on <PERSON> Lowther </PERSON>'s body, but authorities say a preliminary investigation revealed that the three began drinking Monday afternoon in a dormitory. No charges had been filed Tuesday, <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Food Labeling System Called Confusing, Inadequate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's food labeling and information system is confusing, inadequate and in need of an overhaul, according to a congressional report released Tuesday. `` The food information system lacks common criteria. In addition, controversies surround the nutritional issues that underlie regulatory decisions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. `` Consumers need the clearest, most consistent information possible,'' the report said. But the current system sends `` confused signals'' to consumers, it said. The report was requested by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s oversight and investigations subcommittee <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> to investigate conflicting regulations on the use of cheese substitutes in frozen pizza toppings. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates meat-topped frozen pizza, requires disclosure on the front panel of the pizza box if less than 10 percent of the cheese on the pizza is `` traditional'' cheese. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates all other frozen pizza, requires front-panel disclosure if a pizza topping is not 100 percent real cheese. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reported in 1980 that <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had 119 regulations covering consumer economic protection and product safety. In 1982, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the piecemeal labeling system had led to regulatory inconsistencies and consumer confusion. The latest report said efforts to develop a workable approach to collecting and disseminating food information have lagged behind `` the explosion of manufactured food products'' _ nearly 3,400 in 1986 compared with 1,000 in 1982.

 Authorities accused a computer operator from a company that helps run the state lottery of forging a winning $ 15.2 million ticket and another man with trading it in for the jackpot. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>, 33 of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, was arraigned Tuesday, less than a week after he traded in the ticket for the first $ 469,989 installment of the prize from a Super 7 drawing last July 15. He was jailed in lieu of $ 50,000 bail. Jailed in lieu of bail Monday night was computer operator <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, also 33 of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, who tried to flee, arresting officers said. Both men were charged with theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, criminal conspiracy and forgery, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentzel </PERSON>, a spokesman for state Attorney General <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> also was charged with unlawful use of a computer and tampering with public information. If convicted, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> could be jailed for up to 31 years and fined $ 70,000, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> could face 40 years in prison and $ 90,000 in fines. There was `` no current evidence of participation by others, or of other fraudulent tickets being turned in, either here or in the state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> had access to that state's mainframe lottery computer,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> alleged <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> used a computer at his firm, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a copy of the unclaimed winning ticket, which he gave to <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> to cash in. He contended <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> obtained some security codes and other information about the winning ticket from the lottery's main computer, which he had access to as a troubleshooter. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> was responsible for troubleshooting the lotterry's main computer. Spokesmen at <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they had been told by the state <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to comment. And Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said late in the day that he had postponed final approval of a proposed contract renewal for <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> pending review of security safeguards. When <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> claimed the jackpot Thursday, he said he had been using the ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeing a newspaper story about the unclaimed prize. <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON>, associate editor of Gaming and <ORGANIZATION> Wagering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said security violations in lottery games are rare because of the precautions. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON>, the lottery's executive director, said some of his colleagues had doubts about the ticket even before <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> received his check. The doubts centered on the finding that the bogus ticket was printed on a blank from a <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> lottery-ticket outlet, while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said he decided to award the prize because past discrepancies of that type were explained by merchants lending blank tickets to other sellers. Less than an hour after <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> left a news conference, however, the officials decided the ticket was n't real and contacted <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>. Later that day, the <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the lottery, asked <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>'s bank to stop payment on the check and state prosecutors asked the bank to stall <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> if he tried to withdraw the money. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> was `` not unlike any other big winner I'd ever seen He was very nervous.'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said agents from his office confronted <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> on Sunday, and <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> admitted he knew the ticket was not genuine. According to an affidavit used to obtain arrest warrants, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> also told the agents <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> was expecting $ 5,000 from him Monday. On Monday night, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> $ 5,000 provided to him by investigators. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> was armed and tried to flee when agents moved in, but was captured without incident, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said additional security measures, which he refused to disclose, would have eventually uncovered the forgery. This is the second fixing case to plague the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Lottery. The April 24, 1980, drawing of the Daily Number was fixed by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits. The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, also resulted in tighter security for the televised drawings. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said new procedures would also be implemented because of the new case.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Impose Transport Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas on Tuesday imposed a nationwide road transport ban that forced workers to walk to their jobs or pay high fares to truck drivers. The ban, the third this year, reduced traffic on intercity roads and highways by up to 90 percent, according to several dispatchers and broadcast reports from the provinces. City traffic appeared to be about a third of that on a normal day. Only two privately owned city buses were seen in a tour of the capital and the surrounding area. Several state-owned buses with soldiers aboard for protection were providing transport, as were some army trucks. But most Salvadorans either walked or boarded overcrowded pickups and vans converted to public transport by their owners. The drivers charged an average of two colones -LRB- 40 cents -RRB- per trip, or about six times the average bus fare. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who have waged an 8-year campaign against the U.S.-backed government, warned drivers to heed the measure. They did not say how long it would last. On the clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, the rebels said they were taking down license plate numbers of vehicles violating the ban and would retaliate with sabotage. The guerrillas said the ban was a response to increased repression by security forces. Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said a taxi was commandeered then burned Tuesday morning by urban commandos in northeastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. During transport bans in February and March, four people died, 11 were wounded and 15 vehicles were burned or shot. As was the case during the previous bans, the guerrillas on Tuesday stepped up their sabotage against the state-owned electric utility. Bombs toppled several utility posts or transmission towers, cutting electricity to wide swatches of this nation of 5 million. Gen. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, said all leaves for members of the 56,000-strong armed forces had been canceled to provide security along the nation's thoroughfares. Several citizens condemned the transport ban. `` The ones most hurt are the humble people who use public transport,'' said a middle-aged man who refused to give his name for fear of the guerrillas.

 There's a world of difference between riding a thoroughbred horse and driving a car, but there is also one similarity: Let either one get out of control and you have a problem. `` These horses are a little bit crazy,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, a former history teacher who is owner of <ORGANIZATION> Hawkeye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Students who have had a horse run off with them say it's like being in a Formula One race car with the throttle stuck open, very little steering and no brakes.'' About 70 percent of those in the <LOCATION> Hawkeye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> riding program wash out because they ca n't master the powerful, high-spirited animals from the saddle. But since they also study stable management before planting their feet in the stirrups, employment after graduation usually is n't a problem. The school has a 40-page list of stables looking for help. `` These are people who write or call in orders and say, ` I need a groom or an exercise rider,' `` said the 43-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, who started the school in 1979. The 68-acre complex has two training tracks, barns, a dormitory and a classroom. Ten groups of 12 students per year take a home correspondence course before arriving for the minimum one-month course in exercise riding _ how to give racehorses their workouts _ that many students hope will lead up the ladder to a jockey's life. The state-accredited campus is an alternative to the traditional school for jockeys: the school of hard knocks. People wanting to become jockeys usually are handed a pitchfork instead of the reins and have to work their way up. `` Unless you have good connections such as parents who are trainers or who are wealthy horse owners, it's very hard to get a job at the track,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said. `` So this gives them a good foundation of hands-on experience with thoroughbred race horses.'' <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopp </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Kahoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, graduated from the school in March and was back this week to prepare for his test to get an apprentice jockey license. `` I was getting run away with quite a bit, and now I feel I can ride about anything out there ...,'' said <PERSON> Hopp </PERSON>, whose family owns thoroughbreds. `` There was my way of riding and their way or riding, and theirs was better.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the program would help her train the thoroughbreds she owns at her farm near <LOCATION> Carlisle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Unlike most of the students, who are in their late teens or 20s, Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has several grown children. Summer and fall are the busiest times at the school 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, but business picks up around <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> time. This year's <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Derby </ORGANIZATION> is set for Saturday. `` Many of the foreign students come especially for the <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said. `` They come from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They've also come from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. They're wanting to learn about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ways of training race horses and riding, and about American racetracks.'' The school has 50 horses graded in riding difficulty from `` the ones you could put your grandma on, to the real hair-raising horses,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said. The only thing harder to handle than an out-of-control horse might be a class of junior high school students, the former teacher said. `` Get you about 30 of them and put -LRB- the students -RRB- in a situation where they do n't want to be,'' she said. `` After that, thoroughbreds are a challenge, but a pleasure.''

<HEAD>More Cities Failed to Meet Ozone Standards Last Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More areas have failed to meet federal clean air standards for ozone, a major component of smog, but carbon monoxide pollution has cleared up slightly, the <ORGANIZATION> Evironmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual list of areas violating national clean air standards for the two pollutants shows 68 cities not meeting the ozone goals last year, an increase of six from the year before, and 59 out of compliance for carbon monoxide, a decrease of six. Twenty cities appeared on both lists, so 107 cities and rural areas containing 135 million people, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, violate one standard or both. The 24 largest metropolitan areas were on one or both lists, leaving <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the largest area in compliance. Both pollutants are influenced by the weather, and for that reason <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> uses more than a year's data in judging compliance _ three years for ozone and two years for carbon monoxide. The ozone tabulations cover the years 1985-87 and the carbon monoxide 1986-87. If, for example, only 1986 data had been used, 50 cities would have flunked the carbon monoxide test. If 1987 readings alone had been used, 37 cities would have failed. But to be in compliance, a city must make the cut both years. The influence of weather on ozone is more pronounced. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, are listed as violators this year, but not last year. All four were on the 1986 list using 1983-1985 data. The relevant ozone readings for those four areas for 1985-1987 are similar to those for 1983-1985, possibly because their summers were similar in 1983 and 1987, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. `` We had a hot, dry summer in the East, which tends to push up ozone levels,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. `` It was much like the summer of 1983, except confined to the East.'' This year's lists are perhaps more important than most because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will use them in deciding if and how to revise the Clean Air Act. While revisions are being considered, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from imposing penalties on any non-complying areas before Aug. 31. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> contends that it may not impose penalties for sheer failure to meet numerical standards, but must do so for areas that fail to work toward compliance. Penalties for at least 14 areas were held up by the congressional action. Those penalties can be the suspension of federal highway, sewer and air pollution program aid. Aug. 31 is now the deadline for complying with the standards, which no one expects or believes possible for many cities. Various proposals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would extend the deadlines according to the severity of pollution and efforts needed to clean it up. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, sponsor of one bill that has cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement the new report `` demonstrates that the ozone nonattainment problem continues to worsen'' and that his bill is needed. He was echoed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a grouping of environmental and other organizations, who said the new data `` confirm that we are no longer winning the battle against air pollution and we need a revitalized Clean Air Act.'' Carbon monoxide interferes with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Ozone, the major component of smog, worsens breathing problems. Motor vehicles are involved in producing both pollutants. Carbon monoxide is emitted directly in the exhaust. As cars built before 1981, when the latest emission standards took effect, are retired, urban air should get cleaner regardless of the weather. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says average carbon monoxide concentrations have been improving by about 4 percent a year since the mid-1970s. The agency expects all but a handful of cities _ four to six, according to <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> _ eventually to meet clean air standards for carbon monoxide without special effort. Ozone compliance is more difficult, in part because it is not emitted in exhaust. Ozone is formed by chemical reactions in sunlight between oxides of nitrogen _ still another pollutant emitted by all fossil fuel combustion, including vehicle fuels _ and volatile compounds like gasoline vapor, both from tailpipes and from normal evaporation in fuel systems. These reactions can proceed downwind of the source of the raw materials, which accounts for the presence of several rural counties, five of them in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on the ozone non-compliance list. Ozone raw materials for the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> counties were emitted somewhere upwind in the <LOCATION> Boston-Washington </LOCATION> corridor. Though many areas will improve as old cars are junked, far more will remain out of compliance than will be true for carbon monoxide, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes. Some 25 or more cities will be unable to comply with tighter controls on stationary sources of other, non-gasoline compounds like solvents, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says. By a wide margin, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area is again worst for ozone pollution, in part because of the mountains around the city that keep polluted air from moving away. The area has peak ozone concentrations nearly three times the standard and an estimated 143 days of violation per year. The second worst city is <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with peaks 50 percent above the standard and 35 days of violations per year. Four other <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities _ <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> _ have more than 10 days above the standard. Outside of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, only <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> have more than 10 days of violation per year.

<HEAD>Networks Looking Making Peace With Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of competitive feuding with cable television, the broadcast networks and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> are looking at the rapidly growing medium as an opportunity rather than an enemy. As part of that trend, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> broke into the cable industry Monday by buying a cable channel to produce business and sports programs. Long the poor cousin of broadcast television, cable has grown into a $ 12 billion a year industry that is steadily siphoning viewers from the networks and cutting into <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s profits. Now, the broadcast networks are looking at cable as a way to reclaim some of that audience with their existing resources _ like <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> with its news and sports operations. And <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is seeing in cable a new source of programming revenue and a place where producers can work more creatively. `` We've been waiting 20 years for this,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cable company which is buying <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based <ORGANIZATION> Tempo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> a part of Tempo, a cable outlet carried on systems with 12 million subscribers NBC President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the move was `` an important step in our efforts to broaden <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s business base.'' He said that while helping the cable industry, the venture will strengthen <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's top-rated broadcast network. <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, has already moved into cable. It owns 80 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network. With Hollywood as a backdrop, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention, which ended here Tuesday, provided a convenient opportunity for big-name movie producers like <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> to make a pitch to the nation's largest cable companies. `` They view cable as the thing of the future,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cownie </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and chairman of the cable association. `` They look at cable as a hybrid of the little screen and the big screen, and something that is not restricted editorially or with time constraints.'' At the request of <ORGANIZATION> MCA-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, whose company owns <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cownie </PERSON> organized a group of executives from the country's 30 largest cable companies to talk with <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, `` Miami Vice'' executive producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and other producers about a joint programming venture. `` We have n't given them specific ideas yet,'' <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> after the closed-door meeting Sunday. `` But this was to let them know we would like to get in on the new frontier.'' The convention also provided further evidence of broadcast companies' interest in cable TV, with the presence of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. Both had booths on the convention floor. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> is proposing ways cable and broadcast can work in cooperative promotional ventures, and public TV stations have a vital interest in being carried by cable systems as more Americans are added to cable systems. More than half the nation's approximately 90 million TV households subscribe to cable, and more than 80 percent of households are wired for it. Speaking to financial analysts Monday, <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said he was `` thrilled'' that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers are interested in the opportunities cable offers. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said producers `` are finding out that cable offers a new dimension for them to be creative, to try things.'' He said that while the cable industry does n't have nearly the broadcast networks' programming budgets _ more than $ 1 billion each _ cable can offer other things the networks can not, like editorial freedom. `` I think you're going to see a lot of big stars willing to do work -LRB- at lower cost -RRB- because they've got a message,'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. And cable, financed mostly by subscribers rather than advertising, is better able than the broadcast networks to run programs that are n't big ratings producers, he said. `` We have the staying power to deal with smaller audiences,'' he said. `` The networks ca n't afford to give up'' any share of the audience they reach because of the impact that has on ad revenues.

<HEAD>Democrats Move to Erase Alaska Oil Curbs in Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats moved to erase the trade bill's curbs on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil exports Tuesday even before the measure reached President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk and a threatened presidential veto House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the move was designed to offer <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a compromise and thus perhaps avert a veto of the 1,000-page bill which won final approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week. Republicans countered that the real reason was to win over the votes of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators for a veto override. The move to drop the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provision was contained in a resolution authorizing technical corrections in the bill. The bill cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week by a vote of 63-36 last week _ three short of the number needed to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threatened veto The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the resolution this week and senators will deal with it next week when they return from a recess. One of the curbs would enable <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to export 50,000 barrels of crude a day to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but would require that the oil be transported to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> port first in American vessels. The provision is a favorite of politically influential maritime unions, and a similar feature is contained in the current U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. The other provision would limit exports from new refineries to 70,000 barrels a day and half of total production. At a news conference, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> portrayed the move as designed to keep the trade bill from going down the drain through a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. The president has been concerned about a provision that would require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. But more recently he has also reportedly found fault with the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions. `` We're trying to meet him -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- halfway if we can,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters. `` ... We're trying in every way to appeal to his better nature.'' Before the plan won committee approval, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., described it as `` a ploy to change some votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in order to override a possible presidential veto. `` I do n't think this committee ought to be used for this purpose,'' <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, voted against the trade bill because of its resrictions on oil exports. Democrats believed that they would have supported the measure had the curbs been dropped. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said at one point, however, that he could not guarantee support for the bill even if the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions were stripped out. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., took the floor earlier and accused <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of trying to `` win at all costs. `` I am told there is a proposed new rule in the works that will allow the majority to delete the Alaskan oil provisions in a last-ditch attempt to manipulate a veto override in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` Is there nothing left of the integrity of our rules and procedures?'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` Good policy is the product of good legislation produced honestly and openly in a deliberative manner.''

 Panamanian officials have told opposition party leaders that military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is considering stepping down as defense chief on Aug. 12, an opposition spokesman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also quoted President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as saying that an agreement on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political future may be signed this week. <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said the Aug. 12 departure date for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under consideration because that is the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials refused to discuss <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>'s comments, noting that a government-wide news blackout on the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> issue has been imposed But <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political future has been the subject of continuing negotiations between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and a variety of Panamanians, both in and out of government. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> met Tuesday with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a leader of the anti-Noriega forces in exile. There was no report on the meeting. <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, a leader of another group opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, spoke to reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The administration, in a policy shift, said last week it is no longer insisting that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and would settle for his resignation as defense chief as a prelude to a transition to democratic rule. Word of the policy shift has angered the Panamanian opposition, which maintains that the country's political future is for Panamanians to decide, not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has no right to decide if a Panamanian can stay or not in the country,'' <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be able to maintain control in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if he stays in the country even without a formal title. Any agreement allowing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to remain on would mean `` treason against the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` We are completely convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a murderer, we are completely convinced he is involved in drugs,'' <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-smuggling charges.

 A homemade bomb was discovered Tuesday at a British army base and detonated by explosives experts, a military spokesman said. Col. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, said the two-pound bomb was attached to a car in a civilian parking lot at the base, located near the north-central town of <LOCATION> Bielefeld </LOCATION>. No one claimed responsibility for planting the bomb. On Sunday, three off-duty British airmen were killed in bombing and shooting attacks in the Dutch towns of <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nieuwbergen </LOCATION>. Those assaults were claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the explosives were found Tuesday by a soldier during a routine afternoon inspection and that experts blew up the bomb.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday he will go to an Orthodox monastery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during his summit visit despite a Ukrainian Catholic leader's plea that he cancel the event as a sign of support for religious freedom. `` He said he already made plans and he has to go,'' Myroslav Cardinal <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> told reporters after meeting privately with the president at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and declaring that Ukrainian Catholics continue to suffer persecution. The cardinal added that the president promised to `` be firm about the issues'' of religious freedom in his discussions with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Being there, he will mention that freedom of the churches is necessary for all the people,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also pledged to try to meet with Ukrainian Catholic leaders while in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> May 29 to June 2. Addressing a White House conference on religious rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> just before his meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the cardinal said that `` the age of suffering has not passed'' for Christians in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Today, we hear so much about glasnost and perestroika,'' he said. `` But, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have yet to touch the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Our priests are punished or fined for celebrating the liturgy in private homes, and the faithful live in constant fear of imprisonment. Such violations of basic human rights simply must not exist. `` Therefore, in the name of all that is sacred, I implore you ... to advise the president to reconsider his trip to the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery at this time,'' he said. `` The symbolism of this event would lend credence to the atheistic Kremlin's usurping of the 1,000-year-old Ukrainian Christian legacy.'' The monastery on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the central building of which is more than 700 years old, is being restored with government financial help. The building is noted for splendid religious decoration of gold and jewels. The cardinal also said he urged the president to meet with Ukrainian religious leaders of the underground church during his trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` as a public manifestation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the resurrection of our banned Ukrainian churches.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his speech at the conference, said, `` I promise you that the witness of faith you brought here today will not be confined to these four walls or forgotten when this meeting is ended. `` I will carry it in my heart when I travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the end of this month and I will say that the most fitting way to mark the millenium of Christianity in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> ... would be granting the rights of all the peoples and all the creeds of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to worship their god in their own way.'' While noting the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said, `` The rights of Soviet Jews have taken up much of our official time and this is very close to my heart Our hope is for doors to open completely to emigration and to full freedom for all faiths.''

 Three engines on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet lost power over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> because three of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's fuel tanks ran dry, aviation sources said Tuesday The huge jetliner with 258 passengers and crew aboard landed safely at the <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on only one engine Monday after its flight from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. No one was injured. As the plane cruised at 39,000 feet, the pilot reported losing the first engine 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport, the second 30 minutes later and the third just before landing at the airport 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the three engines lost power, but a spokesman for the airline declined to speculate on what caused the power loss because the investigation has yet to be completed. `` The airplane has been thoroughly inspected. We have not found a mechanical problem ... At this point the plane is airworthy,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said the aircraft was being flown from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance facility at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for further examination. During the Monday flight, the pilot of the jumbo jet had told the airport control tower that he had shut two engines down because of a `` malfunction'' and asked for clearance for an expedited landing. Later another engine lost power. But aviation sources familiar with the incident said Tuesday that the power loss has been traced to three empty fuel tanks feeding the three engines. It was not certain whether the tanks ran dry because of a mechanical problem or because of an error by the flight crew. When the plane landed, investigators found about 20,000 pounds of fuel in the tank feeding the engine that was still operating, said industry and government sources who spoke on condition they not be identified further. The incident is being investigated by Japanese authorities, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air safety investigators also are interested in the case. <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said staffers plan to talk to crew members when they return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds, fuel is routinely transfered among its four wing tanks so that the plane maintains proper balance during a long trans-Pacific flight, aviation sources said. According to the manufacturer, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-100 of the type involved in the incident burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel an hour. `` Each of the four engines is independent and has its own fuel lines drawing from the tanks in the wing,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` You can interchange fuel from tank to tank.'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> would not speculate how three of the four tanks aboard Flight 97 would have run out of fuel, while more than 20,000 pounds of fuel remained in the fourth tank. Had that amount of fuel been evenly distributed the jumbo jet would have had no problems flying to its destination, one aviation source suggested. Industry sources said it is possible that a fuel line or filter became clogged or a valve failed to open preventing the fuel from shifting properly. Another possibility is that the flight crew shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank and was unable to transfer it back to the other tanks. Normally, the flight engineer in the three-person cockpit has the responsibility of keep track of the fuel loads and transfering fuel from tank to tank as necessary to keep proper aircraft balance. In newer <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s the fuel transfer is conducted automatically by the aircrafts' computerized flight system, but in most older planes such as the 747-100 series the shifting of fuel is conducted manually, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said she did not know specifically whether the fuel transfer was manual or automatic aboard the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jet. The aircraft has a variety of gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been burned, fuel remaining and the fuel flow rates for each tank, she said.

<HEAD>Doctors Find Details of Hormone-Related Gene</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have identified details of a key part of a gene responsible for male sexual development, a step that could eventually help doctors treat prostate cancer and diagnose infertility in men. The gene allows body cells to create surface structures called receptors, to which male sex hormones attach themselves. That binding triggers sex-related functions in the cells, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, head of the laboratories of reproductive biology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` It's like a switch,'' French said. `` When the switch is turned on, it causes genes to stimulate certain characteristic functions of the cell.'' The work, reported last month in the journal Science, was carried out by French and colleagues at the university. The finding is `` a very major discovery _ it's like getting the rest of the words to ` Hamlet','' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, director of research at the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s prostate cancer program. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> researchers used the information to create special proteins called antibodies, which detected the presence of the sex hormone receptors in laboratory animals. A test based on these antibodies may one day help doctors choose proper therapy for prostate cancer, French said. The test, called an androgen receptor assay, would tell whether prostate cells still have the receptor on their surfaces. The receptor disappears in advanced cases of prostate cancer, French said. Once the receptor is gone, hormone therapy to fight inoperable prostate cancer would be useless, said <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>. `` We'll know not to waste time with hormone therapy if it's not going to work,'' <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. An estimated 96,000 men get it each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and 27,000 die from it, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The receptor test also may ultimately prove helpful in determining the cause of infertility in some men, French said. Without the receptor, a man would appear female because his cells would not respond to male sex hormone, French said. However, in some men, the receptor is present but its binding ability is impaired _ resulting in normal development but infertility.

 Soldiers shot three Palestinians to death Tuesday during anti-occupation rioting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Israeli police raided a prominent Arab daily newspaper and arrested its managing editor. Three Arabs were reported wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where rebellion against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8. At least 180 Palestinians have been killed, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler have been slain. The Israelis have closed two Arab newspapers and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> news agency in the five months and arrested 22 reporters, both Arabs and Israelis, who sympathize with the Palestinians. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> tanks pushed to within a few miles of Syrian positions, reinforcing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers who searched the rugged hills for Palestinian guerrillas in an operation that began Monday night. Syrian forces went on full alert. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the Israeli forces would not remain in the area long or provoke the Syrians. `` There's totally no danger of entanglement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said later in northern <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> that the operation was not aimed at expanding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone,'' a six - to 10-mile-wide strip in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rival in the coalition government, said the operation was within `` the routine framework of preventing infiltrations into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> toured south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and later indicated the push will continue at least until Wednesday evening. He said other incursions may follow _ `` any time we shall find it necessary ... -LRB- because of -RRB- terror from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops were `` tens of kilometers'' from the main Syrian army positions. A kilometer is slightly more than six-tenths of a mile. Col. <PERSON> Ranaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman, said the Syrians understood the action posed no threat to them. The operation against Palestinian bases in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> came after weeks of guerrilla raids into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including two last week. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> because the guerrillas came from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which the Syrian army controls. Protesters burned tires and hurled stones at soldiers Tuesday in <LOCATION> Beni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village two miles east of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, and the troopers opened fire, killing two, the army reported. Soldiers also shot and killed a Palestinian rioter in the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and officials at <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports identified him as <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifki </PERSON> <PERSON> Amiza </PERSON>, 23.

He said about 5,000 villagers waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and black flags of mourning at a funeral for the two young men, chanting: `` With our body and soul we will redeem you, Palestine!'' and `` Palestine is Arab!'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION>, said plainclothes and riot police entered its offices in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Monday night, arrested managing editor <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> and took the names of other employees. Security forces confirmed the raid and said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> would be jailed for six months without trial under emergency regulations. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I feel all these oppressive measures will backlash against the peace process. Journalists apparently are being singled out for special attention.'' He said it was not clear why <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON>, managing editor for six years, was detained. Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> mounted a commercial strike, following instructions in an underground leaflet issued Friday. The army said it put four refugee camps under curfew. An army report said soldiers shot and wounded an 18-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> who tried to keep workers from traveling to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Another was wounded by Israeli gunfire at a protest in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and soldiers wounded a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> during a clash in <LOCATION> Ajul </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said.

<TEXT>
 A prominent writer said Tuesday the Soviets are still blaming the devastation of World War II for their poor performance in agriculture and industry, while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have rebuilt and prospered. <PERSON> Chingiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON> wrote in the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has fared worse than the vanquished nations in postwar economic recovery. He said dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> began the practice of ignoring the real causes of slow development and blaming it on the war. More than 20 million Soviet citizens died in the war and about one-quarter of the housing and industry in the European part of the country was destroyed. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> launched a rebuilding campaign that replaced many factories wrecked in the war, but housing remains a serious problem and farms still fail to produce enough food for the country. `` Sometimes it is necessary to compare how quickly and powerfully has been the economic rebirth of the capitulated nations <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which were brought to ruins, thoroughly destroyed, dismantled to the last nut,'' <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON> wrote. He said Soviet officials also remain reluctant to credit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for their help in winning the war. <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON> specifically mentioned nearly 15,000 warplanes provided to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON> is a severe critic of totalitarianism and the dehumanizing influences of Stalinism. He condemned the collectivization of the 1930s that removed peasants from the land and noted that, half a century later, the government must buy grain abroad. Soviet planners should take a lesson from reforms carried out in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where `` no one is particularly sad about the failure of communes,'' he said. <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON>'s point seemed to be that more family farms would improve output. Embracing the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said more democracy and openness were the only hope for a better future.

<HEAD>Authorities Now Processing Exit Applications `Reasonably Fast'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet authorities are now processing emigration applications `` reasonably fast'' and Jews who wish to leave should take advantage of the opportunity in case the situation changes, a high-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, also said he saw some signs of growing religious toleration in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, in remarks to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, said he believed a huge percentage of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s two million Jews would emigrate if given the chance. Most have not applied, knowing they would be subject to discrimination in employment and other opportunities during the long _ often unending _ period while waiting for approval. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said, however, `` It looks as if a good many people could get their cases processed reasonably fast if they were to apply right now. They're afraid and they're afraid quite rightfully because anything can turn in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with a very short time and they can find themselves in great difficulty after that. `` A good many of them also are not fully aware today of what the possibilities are: that you can indeed fill out the forms, get them filed and there's a chance within six weeks or two months perhaps to get your application processed,'' he said. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said Soviet Jews should be assured `` that the possibilities are there now and they ought to take advantage of it if this is what they want to do.'' After reaching a high point of 51,320 exit permits in 1979, Soviet emigration declined to 914 in 1986. It rebounded to 8,155 in 1987 and will go even higher this year if the monthly figures hold up. In March, for example, 986 Jews emigrated, the highest monthly total since 1981, according to the Conference on Soviet Jewry. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been urging the Soviets to allow freer emigration and religious freedom. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said a pledge by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week to show more tolerance toward religion represented `` somewhat of an opening.'' He also said it appeared that for the past half year the Soviets have not enforced laws prohibiting adult Jewish education classes. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> expressed some optimism that the Soviets will permit the importation of bibles. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> did not appear particularly concerned about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s condemnation, during a visit by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> last month, of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's continued criticism of Soviet human rights practices `` He gets annoyed about these things,'' <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` He is a person who has a short fuse on matters of this kind. But the fact of the matter is that they are moving in this area.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to continue raising the issues when he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the May 29-June 2 summit. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the Soviet Jewry conference that during his visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in April, he raised several human rights concerns, but concentrated on Jewish emigration. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking improvements on five aspects of the issue: _ Processing time `` There are too many bureaucratic delays,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of the application process. `` While they ca n't admit it they -LRB- Soviet leaders -RRB- see it as a real problem.'' _ Applications denied for security reasons Many Jews' applications are rejected on grounds they hold state secrets, even those who have n't worked in defense plants for decades There's been no movement from the Soviets on this, `` but at least the problem is up there on the table,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said _ Family restrictions The Soviets deny applications to those who do not have close relatives in the West, a practice that violates human rights accords the Soviets have signed, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. _ Ill applicants The Soviets should loosen up on applications from people seeking medical care elsewhere, the secretary said. _ Parental veto Under Soviet law, the parents of an applicant can veto the granting of a permit, even if the child is an adult. `` They're looking into it,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 East German Jews on Tuesday accused their departing American rabbi of high living and improper performance of duties and said they were looking for another man to become the communist nation's only rabbi. One local Jew, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some community members had begun calling <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> `` the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> rabbi.'' Numerous telephone calls to <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>'s home were unanswered Tuesday. However, <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said on Sunday that such issues as his apartment and car were not part of the tensions that prompted him to decide to leave. A statement from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jewish community, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency, responded to criticisms made by <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> when he announced last weekend he was leaving May 16 after only eight months. The 65-year-old rabbi from <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, had complained of what he called anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and interference in his work from local Jewish leadership. Tuesday's statement from local Jewish leaders said, `` His current assertion that anti-Semitic tendencies in the press ... have caused his return were never raised in his discussions with the community.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> officially maintains it has wiped out anti-Semitism in its nearly four decades of existence. The statement also charged <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> with improperly carrying out some of his duties, such as dealing with the elderly and preparing youths for Bar Mitzvah. The Polish-born <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, a Nazi prisoner during World War II, in September became the first rabbi in 21 years for this nation's Jewish community of about 450 people There was no official word on a replacement for <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>. Community members who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> would be succeeded by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Rabbi <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>. Others sources close to the community said <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON> would be appointed only on an interim basis, while a young rabbi was sought as a permanent replacement. <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>, 71, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> he had received no official invitation to come to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` If I do, I would have to think about it,'' he said. He said he did not want to stay in East Germay year-round but might accept a short-term arrangement. <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fleeing Nazi persecution in 1936. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, explaining his reasons for leaving in an interview Tuesday, said, `` I am unhappy about <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and anti-Semitism.'' He criticized the East German news media's depiction of Palestinian unrest in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes the way <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is depicted is in a Nazi-like fashion,'' he said. `` They have cut anti-Semitism but have not succeeded in uprooting it.'' He also complained about interference in his work. His main objections focused on the local Jewish community president, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON>, who signed the statement distributed Tuesday by the East German news agency. `` The assertion that Rabbi <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> was hindered in carrying out his functions by members, or the community representatives, or other people must be rejected with emphasis,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jewish community members, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there had long been criticism of <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> and his lifestyle. `` He would drive to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> every day to get fresh tomatoes,'' said one local Jew. Community members said <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> was provided with a large apartment and a car during his tenure. The community supported <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> with funds provided by the government. The East German Jewish community includes less than 350 officially registered members and about 100 other worshipers, <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said. However, some estimates say that there are as many as 2,500 non-practicing Jews in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 A congressional critic of nuclear power urged the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to reject a staff proposal that would permit atomic reactors to operate at low power without an alarm system to warn nearby residents in case of an emergency. The recommendation, scheduled for a preliminary commission vote shortly, is aimed at the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, plant. The Atomic Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has blocked a low-power license for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> because of the lack of a warning system for neighboring communities in nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` During fuel loading and low-power operation, the potential for an accident still exists, including the possibility of a reactor reaching a critical level,'' Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` While the magnitude of the risk may be lower -LRB- than at full power -RRB-, it is no lower than it was in 1982 when the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> examined the issue in detail and adopted existing standards,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> wrote Critics say <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> officials want to quickly secure a low-power license because they fear they will lose their chance to operate the $ 5.4 billion plant if <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has led the fight against <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> and his refusal to cooperate in emergency evacuation planning for the six <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> municipalities has delayed the licensing process. `` It's clear that they're trying to push this through because they do n't know what the future holds for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwit </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> said the commission was expected to vote soon on whether to make the recommendation a `` proposed rule.'' That would be subject to a public comment period, but not necessarily a hearing, and a final commission vote, <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials say the current rules do not specifically require an off-site warning system to obtain a low-power license, and that the rules change would only `` clarify'' the regulations. But a 1982 commission `` explanation'' of the rule does specify an off-site system, and that clearly has been the interpretation of the licensing appeals board. The board ruled in February that a low-power license for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> `` is precluded unless and until the applicants have submitted substitute public notification plans for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities'' within the emergency zone. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has proposed an alternate alert system that would use truck-mounted sirens, backed up by siren-equipped helicopters, according to plant spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials plan to use that system during low-power operation, but with the rules change would not need to wait for regulatory approval of the system. Approval would be needed eventually for a full-power license.

<HEAD>Court Of Appeals Reinstates Lawsuit Against Tobacco Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A widow whose husband smoked and died of lung cancer can pursue a wrongful death lawsuit against a tobacco company and a retailer that sold cigarettes, the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday. A three-judge panel unanimously overturned a district court ruling in May 1987 that <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s claim was pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette and Advertising Act. In March 1985, Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, sued <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturers of Camel cigarettes, and <ORGANIZATION> Erickson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. The Forsters claimed the retailer sold <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> the cigarettes. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, who was diagnosed as having inoperable lung cancer in November 1984, died of the disease in June 1985, and the suit, originally filed as a product liability case, was amended to a wrongful death action. The lawsuit alleges that cigarettes caused the lung cancer. Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalitowski </PERSON>, who wrote the majority opinion, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> historically has taken a narrow view of federal pre-emption. In overturning the lower court, <PERSON> Kalitowski </PERSON> said: `` Our holding is founded on the strong presumption, basic to our system of federalism, that state police powers are not superseded by federal actions'' without `` clear and unmistakable congressional intent or absolute necessity.'' `` We recognize appellants' claims may be difficult to prove,'' the ruling said. `` However, the difficulty of proof should not preclude the basic right to present claims.''

<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to maintain at least 20 missile-firing submarines as part of any U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut back strategic nuclear weapons. The voice-vote decision came as the chamber adopted an amendment to a bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Both nations are now negotiating to achieve a Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -LRB- START -RRB- treaty that could provide reductions of up to 50 percent in each country's stockpile of long-range atomic weapons. Those stockpiles are made up of submarine-launched missiles, land-based missiles and bombers. Under the proposed treaty, both sides would be required to reduce and restructure their arsenals. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has more than half its strategic firepower aboard 36 missile-firing subs, including 28 Poseidon-class boats and eight of the giant Trident-class subs. Seven more Tridents are under construction, while a 16th is authorized in the bill now on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has n't yet decided how to restack its stockpile under a START treaty, but the amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said at least 20 submarines should be retained. `` Our ability to prevent nuclear war depends more than anything else on the maintenance of a survivable nuclear deterrent,'' said <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, who added that subs are virtually invulnerable to attack while they are at sea. `` It is in our interest to have the maximum number of submarines possible,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. As it worked through the bill, the chamber also gave voice vote approval to an amendment banning the sending of any <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels to help the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Supporters of the amendment had said a day earlier they planned to drop the proposal in the wake of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announcement that the deployment plan was being shelved. But as the issue arose Tuesday, a procedural snare meant it was easier to simply approve the amendment than to bypass it. In another decision, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 213-195 to give federal contractors more freedom to set pay scales. The vote approved an amendment overhauling the Davis-Bacon Act, the 1931 law which requires that employees covered by contracts on federal jobs worth more than $ 2,000 should be paid the prevailing local wage rate, a figure determined by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The rate is commonly the same rate paid union workers. The measure approved Tuesday would raise the threshold figure from $ 2,000 to $ 50,000. The vote came shortly before the chamber rejected, 210-204, a move that would have raised the Davis-Bacon threshold from $ 2,000 to $ 250,000. The Davis-Bacon law was enacted during the Great Depression amid worries that construction companies would hire cheap labor. Tuesday's votes on the bill went generally along party lines, with <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> backing the $ 50,000 threshold and Republicans supporting the $ 250,000 threshold. There have been a number of attempts during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to change the law by critics who contend that the $ 2,000 figure is outdated. Organized labor has strongly supported the Davis-Bacon law. The amendment approved Tuesday was essentially the same measure passed last Aug. 4 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. That bill has n't yet come to the floor, but committee leaders said they offered it as an amendment to the Pentagon budget bill in an effort to forestall the amendment proposing a $ 250,000 threshold. Neither the START nor the Davis-Bacon amendments adopted Tuesday is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be considering next week. Differences between the measures that eventually pass each chamber will be worked out in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. Both measures authorize $ 299.5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for the next fiscal year.

 Scientists expressed dismay Tuesday that some White House decisions might have been based on astrology, with one saying, `` That's not the type of guidance we need from the federal government.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, an astronomy professor at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, said that the claims of astrology have been subjected to dozens of scientific tests and have been found totally without foundation. In one test, he said, two scientists examined more than 3,000 predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct less than 10 percent of the time. `` If the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time, that's not the type of guidance we need from the federal government,'' <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office Meanwhile, an organization of scientists called the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal said in a statement: `` We are dismayed by reports that the White House has consulted astrologists. We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval superstitition. Dozens of tests in recent years by scientists can find little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting future events.'' The committee also asked the White House `` to confirm to what extent astrologers have been advisers of presidents. The public has the right to know who these astrologers are and what recommendations they have made. We ask that their claims and alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny.'' The issue was raised by reports that former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote in an upcoming book that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted astrologers to determine the timing of presidential speeches and announcements. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that he has never based any policy or decision on astrological forecasts, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has consulted an astrologer to help schedule the president's activities. <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said modern astrology uses the positions of the Uranus and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in making predictions, and yet, these planets were not even discovered when the concept of astrology was established in ancient times. Furthermore, he said, the astrological predictions presumably are based on the alignment of planets against a background of the stars. Yet, since the astrology system was established in ancient times, the Earth's position has shifted slightly so that the constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing position. In effect, the signs of the Zodiac viewed now are not those seen by the ancients, he said. <PERSON> Franknoi </PERSON> said the concepts of astrology are based on the idea that the influence of the stars and planets have some effect on infants as they are born. Hence, the gravitational and tidal effect of Mars, for instance, are supposed to influence the life of a child, he said. But calculations by scientists show that the obstetrican who delivers a baby has a six times greater gravitational influence on a child than the planet Mars, <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said. And the tidal effect of the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion. `` Scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the public,'' said the statement from the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal. `` ... The intrusion of astrology into the highest levels of national security thinking now is a cause for further concern. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to continue its leadership in scientific research, it is vital that the public have a clear understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience, and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of prognostication,'' the statement said. The organization has hundreds of scientists as members, including such familiar names as <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON>.

Ms. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s office as press secretary just a week ago. She had worked there as press secretary and legislative assistant in 1985. While <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> did not attend a session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment offered by him to the defense authorization bill.

 A man convicted of murdering seven women and letting their bodies rot faces life in prison rather than death under an unusual sentence handed down Tuesday. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> issued six death sentences against <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> `` Marty'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> but ordered him first to serve up to 14 years in prison on seven counts of abuse of a corpse and life in prison for the remaining murder. Latrone, who ordered the sentences to run consecutively, explained that he chose life in prison over the death penalty on the first murder count because of a mitigating circumstance _ the lack of a previous record. But the conviction on the first count legally qualified as an aggravating circumstance on the second through seventh murder counts, necessitating the death penalty in those six cases. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> could not apply for parole during the life sentence, however, without putting the death sentence into effect, defense attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, whose attorney said he was mentally retarded, sat motionlessly through the sentencing, a half-smoked cigarette tucked behind his ear. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> called the sentence `` unusually compassionate and brilliant.'' But Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who characterized <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> as a `` serial killer'' during the trial, questioned the legality of the order. `` It would appear that the greater sentence would come first,'' he said, meaning the death penalty. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reviews all death sentences. Last week, Latrone convicted <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of seven counts of murder and abuse of a corpse. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> waived his right to a jury trial, leaving the decisions, including sentencing, solely to the judge. Police found the bodies of seven women in August 1987, after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench. Officers found six rotting bodies in <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s bedroom, leg and foot bones outside his apartment and a torso in a neighboring house's basement At his mother's urging, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> surrendered to police a week after the bodies were discovered. In a statement his lawyer unsuccessfully contested, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told police he strangled the women while having sex and after feeding them drugs and alcohol. He said that when the bodies began piling up in his apartment, he began experiencing trouble with `` fur-ball bugs,'' or maggots, and with birds feeding on the remains outside the window. The 28-year-old <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did not testify during the six-week trial. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON>, who had argued his client did not know right from wrong and might have killed the women accidentally or because of drug or alcohol use, said he would consult with <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s family before deciding whether to appeal.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a victory rally on Tuesday his clinching of the Republican presidential nomination was just a first step, while his son told campaign workers to `` go out and kick some <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> celebrated his mathematical lock on the nomination at an `` Over the Top'' party at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel. The vice president said surpassing the 1,139 delegates needed for nomination _ which he actually did in last week's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary _ `` wrapped this thing up sooner than I think any of us thought might take place.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was was expected to pick up another 132 delegates in Tuesday's winner-take-all <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` It all boiled down to working together,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his campaign staff and volunteer workers. `` And yet,'' he added, `` I do n't feel any finality to what has happened now at all. We've passed the first step, a tremendously important step ... But now we've got a long way to go.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, sharing the platform with his father, told the group: `` Our dad needs a real job.'' `` Sometimes sons can say things a father ca n't. We want you to go out there and kick some <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and kick him hard,'' he said. The younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks about the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner were a play on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s celebrated off-color gloat to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> longshoremen in which he characterized his performance in his 1984 debate with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. The vice president declared to rousing cheers that `` the party is united.'' `` I do n't believe there are any deep divisions in this party at all,'' he said. `` Let <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> go around here talking about pink slips, despair, pessimism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'll be the guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge.'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> told the gathering: `` Tonight we officially celebrate the fact that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be our nominee following the convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides earlier had said there was a possibility that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would attend the rally to formally voice his endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president was not in attendance. `` It never really jelled,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>. However, campaign and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides suggested that it was likely <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement would come soon, perhaps within the week. Campaigning earlier in <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that Americans have gotten `` a little fat, dumb and happy'' about the nation's energy needs and growing dependence on foreign oil At <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watched university scientists display a model of a `` circulating fluidized bed'' that eases the mining process by converting minerals to liquids. In his speech after leaving the research facility, he quipped, `` At one point, some guy was going into all this fluoride bed thing and the doctor said, ` Do you understand that?' and I said, ` Hell, no. The last thing I understood was when the guy said hello.' But it was impressive.'' Earlier, he said the acid rain problem that Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> recently discussed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made it even more urgent to find clean ways to burn coal. `` There's no way you can make an energy model for the future without coal as a very important part,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called his trip to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which has its primary next Tuesday, `` a relatively non-political visit,'' and avoided partisan remarks in his speech. Asked by reporters about barbs he has traded with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I found myself going back at him a little more than I wanted to.'' On picking a vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted someone loyal whom he could trust. When a reporter said that sounded like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself, he replied, `` That's just fine with me. And he ought to be prepared to take a helluva lot of flak for handling it that way.''

<HEAD>Contra Indians Surrender, Government Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 200 rebel Indians backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> surrendered their weapons and agreed to join the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> agreed to stop military actions against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and to `` not allow the presence of guerrilla groups in the territory.'' The Indians, like other Contra groups operating from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, had <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing and fought the leftist Sandinista government since 1981. Tens of thousands of Miskito, <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> and Sumo Indians left their tribal homelands beginning in 1981 after the government tried to impose Marxism in the area and said it would move them to relocation camps. Many Indians crossed the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> and sought refuge in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> rather than move to relocation camps. Thousands took up arms, creating rebel movements which, like the larger Nicaraguan Resistance, received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Most of the refugees have returned to their native 75-mile-long region along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> seaboard. The region is considered a national security area and foreigners are barred unless they have <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> permission. The Sandinistas some years ago acknowledged their errors with the Indians and sought their support. By March 1, nearly 7,000 had returned from Honduran refugee camps, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. The government has not been as successful with other Contra groups. A fragile interim truce has been in place since April 1 as Contras and <PERSON> Sadinista </PERSON> leaders negotiate a permanent peace accord.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city elections board voted unanimously Tuesday to hold a special mayoral election in spring 1989 to choose a successor to the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, whose term would have ended in 1991. `` We're proceeding with the 1989 election unless we're ordered to the contrary by the court,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>. The board had voted April 24 to hold a special mayoral election in April 1989 if City Clerk <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozubowski </PERSON> declared that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death in late November created a vacancy in the position. <PERSON> Kozubowski </PERSON> said at the time he would n't issue such a declaration unless ordered to do so by a court. But on Monday, he apparently changed his mind and provided the elections board with the documentation, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. `` The board decided to accept the declaration of a vacancy from the city clerk and decided to go ahead with the 1989 election unless we're ordered not to by the courts,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachowski </PERSON> said last week he expected to rule on the issue at a hearing Friday. Supporters of acting Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a rival and potential mayoral candidate, have been feuding over when the next mayoral election should be held. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> hailed Tuesday's decision as `` a great victory for all of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' `` We have never doubted that 1989 is the legally correct time for a special election,'' he said in a statement issued from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where he is attending a meeting of city finance officers. `` Now, however belatedly, the board of elections has heard the voices of the people and has followed the dictates of law. It is a great victory for all of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, one that is certain to be upheld by the courts,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Under the plan approved Tuesday, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said, a primary election would be held Feb. 28, followed by a general election April 4, 1989, that also would be used to choose a 6th Ward alderman to succeed acting Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was elected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s successor by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the city's first black mayor died of a heart attack in late November. Both sides filed lawsuits asking the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to decide the issue. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> forces have sought a 1989 special election, while <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s allies have been fighting for the 1991 election. `` Naturally, it's going to be fought out in the court,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said the elections board would not contest any court decision dictating when the next mayoral election should be held. `` We take a neutral position. We do n't fight anything,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Tuesday that police worldwide need to cooperate more closely because terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking have reached international dimensions. `` It is not unusual for a person to commit a crime and be half a world away in the next few hours,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told the fifth annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted that many local police cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be equipped with minicomputers with access to international computers. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> cited possible links between a fatal bombing outside a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the arrest of a Japanese man carrying pipe bombs on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators determined that the man, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, was `` a known member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a terrorist group whose members were blamed for detonating a car bomb on April 14 outside the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> USO club. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said such incidents require `` the highest level in the sharing of intelligence between governments.'' Italian officials issued arrest warrants for two fugitive members of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> bombing. The attack killed four Italians and an American servicewoman. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also told the law enforcenment officials from 60 countries that crime in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is climbing and that the spread and sale of drugs `` seems to be getting worse instead of better.'' Recalling his trip last month to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he flew over a coca field 75 miles wide and 200 miles long, proving the pervasive spread of cocaine production in the area. He said drug production now has `` a potential for undermining governments.'' Before the opening of the three-day meeting in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> met with Justice Minister <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassali </PERSON> to discuss improving extradition procedures between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to organize joint education programs for police and other law enforcement agencies. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he granted an Italian request to consider transferring an Italian convicted of subversion, <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON>, now in a high security prison in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to another facility currently under construction. Members of parliament have asked that her prison conditions be improved.

<HEAD>Toyota Announces Program to Fix Brake Pedal Pulsation in Camrys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that owners of about 380,000 Camrys are entitled to have a brake pedal pulsation problem repaired free. The voluntary recall, which is available to owners of 1983-1986 Camrys and certain early 1987 Camrys, is designed to correct a brake pedal pulsation problem that some owners have complained about, said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Brake pedal pulsation can be felt by drivers when their foot is on the pedal, but it does not affect braking effectiveness or steering control, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. Brake pedal pulsation is caused by movement of the brake pads as they pass over the brake disc, she said. Later this month, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> plans to notify owners of the cars in phases based on model years. The problem will be fixed at no charge to the customer for a period of 12 months from the date of notification, the company said. The action comes in the wake of a class-action lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state court by two public interest law firms seeking free repairs and reimbursement for car owners who have paid to have their Camrys fixed or checked. `` We're impressed with this step they're taking. There's no question it's a major commitment,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of the Center for Law in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> said of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement.

<TEXT>
 Afghan and Soviet forces routinely killed and tortured civilian refugees fleeing to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a human rights group charged Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, in a report called `` <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>: Unlawful Killings and Torture,'' also said civilians were killed or tortured in reprisals for the actions of Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said its main concern was the alleged killing of `` clearly helpless'' civilians, particularly refugees. It cited one instance in which 100 families were attacked twice on their 300-mile trek out of the country. Killed were 24 refugees, including seven children under the age of six, it said. `` Amnesty International has compiled evidence of what appears to be a policy of deliberate killings by Soviet and Afghan government forces of Afghan refugees found traveling toward <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' said the report. The London-based rights group said soliders have attacked `` buses and groups of women, children and men moving on foot and on horseback,'' many of whom were fleeing Soviet and Afghan bombing and shelling of their villages in retaliation for guerrilla attacks. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said its representatives visited refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and obtained information from witnesses to the attacks. The nine-page report dealt with 1987 and early 1988. The human rights group said the Afghan government should make every effort to investigate the allegations during the withdrawal of Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, scheduled to begin this month. The Soviets have been in the country since 1979 supporting the government. `` We are worried that ... during this interim period, if firm measures are not taken by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, there could be further human rights violations, especially killings and torture,'' said <PERSON> Jawid </PERSON> <PERSON> Laiq </PERSON> of Amnesty. `` There appears to be a policy to attack refugees,'' he said. `` We feel that this has occurred fairly often although we ca n't put a number on it.'' About 3 million Afghan refugees have fled across the border to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the Moslem guerrillas fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government have bases. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials have estimated that 2.2 million other Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Under an accord signed last month, the Soviet army is to begin a nine-month withdrawal of its 115,000 troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas say they will ignore the agreement and fight on. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> also cited reports of the summary executions of civilians who remained in their homes during the war, and the torture of others taken into custody. The report said, however, information suggests that `` torture may not be as systematic and as routine a form of interrogation as it was till early 1986.''

<HEAD>Police Detain Five More Strike Sympathizers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sandinista police detained five hunger strike sympathizers on Tuesday when they tried to talk to reporters in the area where workers were on the ninth day of a fast to demand higher pay. The officers, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> unit, cited a ban on unauthorized public activities. Police have taken at least 40 people into custody during the past week in connection with the hunger strike by more than 30 construction workers and car mechanics. Sandinista policewomen, wearing black berets and toting rubber truncheons, cordoned off the front of the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of socialist anti-government unions, and kept journalists away. The five sympathizers stood around the corner from the union hall and told reporters that authorities would not let them get close to the union building, where some hunger strikers peered through locked gates. Police pushed through the journalists, grabbed the five and shoved them into three different vehicles. `` This is an unauthorized public act,'' said a Sandinista police officer who refused to give his name. Police last Friday night permitted a group of <LOCATION> Sandinsta </LOCATION> students to hold a rally at the same spot where the arrests were made. Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> last week reportedly punched in the mouth the director of an anti-government radio station for broadcasting what <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said was wrong information about the strike. The Sandinista newspaper Barricada reported the altercation. About 1,500 construction workers and auto mechanics have been on strike since the end of February for higher salaries and improved working conditions. The wildcat strikes are an embarrassment to the leftist Sandinista government. Such strikes were illegal for almost six years under a state of emergency that was lifted in January. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> removed the restrictions as part of a regional peace plan which includes calls for democratic reforms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> signed the agreement last August. Public demonstrations are allowed only with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> permission. The state-run telephone company meanwhile cut off service to about 6,000 offices and homes in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> because of overdue bills totaling $ 1.8 million. The cutoff left the national banking system, embassies, state-run enterprises, government offices and thousands of homes in the capital without telephone service.

 More than 7,000 strikers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where Solidarity was born eight years ago, demanded Tuesday that the outlawed union federation be made legal again. The government called that `` not negotiable.'' Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 44, spoke to the strikers several times, but said he would not lead the strike. `` I am not your leader. I'm tired,'' said the man who vaulted the shipyard fence in 1980 and took charge of a labor revolt that brought down a government. `` You need a new <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, many more new Walesas.'' `` You declared this strike,'' he said. `` I'm with you and I'll always be with you I can advise you. I have some experience. `` If we do n't achieve a real reform this time, then we will have a bloody revolution.'' A striker offered a loaf of bread, a Polish gesture of hospitality. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> broke off a piece and munched on it. Four thousand ship-repair workers and 1,000 port workers at another <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard stayed off the job Tuesday in sympathy with the strikers at the Lenin shipyard, said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowicz </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. The report could not be independently confirmed. There was no answer at the ship repair yard. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, meanwhile, protesters marched in the streets in support of the strikers, an opposition spokesman said. They were dispersed by police. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still works at the shipyard as an electrician but is on sick leave this week, complaining of back pains and low blood sugar. On the first day of the shipyard strike Monday, workers asked that a local Solidarity chapter be approved, but on Tuesday demanded reinstatement of the union nationwide. Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was crushed and outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981. A large poster at the gate listed the other demands: higher pay, release of political prisoners and reinstatement of fired activists. Polish workers want pay raises of up to 60 percent to compensate for price increases of 42 percent that resulted from reduction of subsidies by the Communist government. The labor trouble, which has lasted more than a week, is the worst in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the crackdown on Solidarity. The biggest strike is by 15,000 workers at the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel complex in the south, the nation's largest industrial plant. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said of the demand for nationwide recognition of Solidarity: `` This is not a question that can be an object of negotiations. It is not negotiable.'' During a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> news conference, he said strike leaders were `` professional politicians'' working for Western powers. Despite his protests, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was emerging Tuesday as the dominant figure among the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> strikers. `` We lost eight years,'' he said through a loudspeaker. `` Here, in the birthplace of Solidarity, I state to the authorities that they are deepening the losses, they are forcing Solidarity to lead the nation onto the road to reforms.'' In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, strikers customarily occupy their places of work. When police cordoned off the shipyard Tuesday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> stayed inside with the strikers, said his adviser, the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>. Strikes began April 25 with a wildcat action by transit workers in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> that was settled the same day with pay raises of at least 50 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> strike began the next day. On Friday, thousand of employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> heavy machinery plant quit working but the strike was settled Saturday by promises of higher pay. Government and opposition spokesmen confirmed a brief work stoppage Tuesday at a railroad car plant in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, and opposition spokesmen said about 1,000 miners occupied a copper mine in western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for eight hours. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarmuzek </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> mine, said only 150 workers were involved. University students in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> struck in sympathy with the workers, according to opposition spokesmen in the three cities. Police have rounded up about a dozen dissident leaders and apparently cut off the telephones of others. Sources said some people were staying away from home for fear of detention. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> regional Solidarity chief, and eight other regional leaders were detained. Other prominent figures reported arrested were dissident intellectual <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Moczulski </PERSON>, leader of the rightist opposition Confederation of Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Urban called the detentions `` preventive.'' The strike at the 12,000-worker Lenin shipyard began Monday soon after the breakfast break and grew to between 7,000 and 8,000 people by Tuesday morning, said <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>, chairman of the strike committee. On Tuesday, the shipyard cranes were idle and only transport, power and some other essential operations appeared to be functioning. Hundreds of strikers were at the main gates, wearing Solidarity badges and arm bands. The gate was festooned with yellow flowers, Solidarity banners, and pictures of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s revered icon. Some workers sat atop the gate, which bore a huge sign saying `` Occupation Strike.'' Others climbed on the roofs of buildings to hear <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> speak. Cheers of `` Solidarity!'' and `` Lech, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>!'' rose on both sides of the gate when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored an easy win in the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s primary on Tuesday, telling backers: `` We're moving right along.'' Earlier, he had urged supporters in the capital to `` vote with a passion.'' It was his first primary election victory since he won <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in March. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also swept the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> primary in 1984. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not fare as well in the day's two other contests, losing to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. As voters were going to the polls in the nation's capital, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to the group of ministers, and joked about moving into the White House. `` Today we stopped by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to pick out some furniture for our new house,'' he said. Later, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> convention, where he was enthusiastically received by several thousand unionists. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> focused his speech on labor issues, telling the group he had stood with union members on many picket lines and plant closings. It has been a consistent theme in recent weeks as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in industrial-state primaries. `` I'm a working person,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke of his plan to reinvest public pension funds in domestic infrastructure projects which would provide jobs for Americans and counter the current rash of jobs that corporations are taking to cheap foreign labor markets. His speech was interrupted by thunderous applause and shouts at several points. `` Do I make sense?'' he asked them. `` Yes,'' screamed the workers. `` Then vote for me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I stood with you. Now you stand with me. When I win, you win.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had headed into the three primaries sounding a combative note, accusing front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday of running a play-it-safe `` Teflon'' campaign. Addressing a crowd of 11,000 people at <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to portray himself as the candidate of specific proposals and budget plans, accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of being vague. `` So far <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has operated with caution when we must operate with clarity and courage and candor,'' he told reporters Monday.

Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> was barred by state law from seeking a third term. <PERSON> O'Bannon </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s choice for lieutenant governor, but he put his name on the ballot as a precaution when it appeared <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> might be ruled ineligible because of a five-year residency requirement. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last week that <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> met the qualifications. `` This campaign begins tonight and it will be as important as any in the history of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> in claiming victory. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> also has a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race this year, but neither Republican Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> nor Democratic attorney <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickes </PERSON> had primary challenges.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Charges Illegal Sale Of Korean-Made M-16 Rifles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American M-16 rifles made in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been sold illegally by a Korean manufacturer to at least one nation and maybe more, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee charged Tuesday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> signed an agreement in 1971 allowing M-16s to be manufactured in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but the pact prohibited sales to third countries without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval and set a production cap. The plant was set up with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> Division of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, the maker of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rifle, and run by the Korean government. But the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> transferred the operation and ownership to a private company, <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, in 1982. Following the transfer, <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> refused to pay Colt the per-rifle royalties it had been receiving under contract, according to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>, Colt vice president for military administration. Colt has sued both the company and the Korean government. Colt began reporting to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials suspicions that the Korean company was exceeding the production cap, according to <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> aide. Later, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government investigators uncovered `` solid'' evidence of unauthorized sales to one country and `` hints'' of sales to other nations, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` We now have evidence that M-16s made in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have ended up in the hands of at least one other country, in my judgment, a country to whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have forbidden any sales,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> investigation subcommittee <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said in a statement that there also is evidence that the Korean company exceeded its production cap. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the identity of the third country was classified and could not be released. He said the subcommittee was working to have that information declassified in time for a hearing Thursday on the M-16 investigation. Colt has learned independently that the Korean firm has sold parts to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> through a <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> intermediary, according to <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> compared the case to the sale of sensitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine technology by <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese company, to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Here is another problem with a private foreign firm that owes no allegiance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or broad defense interests,'' the congressman said. `` As with the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> sale of precision instruments to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> appears more interested in the pursuit of private profit than the interests of our mutual defense alliance,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report on the allegedly illegal sales will be presented to the subcommittee at Thursday's hearing Others scheduled to testify include Colt representatives, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Eltz </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to lay claim to the presidential nomination after primary wins Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> but said `` it's going to be difficult'' for rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to overtake him now. `` I feel great about today and the results today,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> news conference after racking up big wins in two of Tuesday's three primary contests. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won the District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> primary. `` We've got to keep working,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, reminding backers he was still more than 500 delegates short of the 2,081 needed to nominate. Despite a series of primary wins over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the race for the nomination is not over. He vowed to campaign aggressively through the final day of the primary season _ June 7 _ when voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cast ballots. `` I think it's going to be difficult,'' he said when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had a chance to win the fight for the nomination. Asked if he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would view the latest primary results as a trend, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled and said: `` I hope so.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been increasingly critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days, but the governor declined to say whether he thought his rival should tone it down. `` He's going to have to make that judgment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to try to keep this as positive as I can. I do n't mind disagreement on issues. I just hope we can both continue to campaign with the respect we've had for each other in the past year.'' Asked whether he believed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was delaying an endorsement of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep the media spotlight on the almost-certain Republican nominee, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laughed and said, `` You mean the astrology endorsement?'' The White House acknowledged Tuesday that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> checks the positions of the sun, the moon and the stars in terms of scheduling the president's activities. However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he has never based any policy or decision `` in my mind'' on astrological forecasts.

<HEAD>Government Ethics Office Probing Letter Sent by Meese for Japan
Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Office of Government Ethics launched an investigation Tuesday into a letter signed by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and sent to 30,000 people encouraging them to attend a conference in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the head of the office said Tuesday night. `` It started today,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, head of the ethics office. `` As a judge, I have received invitations of this sort in year's past. I do n't know at this point what this one is.'' <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, a former judge on the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not sure what the problems might be with the mailing, adding, `` We're attempting to ascertain what the facts are.'' In the letter, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is soliciting attendance at a meeting for which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sponsor is a profit-making organization. The presidential order on ethics that is policed by the ethics office forbids federal officials from engaging in any conduct that might present the appearance of a conflict of interest or of losing objectivity in governmental decision making or favoritism. The appearance of such a problem is enough to trigger an investigation, even when such problems do n't exist in reality. It is a crime to use the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> seal for non-authorized purposes. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s letters on Office of the Attorney General stationery with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> seal invited the recipients to join him at a legal and economic conference in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Aug. 29 to Sept. 1. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> will be heading the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the conference called, `` The U.S.-Japan Bilateral Session: A New Era in Legal and Economic Relations.'' The meeting is sponsored in part by the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambassador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, according to the letter. While People to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit organization set up originally in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by then-President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, the Citizen Ambassador Program is a profit-making organization, the chairman of that firm said Tuesday night. `` Yes, the Citizen Ambassador Program is for-profit, which is how <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> established the program with the intention of making it self-supporting,'' <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said the letter went to about 30,000 people whose names were `` provided by everyone from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the advisory committees on both sides, to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said the department was unaware that a profit-making organization was involved, but he contended that even if it were, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement might still be justified due to the department's interest in international legal questions. `` People to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> came to us and represented themselves as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization,'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. `` To the extent that they're linked to some group that is profit-making, that was not known by those making decisions on the attorney general's participation. `` In the event it turns out a profit-making entity is involved, it could be argued that the department could engage in a joint venture so long as it was in the department's interest, and obviously we have an interest in international legal questions,'' he said. <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said legal and ethics authorities in the department reviewed both this letter and a similar one sent by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for a conference sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> last summer in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to make sure it was all right for the attorney general to participate. The attorney general also hosted the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year. In both cases, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s expenses will be paid by the department, he said. The two-page letter from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was dated April 26 and says, in part, `` Although attended and assisted by senior officials of the governments of both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the conference is fittingly a non-governmental one administered on behalf of the Japanese by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Keidanren </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and on the American side by the Citizen Ambassador Program of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> organization.'' `` I invite and encourage your participation. Sincerely <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Attorney General.'' The letter was accompanied by an engraved invitation and a response card to be sent to the Citizen Ambassador Program in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> which would provide details on the trip. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he could not say how much profit might be involved for his firm, which is quoting participants a cost of $ 3,240, including transportation and lodging and an $ 800 registration fee set by the Japanese organizing committee. `` I wish I knew,'' he said. `` It's not large. It depends on the participation in the conference. Those profits are used to encourage further exchanges, as they have for the last 35 years.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, was paid by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to go on last summer's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` Her way to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was paid last year by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in return for the frankly exhausting role that she fulfilled in being head of the women's contingent for the conference,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` This was an economic law conference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> hosted last year and which was very much the precursor to the Japanese meeting.'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said department regulations allow for payments for spouses to be reimbursed by an outside entity, profit-making or non-profit making, if certain conditions are met. In this case, the conditions were met, he said. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said the cost for the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> meeting, including transportation, was about $ 2,500. The registration fee there was $ 400. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s expenses for the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> trip will be picked up by the government, since he is making an official visit at the invitation of the Japanese Minister of Justice, <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashida </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Nearly one-third of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' supporters in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> primaries Tuesday said they would favor Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as his running mate if he wins the Democratic presidential nomination. Even more, about 40 percent in each state, said they favored someone other than <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the vice presidential candidate, and only a small share favored <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the No. 2 spot, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> exit polls said. As he did in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won all groups except blacks in both states. But while the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor commanded strong support in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> more of his backers had reservations. Moreover, voters expressed some unfamiliarity with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A plurality of Democrats in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and a majority in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> said his ideology was `` just about right'' as opposed to too liberal and too conservative, but another 34 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 28 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> said they did n't know. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>, a poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of people still do n't have a handle on him, this late in the primary season.'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said 33 percent of the voters in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 41 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was too liberal. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> encountered mixed results in his new effort to draw black votes from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got about 12 percent of the black vote. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll put it at 8 percent. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got just 4 percent of the black vote, a share that was more in line with the earlier contests, in which black support for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been nearly unanimous. `` In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> he tried to pick up more black support, and he's doing better in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ but only a little better,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. Among other groups, he said, `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is winning across the board.'' While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won few black votes, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won limited white support _ 15 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and about 10 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the CBS-Times poll said. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 51 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' voters said they backed him strongly, to 39 percent who had some reservations. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, however, 45 percent of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters said they had some reservations about him, and 41 percent were strong. Large shares of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters in both states viewed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> unfavorably, and only 60 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own supporters said they would back him with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the ticket, the CBS-Times polls said. Similarly, 60 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should not be offered the vice presidential slot. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls said only about 15 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> favored <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> over <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> or someone else for the vice presidential nomination. Just over 30 percent favored <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and about 40 percent said someone else. Sixty-five percent of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and 59 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> had an unfavorable view of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the CBS-Times poll said. As has been the case in other states, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fared better with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> voters that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said 54 percent of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> voters had a favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, to 38 percent unfavorable. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> the split was 48 favorable, 41 unfavorable. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll found that about 60 percent of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s voters in both states said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he were the nominee against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and just about 6 percent said they would back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. While about a third said they would not vote, `` based on previous history that will split disproportionately for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` Blacks are n't voting for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now, but given a choice of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the future will vote for him overwhelmingly.'' The margin of sampling error for the polls was 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Conrail Announces $58 Million Settlement in Amtrak Crash Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has tentatively agreed to pay $ 58 million to families of people killed in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s worst accident, the 1987 collision of a passenger train with <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engines in Chase, Md. The agreement was reached with attorneys representing the estates of the victims and is subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s directors and various courts, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> statement <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloschutz </PERSON> said he did not know how many of the victims' families the agreement covers. The $ 58 million would be in addition to the $ 7.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to place in escrow as a part of a proposed settlement with those injured in the collision, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> said it did not concede liability for the accident in the proposed settlements. On Jan. 4, 1987, former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> missed a track signal and drove three linked <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives into the path of a 660-passenger <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train traveling an estimated 125 mph. The accident, the worst in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s history, killed 16 people and injured more than 175. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> is suing to force <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to cover payments for the passenger injuries and deaths, contending that a prior agreement required <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to cover the payments. If that suit fails, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> will pursue its claims against its insurers, according to the company. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who was n't injured in the accident, was sentenced earlier this year in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to five years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Gates' brakeman at the time of the crash, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, was granted immunity from criminal action after agreeing to help prosecutors. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, an acknowledged alcoholic, has admitted smoking marijuana on the train but the court ruled that it could not determine if he was under the influence of the drug at the time of the accident. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> also faces charges in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for conspiracy, obstruction of an agency investigation, and lying to investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> about drug use.

 Religious beliefs do not excuse four polygamist clan members from blame for a church bombing and standoff with police that they claim were mandated by God, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, in closing arguments capping the federal trial of the four defendants, admonished jurors not to ask themselves what they would do if they felt divinely inspired to break the law. `` There is no revelation exception to the laws of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> was among a trio of prosecutors wrapping up their cases against clan matriarch <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>; her son-in-law, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>; <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>; and Mrs. Singer's son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. They are charged in the Jan. 16 bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and an ensuing 13-day standoff at their Marion farm. The prosecutors were followed by summations from defense attorneys. After instructions from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, the jury was expected to begin deliberating sometime Wednesday. Clan members have said they believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> ordered the bombing as a sign of the impending collapse of church, state and nation, and that he guided them through the siege. The standoff ended in a shootout that killed state Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> and wounded <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said Mrs. Singer, 45, was as much a part of the bombing as <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who admitted on the witness stand that he planted the dynamite. He was the only one of the four defendants to testify. While conceding that Mrs. Singer never actually took part in the bombing, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> contended that she aided <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, making her `` just as guilty of committing that crime herself.'' `` They were just waiting for the day. This was the biggest thing in their lives since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> pulled a gun on lawmen several years ago,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The prosecutor's reference to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, the slain polygamist husband of Mrs. Singer, drew hard stares from his widow. Singer was gunned down in 1979 at the same farm by lawmen serving arrest warrants stemming from his refusal to send his children to public schools. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Kathyrn </PERSON> <PERSON> Collard </PERSON>, countered that prosecutors had `` simply no evidence that <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> committed any of these crimes that she is accused of.'' <PERSON> Collard </PERSON> said Mrs. Singer consistently stated that during the standoff, she would simply pray and `` trust in the Lord ... Hardly the words of a hardened criminal bent on killing <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> cited Mrs. Singer's telephone statements to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> hostage negotiator and a reporter the day of the bombing. He also referred to her diary and `` prayer cards'' which asked for a divine blessing on the 87 sticks of dynamite. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> focused on the attempted murder and assault charges, devoting much of his time to evidence against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 21. <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> argued that Singer decided to kill lawmen when he took aim at the doorway of a nearby building where a six-man <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> team, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and another dog handler had secretly hidden themselves the night before. Five bullets from Singer's .30 - caliber carbine, including the slug that killed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, were found embedded in the doorway and walls of the building, <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> State authorities have said they will file murder charges after the federal trial is over. The federal indictment charged the defendants with maliciously damaging the church building with an explosive device; use of a bomb; attempted murder of federal agents; assaulting, resisting and impeding federal officers; possession of a bomb; possession of a sawed-off shotgun; and use of a firearm linked to the charges involving the federal agents. Mrs. Singer is charged with all counts, while <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> faces all but the shotgun-posession charge. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> both are charged with the assault, attempted murder and firearms violations. Charges against two other family members _ who are both daughters of Mrs. Singer and wives of <LOCATION> Addam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swapp </LOCATION> _ were dropped. In his defense summation, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, told jurors that his client had expected a violent confrontation from authorities following the bombing, but he did n't plan one. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> also said the testimony of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents about the shootout contained inconsitencies.

<HEAD>Johnny Carson Says `Tonight Show' To Resume Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` The Tonight Show'' will resume production May 11 with <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> writing his own material after talks with striking scriptwriters failed, the entertainer said Tuesday. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> is believed to be the first independent producer to defy the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which began March 7. He will write his opening monologue and guest introductions, with no striking writers returning to work, his statement said. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hookstratten </PERSON>, said he was `` stupefied by the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent lack of desire to negotiate in good faith.'' <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said Tuesday that union negotiators talked with <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s production company earlier in the day and added that, `` We are ready and willing to continue to negotiate in good faith.'' Because <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> is not a guild member, he would not violate the strike by writing his own material, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. In his statement, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he had `` exhausted every possibility of reaching an agreement'' and was concerned about his show's staff. `` There are numerous ` Tonight Show' staff members, many have been with us for over 20 years, who are in danger of losing their jobs if this strike goes on much longer. I ca n't let that happen. I also ca n't turn my back on the ` Tonight Show' audience, who've remained loyal these past 25 years It's time to go back to work.'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s decision. The network has been airing reruns during the strike. `` TV and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> are not the same without him,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainer's production company, had met with the guild six times since March 23, with the last formal session on April 28 The company has been seeking a waiver from the strike or an independent agreement with the guild. <PERSON> Hookstratten </PERSON> said the production company had agreed to nearly all of the union's contract conditions before the guild informed <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> last week that it would not ratify any independent contracts until at least 10 percent of its 9,000 members had been offered jobs by independent producers. The guild has approved only two independent contracts so far, with the `` New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> Productions, makers of the movie `` Ghostbusters.'' The main issues in the writers' strike against television and movie producers are payment for foreign broadcasts and reruns and the writers' degree of creative control they have over their work. There have been no formal negotiations since mediated talks broke off March 10.

 More than 7,000 strikers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where Solidarity was born eight years ago, demanded Tuesday that the outlawed union federation be made legal again. The government called that `` not negotiable.'' Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 44, spoke to the strikers several times, but said he would not lead the strike. `` I am not your leader. I'm tired.'' On the first day of the shipyard strike Monday, workers asked that a local Solidarity chapter be approved, but on Tuesday demanded reinstatement of the union nationwide. Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was crushed and outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981.

<HEAD>Priest Preaches Gospel Hard For Some To Swallow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In his preaching from the Bible, a Roman Catholic priest goes literally by the book, telling parishioners they must sell all worldly possessions and give their money to the poor. For this literal interpretation of the Gospel, the Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> has been forced to leave three northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> parishes. `` It's scary for me but as much as I would like to tell people what they want to hear, I've got a God who tells me to tell people what they've got to hear,'' said the 28-year-old priest. He currently is at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, but has no regular congregation and no assignment at least until June. Until then, leaders of the Diocese of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> want him to write a book outlining his beliefs so they can check it against <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> doctrine. `` Christianity means living like <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> lived, giving like <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> gave and forgiving like <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> forgave. Nothing less. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> did n't say ` Make a truce with me.' He said ` surrender,''' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. He is n't ready to make a truce. `` My message is scary,'' he said in a recent interview. `` It says when you've got nothing left but the Lord, you've got all you need.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, lanky and bearded with long hair, said his message was hard for some to swallow. `` The Gospel should bring comfort to the discomfortable and discomfort to the comfortable,'' he said. After <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> seminary in <LOCATION> Mundelein </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> first attracted attention while serving as a deacon at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theresa </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985 His homilies shocked the congregation, he recalled. Despite adverse reaction to his strong teachings, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was ordained and given a five-year assignment as an associate pastor in a <LOCATION> Bolingbrook </LOCATION> church he declined to name. He lasted five months and left because of a personality conflict, he said. His next scheduled five-year assignment was <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>. Among the ideas he pushed there was closing the parish for a month so the priests could fast and pray. `` There was a lot of excitment and turmoil,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. `` And about a year after I arrived they asked me to leave.'' Then he was assigned to the fast growing, upper-middle-income suburb of <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, not far from where he grew up in <LOCATION> Elmhurst </LOCATION>. `` These are my people out there,'' he said. `` I should be just like them but the values of the suburbs are symptomatic of the deeper conflicts inside us. We cling to status and material things.'' So <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> suggested Sts. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> turn the building over to the homeless. A letter to a local newspaper denounced him as `` a zealot ... attempting to change the character of the entire parish.'' Parishioner <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said many in the congregation thought his message was better suited for missionary work. Some churchgoers sided with <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. `` He said things a lot of Catholics are longing to hear,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Yet <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said he left <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION> because he did n't want to further divide the parish, and retreated to <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to write his book.

 Somehow, they do n't seem made for each other. Imagine: <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest and windiest playwright, and television, the medium that shrank the country's attention span But director <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s rapid-fire revival of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' works better on the tube than it did in the theater The production, tonight's offering from `` American Playhouse'' on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, was seen on Broadway two years ago. It stars <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> as the tyrannical <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> as his drug-addled wife <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Their sons are played by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, who appeared in the television movie `` The Murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phagan </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>, before he turned into one of TV's more memorable villains on `` Wiseguy.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> created quite a fuss in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with his revved-up version of what is considered <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s greatest and most autobiographical play. By overlapping dialogue and a little cutting, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> slashed the running time from four hours to three. `` The real topic of the play is a series of tellings and listenings, of tellings and half-listenings, of tellings and failing to listen,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in an interview with the British theater magazine Plays and Players. Everyone talks in `` Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which takes place over one long summer night in 1912, and the conversations are acrimonious, self-serving and ultimately heart-breaking. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> is a vainglorious husband and father. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is a defeated woman, taking refuge in morphine. Her older son, <PERSON> Jamey </PERSON>, a half-hearted actor, finds his solace in liquor, while the younger boy, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON>, a would-be writer modeled after <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> himself, finds his career threated by tuberculosis. They blame each other, never themselves. In the theater, the simultaneous conversations turned to mush. On television, close-ups keep the audience in touch. <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> are more successful on the small screen, too, revealing depths that were missing from their theater performances. <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> captures the preening, self-centered qualities that destroy <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON>'s wife and turn his sons against him. If the ultimate tragedy eludes him, he gives the character a degree of credibility. Miss <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> is a surprise. She seemed strangely muted on stage, unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by life. That desperation comes across in the television version and even acquires a delicate, other - worldly character <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> were the strongest actors on stage and their strengths still are evident here. <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> is particularly moving as the bitter son who realizes he has failed and can do nothing about it. This year is the centennial of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s birth and `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' will be very much a part of worldwide festivities A revival directed by <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> just opened in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> to rave reviews. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> will star in a revival this summer on Broadway directed by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. The Broadway production and cast will alternate performances with `` Ah, Wilderness!,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s only comedy. `` Ah, Wilderness!'' represents a sunny, innocent family life that <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> wished for but never found. `` Long Day's Journey'' was the other side of his psyche. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s television production explores it with uncommon and unnerving grace.

 We take you to our cliffhanger desk for these late bulletins: <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> flips out on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Miami Vice,'' <PERSON> Valene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> does herself in on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Knots Landing'' and <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> declares war on the entire world in `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. It's that time of the year when television gives series viewers something to chew on over the summer. The biggest cliffhanger of all, however, is whether these shows will be back in the fall to save their heroes and heroines. The strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> has the television and film industry in a quandary. Since the writers walked out March 7, not a word has been written. In some cases, the writers did n't even wrap up this season's action, much less get to next season's cliffhanger resolutions. Here are the details: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moonlighting'' was forced to cancel its big season-ender, which would have featured a sequence in 3-D.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> almost declined to direct the television version of `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,'' until he realized how many people were glued to their TV sets every day for the Iran-Contra hearings. `` I thought, if I can do the same thing, maybe they've trained an audience for me,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. Trained or not, audiences seeking fine drama will do well to catch `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' Sunday on CBS. The play is still riveting, <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s direction is poetic, and the performances by his distinguished young cast are superb all the way around. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, best-known for his feature films -LRB- `` M-A-S-H,'' `` <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'' -RRB- and a veteran of filming stage works -LRB- `` Streamers,'' `` Come Back to the 5 & amp; Dime, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'' -RRB-, said he at first had no interest in the project because of the 1954 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dmytryk </PERSON> film classic `` The Caine Mutiny,'' which starred <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> as quintessential petty tyrant Capt. <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON>. This is not a remake of the movie, but rather the Broadway play <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON> adapted from his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The movie was based on the entire novel. The play is just the court-martial, the dramatic core of the book. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, who co-produced the piece, intentionally cast a younger <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON> than audiences who remember <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> will expect, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -LRB- `` Midnight Express'' -RRB-. `` <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON> was 37 years old in that book, and <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is 38,'' said <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>. `` I tried to bring all those ages down to what was real.'' It was a wise move. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> makes the role his own. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogosian </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> actor and playwright -LRB- `` Talk Radio'' -RRB-, will be new to most viewers, though he's done guest shots on such network shows as `` Crime Story'' and `` Miami Vice.'' He's excellent as Lt. <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, the reluctant defense attorney. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> plays Lt. <PERSON> Maryk </PERSON>, the not-too-bright young officer on trial for mutiny for relieving <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON> of command in a typhoon. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phagan </PERSON>'' -RRB- plays Lt. Cmdr. Challee, the prosecutor who gets more than he bargained for. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> has a small but meaty role as Lt. <PERSON> Keefer </PERSON>, the non-committal witness who turns out to be a pivotal character in the drama. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who stars in the <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> series <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> is directing, `` <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'88,'' plays Capt. <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>, the judge. `` The tragic figure in that case to me was Challee,'' said <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>. `` He's the guy who felt betrayed.'' As the court-martial opens, <PERSON> Challee </PERSON> is so sure of his case against <PERSON> Maryk </PERSON>, he has talked his friend, <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, into serving as defense attorney. At first <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> is contemptuous of his own client and seems almost negligent in his defense. But <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> wants to win, and as the court-martial progresses, he takes his distasteful task to heart, expertly baiting <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON> until the captain breaks down on the stand before the shocked but sympathetic court-martial. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> did n't get much of an audience for his first network TV projects, the <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> plays `` The Dumbwaiter'' and `` The Room'' for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' is a lot more accessible to a large audience. As evidenced by viewer interest in the Iran-Contra and <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> hearings and the success of television shows about lawyers, there's a natural drama to the courtroom setting. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> enhances <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>'s piece with a unique brand of realism. The camera roams around the courtroom like an eye, picking up details here and there, like <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON>'s incessant clicking of two steel ball bearings to calm his nerves. True to the <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> style, characters talk over each other in asides that ca n't quite be made out, until a conversation finally predominates. In the first half of the drama, a band practices outside on the parade field, providing patriotic background music for the prosecution's case. When the defense takes over the next day, it is raining. In an especially poetic moment, after <PERSON> Queeg </PERSON> has been excused from the stand, <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s camera stays on him in a very long shot as he leaves the far end of the building, a lost and broken man. `` I think at the end after it's all over there'll be a lot of that, ` What was that? Who's the bad guy?' That's what I want,'' said <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, who seems to have already gotten the only review he needs: `` I got a nice letter from <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON> who said it was the first time any of his work had ever been translated even close to his satisfaction,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` I have it in my jacket.''

 The idea has a nice ring to it: <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in two hours. Zooming over the Earth at 25 times the speed of sound. Crossing the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in an airplane so revolutionary the space shuttle and the Concorde become old hat. Third millenium, here we come. That airplane, or something like it, is taking shape at this and other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> centers in bits and pieces: a model is assaulted in a wind tunnel by 4,800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees below zero; an electron beam illuminates air flow around a scaled-down plane; a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough 3,000-feet long, sensitive to every nuance of resistance; a photograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues of green, orange, yellow, blue and magenta; the most powerful computer ever built ingests world-class problems and spits out answers; a standard airplane circles over <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, piloted not from the standard cockpit in front, but from a second, all-electronic one, in its passenger section. The `` Little A'' in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> _ the aeronautics part of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> _ is not as flashy as the `` Big S'' and gets only 7 percent of the agency's budget, but its accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways. A poultry plant in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, is quieter because of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> aeronautics; water quality in many places is improved because of aeronautics technology; firemen wear better protective clothing. `` We are called the space agency by many, probably including yourself,'' <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>, the director for flight systems at the <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, tells a visitor, a bit of resignation in his voice. `` Many of us here think the A is a large one.'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>'s work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics, 40 percent space, with a hefty dose of military work in both. With other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> research centers _ Ames and <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ its business is to develop technology and pass it on, without cost, to aircraft companies. The federal government has played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago. The agency has never built an airplane, but few planes fly today without engines, designs, materials and structures conceived at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are doing research that benefits the country,'' says <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>. `` It is available to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, whoever wants to build transport or high performance aircraft.'' No single company alone could afford <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2 billion investment in wind tunnels. Here at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, they do n't talk about the `` Orient Express.'' It's either the <ORGANIZATION> NASP </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plane </ORGANIZATION>, or better yet the X-30, next in a string of experimental planes that began with <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>'s X-1, breaker of the sound barrier. When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made his rosy prediction about the <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster, engineers had already taken years to decide the X-30 was possible. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s one-paragraph announcement signaled the start of Phase 2, perfecting the technology, which will last until the summer of 1990, when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and decide whether to build the X-30. Phase 3, in the mid -'90s, would see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the 21st century That's the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft project ever undertaken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It will cost $ 3.3 billion. Clearly <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which is sharing the cost, have something more practical in mind than building one or two prototype planes, merely to prove it can be done. The military and package-delivery firms such as <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION> are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25 times the speed of sound _ fast enough to get into orbit. But the aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower but far more useful aircraft of the future.

 `` There is tremendous potential for all kinds of vehicles operating at high Mach numbers,'' says <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwoyer </PERSON>, manager of hypersonic technology at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>. `` The National Aerospace program is aimed at an experimental aircraft to demonstrate technologies for this family of hypersonic aircraft.'' The speed of sound, which varies with temperature and density of air, is represented by a Mach number. Airplanes that fly below <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 1 are subsonic; those that fly faster are supersonic. Those that fly more than five times the speed of sound, above <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 5, are designated hypersonic. To escape the atmosphere into orbit, a plane must achieve Mach 25. So far the big airplane manufacturers have little interest in building passenger aircraft that fly at Mach 25, no matter what the president said. They do want, for the years 2000 to 2010, a supersonic airplane capable of flying at <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 2 to Mach 3.5. At Mach 2.7, a trip from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> would take just under four hours, compared with 12 to 14 hours subsonic. The ideal Mach number is one of the big questions facing the engineers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> researched a supersonic transport, the SST, in the 1960s, but dropped the program in 1970 because of costs. The space shuttle had been designed, the Apollo moon program was winding down and there seemed no need for space missions requiring re-entry with the accompanying hypersonic speeds. In addition, the price of jet fuel, which had been 10 cents a gallon when research started, jumped to $ 1.30. While American interest dropped, the British and French produced the Concorde, a plane capable of twice the speed of sound. But its birth coincided with heightened environmental concerns, and the sonic boom scared people; many governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, barred it from flying over land. Moreover, the Concorde was designed with'60s technology and carries barely enough fuel to make it across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` Concorde is restricted to over-water flights under 2,200-miles long, and there are n't many oceans that small,'' says <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of aeronautics at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>. `` I think Concorde is designed too small, it can carry only 100 people and it's cramped. All our studies say you really want 200 to 250 passengers for an economically viable SST.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> sees a real need for an SST. `` If you look at the demographics of air travel, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> rim is the fastest growing international market,'' he says. `` It's growing at a rate twice that of the market between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not alone in its SST interest. The British have a project called Hotol that's vaguely similar to the X-30, and the French are working on the <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION> space plane, which requires hypersonic technology for re-entry. There is big interest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the engines that will power hypersonic flight, and the Japanese are talking about building a shuttle. Despite such competition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> treats its aeronautics limb as a poor relative. In a $ 9 billion <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget, the spending for this year's aeronautics R & amp; D is $ 430 million, with $ 53 million of that earmarked for the aerospace plane. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to develop a supersonic transport to be ready in the first decade of the 21st century, it will have to commit $ 800 million over the next five to seven years. Current spending is $ 3 million a year. Money is a sensitive issue at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>. Until 1970, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet transport industry had 90 percent of the long-range market. Now that percentage is down to 70. Aerospace exports grew from $ 1.7 billion in 1960 to $ 25 billion in 1987, but imports increased from $ 61 million to $ 7.9 billion _ in large part due to the success of the French Airbus. <PERSON> Dwoyer </PERSON> says the aerospace type plane is a concept so revolutionary that whoever gets it first will have a tremendous leg up in the next century. And if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is n't in front, he says, we might be flying the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> in a <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Candide: Leonard Bernstein's 30-Year-Old Dream</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s musical, `` Candide,'' is whistling a happy tune in a Scottish Opera production that aims to be the fullest version yet of this show. `` The joy here is we're actually doing what <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> -RRB- wanted for 30 years,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON>, music director of Scottish Opera, about the company's new `` Candide,'' which opens May 19 at <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>'s Theater Royal. It's the first time the piece will be seen in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since a pared-down, 13-instrument version played the <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in 1981. Co-directed by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and boasting an orchestra of 60, it transfers in December to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is artistic director. American tenor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Beudert </PERSON> sings the title role of the eternally hopeful Candide who learns to be properly skeptical of this `` best of all possible worlds.'' The show is adapted from <ORGANIZATION> Voltaire </ORGANIZATION>'s 1759 French novel about the limits of optimism during the European Enlightenment. <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON>, an American who assumed his post with Scottish Opera last August, said the current `` Candide'' has a melodic and thematic breadth that will surprise those accustomed to its earlier versions. `` The two things <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> objected to -LRB- before -RRB- were the placement of the songs and its constant silliness,'' said <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON>, who became acquainted with the work when <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> asked him to conduct the 1974 Broadway revival. `` There's a greater seriousness of purpose in this ` Candide,''' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- at the end of the day, why we're doing it is because of its wonderful score.'' That score, with such tunes as `` Glitter and Be Gay'' and `` Oh, Happy We,'' is the unassailable strength of a show that has had a patchy on-stage past. Its 1956 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premier, with Broadway veteran <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> as Candide's beloved Cunegonde, lasted just 73 performances, despite a book by playwright <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON> and direction by <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. It subsequently flopped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1961. The jazzy 1974 revival, rewritten by <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, won five <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards and ran for 740 performances. But it suffered from what <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON> called `` a <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> tone'' that violated <PERSON> Voltaire </PERSON>'s pungent satire. A third version, with lyrics by the American poet laureate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>, joined the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> repertoire in 1982. The <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> production embraces all three in what <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON> calls `` a framework -LRB- for ` Candide' -RRB- in which all the viable songs actually fit.'' `` People are becoming more and more aware that his music is really good,'' <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who turns 70 on August 25. Co-director <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he was intrigued by the peculiar history of the show. `` It's like trying to darn an enormous spider web,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose varied directing credits include <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Rigoletto,'' updated to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the 1950s, for the English National Opera and a speedy staging of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' on Broadway and in Neither <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON> said they paid much heed to the debate over whether musicals belong in the opera house. `` I see the two as a continuum,'' said <PERSON> Mauceri </PERSON>, who won a Tony award for co-producing the 1983 Broadway revival of <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s 1934 `` On Your Toes.'' `` ` Dreamgirls' should not be produced by an opera house, but ` My Fair Lady' could be,'' he said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> compared the two genres to `` different animal species, as opposed to being totally distinct.'' `` I'm not sure ` Candide' is an opera at all,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I do n't quite know what it is; one does n't have to make up one's mind.

 After 5 -LCB- years of expansion, the economy is gaining a second wind. The evidence is not easy to accept, since it appears at odds with history, but it also appears incontrovertible. Inflation is in check. A million jobs have been created in three months. Wages are steady rather than inflationary. Productivity, which many thought to be waning, continues to improve. Manufacturing is strong. The consumer, thought by many to have run out of cash and desire earlier this year, has been helped by rising personal income. Corporate earnings are coming in stronger than anticipated. While the trade deficit continues, and even grew worse in the latest period reported, it also seems destined for improvement. Corporations have lost their fear of expanding; production of manufactured export items is growing. Many companies also are benefitting from earlier programs aimed at improving efficiency. Labor-management cooperation has improved. And the bulge of inexperienced workers that had lowered productivity now has been absorbed. That old bugaboo, the budget deficit, remains. So do the old worries about the dollar, inflation, recession, competitiveness, access to markets, a low savings rate, high household debt and dependence on foreign investors. But the big fear of financial and economic calamity has n't followed the stock market collapse It remains a factor in almost every stock market newsletter and economic commentary, expressed as a fear but not as a fact. Overall, according to an economic update presented this spring by the Univeristy of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, `` it now looks as if the great crash of 1987 will be recorded as an interesting non-event.'' Stock market prices did have their sharpest one-day decline in history but, according to the report, there appears to have been very little cumulative consequence of that event on the real economy. Among the more remarkable aspects of the economy's performance has been its propensity to steer down the middle between boom and bust. Month after month prices, wages, interest rates and productivity gains have been moderate. As the good news is recognized, if reluctantly by some pessimists, it appears that a growing number of economists have pushed back their estimates of the next recession's onset. Six months ago, the recession was forecast for now. But now it is forecast for no sooner than very late this year or 1989 _ or even 1990, which is about as far out on the limb chronologically that any economist dares to stand. Reviewing the more recent analyses from banks, brokers, businesses and academe, it becomes clear that the big unknowns being discussed today are less economic than political: Elections, trade policies, wars, oil availability. How could the stock market crash be an economic `` non-event'' rather than a forecast of things to come? For one thing, very few families had large holdings of common stocks. One study, for example, shows that less than 2 percent of households had more than $ 100,000 of direct holdings. More and more, the crash is being viewed in technical rather than economic terms, as an event that had little significance as an omen of things to come but as an internal failure of the market mechanism itself. While it still has an impact on the thinking of many people, that impact seems to be waning. And helping to put it in the past are those encouraging economic statistics that suggest continued moderate growth. End Adv PMs Wednesday May 4

<HEAD>Detour From Judaism Revises Ancient Religion Without God</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WATERTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One Sunday a month, about 50 Jews gather here for what they consider a religious service. But they neither pray nor worship God. Without chants or ritual, they sit in a big circle of folding chairs and talk about what it means to be Jewish. They call themselves Humanistic Jews. Agnostics and atheists largely in their 30s and 40s, they're devoted to discovering their Jewish moral roots and adapting a 5,000-year-old religion to the late 20th century. Their approach echoes the anti-establishment themes of the l960's. Services at <LOCATION> Kahal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> B'raira </LOCATION> _ meaning `` community of choice'' _ even resemble the old rap sessions. `` We just grab a cup of coffee and start talking,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisman </PERSON>, 43, a biology professor and president of the Humanistic congregation in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>. The subject might be how to talk to children about God, intermarriage or the Jewish sanctuary movement and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lisman </PERSON> joined the congregation because he wanted to educate his son and daughter in their heritage but not in the old-fashioned way. `` We are n't strongly religious but we still felt our Jewishness is a very strong part of us,'' <PERSON> Lisman </PERSON> said. While most of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 10,000 Humanistic Jews are products of the alienated generation of the ` 60s, members also include older Jews who do n't believe in God yet want to hold on to the ancient religion on their own terms. Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1963 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> by a disgruntled Reform rabbi named <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>. When national news magazines learned about what they labeled an atheistic rabbi, some traditional Jews were alarmed. But the divergence never caught on in a big way and in the intervening 25 years this detour from conventional Judaism remains little known. To observers and even some participants, Humanistic Judaism seems an eccentric holdout from the alienated era in which it was born. It's the Jewish answer to the God-is-dead movement that followed World War II, said Professor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Borowitz </PERSON>, a theolgian at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> seminary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The Greeks called it a failure of nerve.'' Like other Jewish scholars, <PERSON> Borowitz </PERSON> regards <ORGANIZATION> Humanistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as inconsequential. `` It does n't seem to be getting very far,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` In the 1960s, there were some people who were very angered by it because of a sense that it was too blatant a betrayal of Judaism,'' <PERSON> Borowitz </PERSON> said. `` But to the overwhelming majority of the Jewish community, secularism does n't seem to be the wave of the future.'' Nevertheless, from eight founding families, <ORGANIZATION> Humanistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> has grown to about 30 congregations nationwide, three big enough to build synagogues in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Overseas, it claims another 20,000 adherents in 10 countries from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> Small as its following is, <ORGANIZATION> Humanistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> aims to be an alternative to the traditions of Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and <ORGANIZATION> Reconstructionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. `` The others are God-oriented,'' said Wine. `` We're people-oriented We believe in the power of people to solve human problems.'' Humanistic tenets hold that Judaism is not a religion but a historical culture, that reason _ not faith _ is the route to truth and that the only reality is the natural world. `` Our philosophy of life is not prayer or worship but ethics and morality,'' Wine said. At a recent morning service of <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON> <PERSON> B'raira </PERSON>, the subject was the Jewish way of death. Rabbi <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, a believer who was hired to advise the group, gave a lecture on Jewish customs of burial and grieving through the ages. She also answered a chorus of questions. One man asked about cremation. It is n't kosher, she said, especially since the Holocaust and the Nazi crematoria. A woman asked about whether miscarried babies can get a funeral and learned that in Judaism babies are n't considered fully human until they are 30 days old. At the end of the 90-minute service and a buzz of similar questions, a committee was assigned to devise a Humanistic funeral service. `` People who do n't believe in a traditional God, have the same need to be meaningful,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> reminded them. Humanistic Jews are obeying an impulse common to many. Surveys show that while the 5.8 million American Jews increasingly forgo the weekly rituals practiced by their parents, about 85 percent still observe the main holidays on the Jewish calendar. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher in Jewish studies, said, `` There's a very strong desire not to break ties with the past. `` American Jews today are more comfortable with their Jewishness than they were 30 years ago. But they want to -LRB- express their Judaism -RRB- creatively. And that's why you get these strange hybrid rituals of the Humanists. I would call it creative revision of the Jewish past.''

 History is repeating itself on the Isle of Man as <PERSON> William </PERSON> the Conqueror and his cohorts prepare once again for the Battle of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in 1066. Only this time <PERSON> William </PERSON> will be an actor wearing chain mail and there will be television cameras looking on, reporting the war as it happens. With an 11-week shoot on 18 European locations, `` Timeline'' is using on-camera reporters and an anchorman, all played by professional actors, to turn the distant past into the stuff of today's nightly news. `` It's a way to give history the immediacy and excitement of a fast-breaking news story,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, the director and executive producer. The six-hour $ 2.2 million series applies the tenets of broadcast news to over 400 years of medieval history. The show, featuring about 280 speaking parts and up to 5,000 extras, is to be aired on public television in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in January and later on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Channel 4. `` It's dramatized but it's not drama; it's history, but it's not a history lesson,'' <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said in an interview before flying to the Isle of Man, a picturesque if blustery island in the Irish Sea 30 miles west of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In the present segment, the first to be shot, it's September 25, 1066, and the Manx village of Peel, population 2,500, is standing in for the French coastal town of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valery-sur-Somme </LOCATION>. The Norman duke, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, is waiting for the winds to change so that his troops can sail across the English Channel and fight the Battle of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> on October 14, 1066. `` Everybody's sitting about bored, ready to go,'' said production designer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooley </PERSON>, as a motley group of local extras and actors rehearsed their scenes amid the ruins of a hilltop castle on the island's western coast. `` In the pivotal scene, the wind does change,'' <PERSON> Wooley </PERSON> said. `` Instead of <PERSON> William </PERSON> the Conqueror, he should have been called <PERSON> William </PERSON> the Lucky.'' The series will cover such events as the Black Death, which wiped out one-third of the world populace during the 14th and 15th centuries, and the conquest of <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, then Constantinople, in 1453. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said he avoided recent events in choosing what to dramatize. `` We first set down the parameters to cover the coming of Christianity and the Roman Empire up to the Industrial Revolution,'' said the director, an <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> graduate who began his career as a tea-boy on the set of the hit TV series `` The Avengers.'' `` Beyond that, history gets complicated; you can no longer simplify it in quite this way.'' The show's historical adviser, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON>, disagreed: `` A medievalist would say the further back you go, the more complicated history gets.'' She said the complications make history interesting. `` We are lulled by similarities in thinking, ` Ah yes, they -LRB- historical figures -RRB- are just like us,' but they really were n't,'' said <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON>, wrapped in a scarf and a winter coat against the coastal chill. `` The past is not like the present; that's what makes it a useful intellectual exercise.'' On sabbatical from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where she is a professor of medieval history, <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON> said she approved of the show's efforts to make history accessible. `` I know there are some historians who really object to the idea,'' she said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I guess my feeling is that history is so badly taught, as long as we have the football coach or the basketball coach _ whichever one is n't teaching English _ teach history, I'd like to see history that looks right and is right and entertaining.'' <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON> said her task was to verify matters ranging from historical methodology to horns. `` Did Vikings remove the horns on cattle or not?'' she said. `` We have this pseudo-Viking from a university whose particular field is agricultural animals in the Middle Ages who's saying you can not have lopped-off horns. `` But I can show you Anglo-Saxon laws where people were in fact required to lop off the horns of cattle so you do not <PERSON> gore </PERSON> your neighbors, or your neighbors' cattle.'' For locals such as blacksmith <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, `` Timeline'' is an opportunity to recreate his real-life profession on-screen. `` It's good fun; the island could do with something like this to put it on the map,'' the 42-year-old <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. His wife, <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON>, has a bit part in the show as well, playing what <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> described as `` a lusty maiden, or something.'' Co-producer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> had nothing but praise for his cast: `` We're smearing mud on their costumes, and they're letting us do it. God love'em,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> WINDHOEK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ In a far-off garrison town, blacks complain of abuse and atrocities by South African soldiers based there. Here in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> white secretaries take memos from black Cabinet members and pour their tea. Officially, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s vision of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s future reflects the hilltop harmony of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the territory's capital, rather than the garrison town, <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, near wartorn <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to the north. But many South-West Africans, moderates as well as militants, are deeply suspicious of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s intentions toward <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> These suspicions were heightened in early April when President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> came for a visit and proposed new powers for his chief representative in the territory. The proposal was seen as weakening the `` transitional'' government installed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1985 to lay the groundwork for independence. Moderates who hold a majority on the coalition Cabinet accused <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of undermining their efforts to gain credibility as an alternative to the pro-independence guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Actions like this wo n't help force <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> to the bargaining table,'' said the Cabinet's chairman, <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Katjiuongua </PERSON>, a black, who has threatened to quit. `` We're trying to get people to talk to us, but you do n't talk to people who do n't have power.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, carries on in its 22-year-old bush war for independence despite heavy losses and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s overwhelming military advantage. Guerrilla leaders and many others are skeptical of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s professed willingness to allow <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-supervised </LOCATION> independence elections in the territory upon the withdrawal of Cuban troops helping fight a pro-Western faction in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which formally recognizes the name <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, has designated <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> as the `` sole and authentic'' representative of the South-West African people, atlhough more than 40 political parties operate in the territory. By all accounts, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> would be the likely winner in a U.N.-run election because of its strong support in the Ovambo region around <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, where about half the territory's 1.3 million people live. But widespread doubts persist that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would agree to elections in which the Marxist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders had the edge. On at least one major issue, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s moderates and militants share common ground. Both want an end to apartheid-style laws that create ethnically based political structures and enable the 78,000 whites to maintain segregated schools and hospitals. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, although hinting at some flexibility on the issue, has made it clear he wants to protect the `` group rights'' of whites. The president's chief representative in the territory, Administrator-General <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, says whites should have the option of joining a non-racial system or maintaining a segregated administration to finance and run their own affairs. `` The whites are only 6 percent of the population, but they manage the infrastructure and the economy,'' <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> maintained. `` They ca n't be written off because of their small numbers.'' This attitude irks white moderates such as <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudge </PERSON>, the minister of finance and government affairs, who opposes ethnic politics and holds that whites do n't need discriminatory laws to preserve their culture. But conservative whites are pressing <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to maintain some type of political apartheid, and the increasingly powerful far-right in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is likely to create an uproar if non-racialism becomes law in the territory. `` It's discrimination that makes so many people hostile to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Katjiuongua </PERSON>, the Cabinet chairman. `` I want to be a national leader, not an ethnic leader.'' As big as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> combined, mineral-rich <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been administered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the end of World War I, under a League of Nations mandate. In the early 1970s the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> formally declared it a territory illegally occupied by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and has called repeatedly for independence elections that would include <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. The new powers extended to Administrator-General <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> authorize him to act against news media and organizations deemed to be `` subversive,'' but for now a relatively high degree of political freedom exists. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to function as a political organization, and a pro-SWAPO weekly newspaper, The Namibian, regularly reports on alleged atrocities by the security forces in <LOCATION> Ovambo </LOCATION>. During <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s visit, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters demonstrated in downtown <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, displaying placards with slogans such as `` Botha: Stop Sucking Our Blood.'' The police kept a low profile. Not everyone blames <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for the many divisions within <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but the widespread sentiment is that heavy-handed moves by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government wo n't improve the situation.

<HEAD>Productivity Up Nearly 1 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic activity is proceeding at a healthy pace, according to a trio of government reports indicating rising factory orders and construction spending in March, and growing first-quarter productivity. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that productivity of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry _ its efficiency in producing goods and services _ rose by an annual rate of 0.9 percent during the first quarter. The gain reversed a 1 percent decline in the final three months of 1987. Excluding agriculture and government, the businesses responsible for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity raised their output of goods and services by 2.7 percent with only a 1.7 percent increase in hours worked. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said factory orders rose 1.6 percent in March. The increase, to a seasonally adjusted $ 216.08 billion after no change in February and a decrease in January, was seen as coming from both domestic and foreign markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported construction spending rose by 1.5 percent, much of it on government building and highway projects. The jump was led by a 5.4 percent surge in government projects, some of the result of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overriding President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of an $ 88 billion highway bill last year. On Wall Street, blue-chip stocks staged a modest rally, but the rest of the market lagged in a sluggish session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.94 to 2,043.27 but declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 3 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar was mixed against major currencies. Bond prices fell. Oil futures prices turned sharply lower in a wave of selling prompted by the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to set temporary production cuts. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, slid to $ 17.14 per barrel, down 85 cents from Friday's close. The productivity gains were surprising to most economists in the wake of employment reports showing the creation of nearly 1 million new jobs the first three months of 1988. The reports showed wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, raising the labor costs associated with each service or product by 2.4 percent annually. Those unit labor costs had soared at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the final quarter of 1987, triggering fears among several analysts that the nation was on the verge of wage-driven inflation. `` Productivity is the cushion you can put in between wage increases and price increases; this is good news for inflation,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. After taking inflation into account, the first quarter wage gains gave workers no new purchasing power. Still, it was the first time since the last quarter of 1986 that they have even kept pace with inflation.

 Oil futures prices have turned sharply lower in response to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to set temporary production cuts in four days of negotiations. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for West Texas Intermediate oil, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, slid to $ 17.14 per barrel on Monday, down 85 cents from Friday's close.

 The stalemate that doomed <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s latest meeting also has dimmed prospects for creating a new global alliance of oil producers. The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says it will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties with other oil producers. But the going is likely to be slow. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> wants to persuade as many independent producers as possible to join the cartel in restraining production as a means of boosting prices to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s official target of $ 18 dollars a barrel. <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, said Monday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> there was `` unanimous recognition in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'' that it alone can not keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from lagging. Last week, a group of six independent producers led by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> met with a committee of six <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers and presented an offer: we'll cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise. The two groups issued a joint communique declaring `` the beginning of a new stage of cooperation'' among some of the world's biggest oil-producing countries But that's as far as it went. The non-OPEC officials left town and all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers spent four days debating the offer, only to suspend the talks after falling into a bitter impasse. Cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting the non-OPEC offer, they just wanted more time to think it over. The offer, by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, was for two months of production cuts starting May 1. Now that the starting date has passed and the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders have gone home, there is little chance that the two groups will get back to considering joint production cuts before next year. That's because oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this year, eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the problem of sharing any cutbacks This is likely to be welcomed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has campaigned publicly against what he called efforts to create a `` world <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Even so, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> says it will try to sustain a dialogue with non-OPEC exporters, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which ranks as the world's largest oil producer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's No. 2 producer. `` It is important that we keep talking to them,'' <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president, said of the six independent exporters who met in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` The opportunity given to us is one that we can not take lightly.'' The reasons are obvious. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s capacity for influencing oil prices gradually has been eroded by the emergence of new oil producers in all corners of the globe. Ironically, it was the sudden and severe increases in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil prices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive for countries to step up their search for oil. In recent years <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and many other nations have become oil exporters. As production outside its control steadily rose, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> reluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to prevent prices from falling. Today the cartel pumps about 17.5 million barrels a day, compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily. In that same period, non-OPEC output has jumped from about 22 million barrels daily to more than 28 million. This year alone, non-OPEC oil output is expected to rise by 800,000 barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output probably will not grow at all. All oil exporters naturally want as high a price for their product as possible. But they seem to have little prospect for overcoming the political and economic differences that make formal cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> hard to achieve. `` There just is n't a community of interest between them,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a London-based oil consultant. `` You're either a member of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> or not; nobody's knocking down the door to join <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Interest of Six-Month Bonds Drops Below 7 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds will earn interest at a rate of 6.90 percent over the next six months, the lowest return in a year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The department said the new rate, which took effect Monday, is down from a 7.17 percent rate of return earned in the last six months and is the lowest rate since savings bonds earned 5.90 percent from May to November of last year. Interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year, on May 1 and Nov. 1, to reflect open market interest rates. The rate is based on 85 percent of the yield on five-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, which have averaged 8.12 percent over the past six months. Since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds in November 1982, the rate of return has averaged 8.5 percent. Investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the average of the half-year rates. In addition, investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate, regardless of what the market rates do. That minimum guaranteed rate is currently 6 percent. But for bonds purchased before Nov. 1, 1986, the minimum is 7.5 percent. <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON>, executive director the savings bond division, predicted that sales would be boosted in the months ahead by a new bonds-by-phone service, which begins Tuesday. Investors can call a toll-free number, 1-800-US-BONDS, and charge the purchase on their VISA or <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> accounts.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities shot up in the government's latest auction with rates on three-month bills climbing to the highest level since the October stock market collapse. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.13 percent on Monday, up from 5.92 percent last week. Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.41 percent, up from 6.28 percent last week. The rates were the highest since three-month bills averaged 6.84 percent on Oct. 19, the day of the stock market collapse, and six-month bills averaged 6.48 percent on Dec. 21. Concerns raised by rising interest rates have been cited as one of the factors contributing to the stock market collapse last fall. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 6.31 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,845.00 and 6.72 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,675.90. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.07 percent last week from 7.03 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>NBC Agrees to Buy Cable Channel, Launch Two New Cable Services</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the nation's top-rated television network, plans a major cable television venture featuring original business and sports programming. The move marks the network's biggest step yet into the cable industry, which it long has eyed as a potential way to complement its over-the-air broadcasting. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary said Monday it had signed a letter of intent to buy a cable television newtork, <ORGANIZATION> Tempo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, and hoped to have new business and sports programming on it later this year or early in 1989. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. `` We believe this is an important step in our efforts to broaden <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s business base,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who for some time has been looking to get the company into cable. Tempo, which is based in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and has about 12 million subscribers, is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area-based company that is the nation's biggest cable television operator. A statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said that in addition to giving up its prospective interest in Tempo, <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to offer the new programming services on its own cable systems and on affiliates that serve 8 million cable subscribers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We feel <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed services will be very appealing options for the cable viewer and believe the rest of the cable industry will be enthusiastic about this opportunity.'' The announcement said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, Tempo and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> hoped to sign final agreements by the end of May. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said, it would discuss affilation agreements for the new programs with other cable operators. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> frequently has expressed an interest in getting the company into cable television since <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> began talks last fall about buying a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> but those negotiations were suspended in January. More recently, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it had informally discussed with <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and other cable operators the possibility of selling broadcast rights to some events in the Summer Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> owns the rights to broadcast the games. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also recently announced it had agreed to produce a new comedy to be aired on the Disney cable channel. This would not be the first corporate link between an over-the-air broadcast network and a cable service. <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, also owns 80 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network. Tempo Television provides programming aimed mainly at viewers over age 45 in four categories _ entertainment, travel, sports-outdoors and how-to information. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans call for it to replace that programming with business and financial news on weekdays and sports programming in the evening and on weekends, according to spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>. The business news and financial information service would present consumer-oriented features and information dealing with the market, business trends and the economy, the announcement said. The sports-programming service would include live and taped coverage of sports events, interviews with sports figures, sports-oriented talk shows and magazine-format sports shows. Both services would rely on existing <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> operations, but would be distinct from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> network programming, <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the venture `` promises to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, thereby preserving our long-term ability to provide first-class programming to our over-the-air broadcast audience.''

 Bargainers for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have returned to national contract talks after settling nagging issues that included the payment of millions of dollars owed to former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said Monday that the union had stalled national contract talks to force the company to settle Wisconsin-worker issues that had been in limbo since <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last August. `` We had to get this piece settled before we could settle the rest,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said. `` ... Now we can get down to the bigger things.'' The national contract covers 66,000 hourly and salaried <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers in 15 states. The two sides tentatively agreed Monday on a separate master pact covering about 7,000 former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. They also reached a four-year local agreement covering 6,500 of the workers, including 5,500 at the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, assembly plant slated for closing and 1,000 at a <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> engine plant that will remain open. The master <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> pact will give <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers about 88 percent, or $ 57 million, of nearly $ 65 million that <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> owed them when it was purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. Workers will receive 100 percent of the money they loaned <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> in concessions in 1982 but will not get interest as <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> had promised, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON>. About 9,000 workers will be eligible for payments averaging $ 6,000 to $ 8,000 apiece, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Steagall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72 representing <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers. Under the same pact, about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> parts depot workers and 425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive most of the more than $ 5 million <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> owed them. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said the master pact also would guarantee laid-off workers six months of supplemental unemployment benefits, which are paid in addition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95 percent of regular pay. Talks on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s national contract, which expires Sept. 14, opened April 18. Last week, the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> talks were moved to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> so bargainers for both sides could negotiate all contracts simultaneously. The tentative <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> local contract appears similar to a five-year agreement reached in October covering Jeep plant workers in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Both pacts give the company more flexibility in using workers. <PERSON> Steagall </PERSON> said about 20 percent of the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers would be able to retire early and laid-off <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers will have first crack at any new jobs at the engine plant there. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreed to negotiate over a new contract five months early _ working under the broad, job-protecting pattern set in contracts in place at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ because of growing friction this year in their working relationship. Sore spots included <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s January announcement of the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> assembly plant closing _ a sudden reversal of promises that the plant would run five more years _ and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s aborted attempt to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreed to early talks in March, but negotiations almost died following last week's announcement of Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s $ 17.9 million 1987 earnings and other executive compensation and confirmation of plans to shift Chrysler K-car production to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in July <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> backed off of the K-car move last week, announcing that production would stay in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> until year's end.

<HEAD>USG Offers Recap As Alternative to Desert Partners Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would take on $ 2.2 billion in new debt under a defensive recapitalization and business restructuring plan it has proposed to counter an unwanted $ 2.32 billion buyout offer by the investment group <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P </ORGANIZATION>. Under its plan, USG would borrow $ 2.2 billion to pay its shareholders $ 37 in cash, debentures with a face value of $ 5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of their 51.5 million common shares, company officials said Monday. USG, a Chicago-based manufacturer of building products, also said it would raise money to pay off the debt by selling its <ORGANIZATION> Masonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kinkead </PERSON> businesses and focusing operations on its core building products businesses. The plan will be submitted June 24 to a vote of shareholders, who also will be asked to rollover certain <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> shares held in company employee benefit plans into new shares of common stock, the company said. As expected, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' reaction was negative. `` From what we have seen, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal appears to be highly conditional and does not have financing in place. We note that USG proposes to move shares into an employee plan,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. `` It's not clear, however, what are the implications of that move with respect to control of the company. We believe that the <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> shareholders might prefer contrary to <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s recap, our fully financed $ 45 per share proposal,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday night. Earlier Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> had tried to lure USG to the bargaining table by offering to increase its bid for the Chicago-based manufacturer to $ 2.32 billion if the two sides can reach a friendly deal. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership headed by two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen, said in a statement that it was willing to pay $ 45 for each of 39 million USG shares if the <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s management agreed to support the offer. The remaining 12.5 million shares would be acquired for subordinated discount debentures carrying a market value of $ 45 each, giving the deal a total value of about $ 2.32 billion. The partnership, led by oilmen <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, previously offered $ 42 a share in a hostile tender offer. That bid, including debt securities and warrants valued at $ 42 each, has a value of about $ 2.2 billion and remains in effect. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> owns about 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s shares and said that as of Friday, about 19.3 million shares, or 37.5 percent, had been tendered under its $ 42-a-share offer. Analysts said that <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' latest proposal was rather conservative and that a bid of $ 50 a share would far more attractive to USG, a manufacturer of paper, plaster and wood products. In takeover overtures last year, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> indicated it was willing to pay $ 50 a share for the company. On composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> rose 50 cents to close at $ 41.50 a share Monday. In proposing a friendly resolution, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' chief financial officer, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, said that `` all aspects of our proposal, including price, are negotiable.'' Among the big bargaining chips <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> executives control is the company's `` poison-pill'' defense, which is designed to hinder an unwanted takeover. Last week a federal judge in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> denied a request from <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to prevent USG from using the defense measure. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it intended to appeal the ruling. `` The poison pill is a way for management to negotiate,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>, a vice president at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` What -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is trying to do is get USG management to negotiate, not to sit there and say the company's not up for sale,'' he added. The standoff appears headed for a showdown at <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting May 11. Desert Partners has nominated a slate of six candidates to <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member board. `` We believe the stockholders will demonstrate their support of good-faith negotiations by voting for the <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> director candidates,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> announced that it has decided to drop its hostile bid for control of the liqueur and luxury products group <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> in the face of a higher offer from <ORGANIZATION> SAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martini </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>. `` After studying the profitability aspects of a higher bid, we have decided to drop out of the running,'' a <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> spokeswoman said Tuesday. `` That leaves <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> as the sole bidder, and we wish them luck.'' <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s decision to give up the bidding came as little surprise to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stock analysts, who had suggested that the French cognac group's heavy debt burden was likely to prevent it from winning a bidding war with the Swiss-based <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>. Under French stock market rules, <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s wholly owned subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Remy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associes </ORGANIZATION> unit would have had to offer at least five percent more per share than <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>'s bid of 7,700 francs, or $ 1,350, to stay in the running. That would have worked out to 8,085 francs, or $ 1,418 dollars, per share, and would have put the minimum cost of a sweetened <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> offer at 1.132 billion francs, or $ 199 million, on the basis of <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION>'s current capital. And if <PERSON> Benedictine </PERSON> carried out a defensive capital boost it had planned to make to friendly institutions, it would have worked out to 1.199 billion francs, or $ 210 million. Benedictine's product range includes peppermint and herbal-flavored liqueurs and anise-flavored apperitifs. The company also has perfume and watch operations.

<HEAD>Boeing In Running For Biggest Jetliner Order Ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s product line is being pitted against a mix of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> planes for what could be the largest single jetliner order ever, industry officials said. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expects to choose next week between 100 and 120 planes in an order expected to exceed $ 4 billion. The <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company buys commercial aircraft to lease to airlines around the world. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Udvar-Hazy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, said quality control at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is a consideration in his company's purchase decisions After complaints recently from <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> `` is working those problems and making corrections,'' he said Monday. An incident in which a section of fuselage ripped away last week on a 737 flying over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> also is a factor, along with economics, <PERSON> Udvar-Hazy </PERSON> said. `` These are all factors. We are looking for the best product, the most reliable and with good economic terms,'' he said. He said his company's board of directors plans to make a decision on the order next Tuesday. Company officials were to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> executives in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> today. `` We like to have the most popular aircraft in the fleet, what airlines demand and what they feel comfortable with,'' <PERSON> Udvar-Hazy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes being considered include the 737-500, 737-300, 737-400, 757-200, 767-300ER and 747-400. <PERSON> Udvar-Hazy </PERSON> said the leasing company also is negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, a European aerospace consortium. It's a `` strong possibility'' the order will be either for all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft or for a split between <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Udvar-Hazy </PERSON> said. He said a three-way deal is `` highly unlikely.'' A $ 4 billion firm order would be larger than any in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> history. The company's largest order was for $ 4.1 billion worth of 747-400 jumbo jets in 1986 from <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, but that included options for 12 planes as well as 16 firm orders. The International Lease fleet is about 70 percent <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, and its customers include both domestic and foreign airlines. Neither <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> nor Airbus alone offers the variety of aircraft sizes and ranges necessary to satisfy <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION>'s airline clients, but together they could produce a selection comparable to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> offering, <PERSON> Udvar-Hazy </PERSON> said. Airbus planes being considered are the A230, A330 and A310 twin jets and the four-engine, long-range A340. St. Louis-based <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> is offering its twin-engine MD-80 and MD-90s series, plus the proposed MD-11 wide-bodied jetliner, which has not yet flown. Some industry analysts said they expected <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to get the nod. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to deliver planes on time is the key factor, they said. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>' production capacity is nowhere near <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s. Last year Airbus produced 32 planes, compared with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 273. `` With the value of the dollar where it is, I do n't see how it -LRB- International Lease -RRB- ca n't not buy <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd-Butler </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` If there is a disadvantage to splitting an order between the three manufacturers, it's also probably true that there's no advantage to splitting it between Airbus and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>First National Bank Sued for Pension Plan Bias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government has filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, charging the bank with discriminating against men and women through various features of its pension plan. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, asks that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> change its pension plans and pay monetary damages to employees. No specific damages were mentioned in the lawsuit, but <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said the amount would be `` very substantial.'' The lawsuit involves one claim of discrimination against men and two against women. The claim of discrimination against men is based on a provision in the pension plans that calculates pension amounts for each employee at retirement using a percentage of that person's earnings. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said the men are credited with a lower percentage than women for employment before 1965. The commission claims that the bank in 1970, in an effort to correct the problem, lowered women's pension benefits to be equal to those of men, a move the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> says is illegal. A third claim involves the use of sex-based mortality tables for calculating pension benefits. The commission said such tables result in lower monthly benefits for women because women retirees on average live longer than men. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said the bank stopped using the sex-based mortality tables about four years ago but did n't change its practices for prior periods of employment.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have rejected a New York-based investor group's bid to replace four company directors and seek to sell the personal care giant, the company reported today. A preliminary count of about 87 million shares voting in the proxy election indicate the four <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> directors received 52 percent support to 48 percent backing the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s slate for the three-year terms, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said it would request a recount. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillete </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 2.25 a share to $ 39 after the announcement. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> launched a proxy battle in February, pledging that if its candidates were elected to the board, it would try to convince the other eight directors to sell Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices held steady in moderate trading, supported somewhat by a firming bond market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.98 to 2,046.25 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 702 issues higher, 456 lower and 545 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 63.71 million shares at midmorning. `` There's not much going on,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Bonds improved today, and that's helping'' stock prices. Trading volume was sluggish partly because because of a delay the opening of the futures pits in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Stock-index futures trading had not yet begun when the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> halted activity after a water main flooded the basement and disrupted telephone contact with the outside world.

<HEAD>China to Start Futures Markets This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plans to open up to five futures markets in the southern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> later this year, becoming the first socialist country to take such a step, according to a report published Tuesday. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed sources as saying preparations were under way to set up three to five pilot markets in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most important business centers. Chinese leaders hope the markets will stabilize the economy and prevent drastic price increases that have become a main complaint of Chinese citizens, the newspaper said. A futures market allows traders and producers to negotiate a set price for what they think a commodity will be worth at a future date. The producer is guaranteed that price regardless of subsequent fluctuations in the market. The report said officials from the cities of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> and the provinces of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hunan </PERSON> met in mid-April to discuss plans for the futures markets, but did not say what commodities would be traded. This is the latest development in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decade-long economic reform that has increasingly turned to capitalistic practices in its attempt to strengthen and enliven the economy. The official Economic Daily earlier this year described how a futures market would solve the problem of gluts and shortages, which often are the result of farmers' inability to forecast the market. Both papers acknowledged that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s backward communications and transport systems will be a problem, but the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said, `` ... The country can not wait until everything is ready before carrying out the plans.'' The paper said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leaders want to learn from the experience of foreign countries in futures markets and that experts from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will be consulted. It said no decision has been made yet on whether foreigners will be allowed to trade in the markets.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Sues Insurers Over Pollution Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has filed suit against at least 115 of its insurers in an effort to force them to provide coverage for cleanup, legal and study costs stemming from pollution sites around the country. The chemical giant filed two suits last week, one in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, where it is based, and the other in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> did n't disclose how much money it has spent on pollution defense or cleanup, and company spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameele </PERSON> would n't say. Defendants in the suits include <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. There are also unnamed defendants in the suits. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesler </PERSON>, a company attorney in <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> still has n't determined all of the insurance carriers that provided coverage. Some of the pollution occurred at Union Carbide plants, while other problems cited in the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> suit stem from the company's disposal of its wastes at other sites. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> suit, the company seeks coverage for seven pollution sites in that state. The sites were identified by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and state environmental departments. None are in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the insurance companies declined to comment on the suits, citing company policies on not discussing matters that are in litigation. Union Carbide is among a growing number of companies suing their insurers over whether liability policies cover contamination of property and groundwater due to seepage of hazardous wastes. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, recently sued more than 240 of its insurers from the past 37 years to obtain coverage for 134 pollution sites. The <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> suit seeks insurance for sites or situations including: _ Three pesticide dumping sites in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where Union Carbide shipped hazardous wastes from 1962 to 1970 _ The <PERSON> Laskin </PERSON> landfill in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> sent 60,000 to 70,000 gallons of waste oil from 1976 through 1981 _ The Northside landfill in <LOCATION> Zionsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, to which <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> sent 1.8 million gallons of calcium silicate and asbestos from 1974 to 1980 _ Union Carbide's plant in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which made phel, a strong, corrosive, poison, from 1951 to 1971 _ Union Carbide's plant in <LOCATION> Yabucoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where graphite electrodes are made _ A suit charged that the pesticide <PERSON> Temik </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldicarb </PERSON>, made by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, polluted residential wells after it was applied to potato fields in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, from 1975 through 1979 A settlement was reached in 1984 and the new suit does n't give details. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> says it continues to incur costs for testing, monitoring and legal fees. _ Contamination of soil and groundwater from uranium milling at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Uravan </ORGANIZATION> site in <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, from 1923 to 1984 The company signed an agreement last year to pay the state $ 2.8 million.

<TEXT>
 It looked like the movie `` Wall Street.'' Brokers wearing yellow `` yuppie'' ties, waving I.D. tags and shouting into walkie-talkies, jostled one another to make bids on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But the object of the bidding was not stocks, bonds, commodities or precious metals. It was part of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s mountainous foreign debt of $ 121 billion. Thoughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which as a whole owes the rest of the world $ 410 billion and has been unable to pay it back, so-called `` debt-for-equity swaps'' are being tried as a way to break the impasse. Not everyone is enthusiastic about the idea, which involves trading big debts for generally smaller amounts of equity in local enterprises. Some countries say the swaps cause inflation and lead to `` foreign domination'' of their economies. Some major creditor banks, mostly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ones, which sank billions into Latin loans, say the swaps force them to cancel their debt at too hefty a discount. On the other hand, many small banks _ in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities such as <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> _ see the swaps as a way to salvage at least some of the money they sunk into the region in the 1970s. `` Swaps will never be a total solution to the debt crisis. But they certainly are a step in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> Maarten </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pronk </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> representative of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, currently the world's No. 1 middleman in debt-for-equity trades. `` There are pluses and minuses on both sides, but the overall result is very interesting.'' In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which has just begun monthly debt auctions, equity trades could reduce the country's foreign debt by as much as $ 4 billion this year, officials estimate. In a typical transaction, a company hoping to start or expand a Brazilian business purchases a certain amount of the country's debt from a creditor bankat a steep discount and then brings that debt to market to bid against other companies on a repayment plan from the central bank of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Successful bidders _ the ones who accept the biggest discounts from the central bank _ get repaid in local currency, which is to be invested in their local enterprises. The benefit to the companies comes in the difference between what they paid for the debt and what the central bank agrees to repay them. For example, a company might purchase debt at 50 cents on the dollar and then win a bid of 70 cents on the dollar from the central bank in the auction. The government regulates the auctions, screens the types of projects to be funded and sets quotas on the amount of debt it will repay. While the process helps ease the national debt burden, the regulations are designed to control the inflationary effects of the swaps, which infuse the economy with fresh capital and increase the money in circulation. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, like most other countries, also protects its end of the deal by requiring investors to keep their assets in the country for a period of years. `` The Rio debt auction was a complete success,'' <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcellos </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. Another aggressive debt swapper is <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which still owes an estimated $ 21.7 billion but has traded off $ 3 billion worth. Thanks to such deals, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Australian, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> private interests have bought into Chilean mining companies, private pension funds, fruit-growing firms and fishing companies. Some critics complain that encouraging foreign interests to swap debt for equity could lead to a `` denationalization'' of the Latin American economy. But in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the authoritarian regime of President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> says the swaps will continue, especially since the country is writing off debt at the rate of 59 to 61 cents on the dollar. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the No. 2 Third World debtor owing $ 105 billion, swapped some $ 2 billion of debt for local assets but stopped the program last year when the inflation rate hit a record 159.2 percent. Under the Mexican swaps, made at a discount of around 30 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Med </ORGANIZATION> acquired or increased holdings in the country. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, third among Latin debtors with $ 55 billion owed, this year held two debt-for-equity auctions and authorized 15 specific debt-swap deals. In these projects, $ 241 million worth of debt is to be canceled in exchange for $ 139 million worth of ownership in two breweries, a soft drink bottling plant, a beer bottling company, an auto parts firm and a manufacturer of insulin. But <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciminari </PERSON>, the secretary of industry and foreign trade, echoed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s worries about inflation. With <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s inflation rate running over 200 percent a year, the swap program could get tripped up, he said. Small, poor <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has succeeded in reducing its $ 900 million debt to foreign banks by swapping part of it for local assets _ at the bargain-basement rate of 11 cents on the dollar. But there is controversy, because of fear foreigners will gain control of traditionally state-run companies. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has gone timidly into debt swaps. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> says it intends to start them. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> have n't shown much interest in such operations, while <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which has openly refused to repay most of its $ 16.7 billion debt, does n't consider swaps at all. Also generally in the anti-swap camp are the giant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks that tied up billions of dollars in Latin American loans. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> are, in principle, against huge discounts on the money owed to them.

 Farmers around the country are out kicking the tires on new tractors again, and equipment sales are rebounding from post-Depression lows so quickly many manufacturers are having trouble keeping up. `` The situation has changed dramatically,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Unverferth </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Unverferth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Kalida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, company that makes tillage and grain-handling equipment and special farm vehicle wheels. `` It went from a pretty sick apple to one where we're on overtime and have been on overtime for quite a while,'' said <PERSON> Unverferth </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a 330-member trade group of small manufacturers. While manufacturers anticipated an upswing with an improved farm economy, most misjudged its size and momentum. `` I never thought things would turn around to this magnitude this quickly,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON>, who runs a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, company that makes tillage and planting equipment. `` I thought it would be a gradual turnaround, something you could adjust to,'' he said. `` We went from moderate production to extremely heavy production. `` Unless something happens to change things drastically in the next six weeks, this could be a record year in sales for this company,'' <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> said. The sales spurt has left farmers waiting months for new tractors and equipment as manufacturers attempt to fill an unexpected backlog of orders. Steel has become a precious metal because of the manufacturing push. Prices are up 20 percent to 45 percent for some tubing and steel bars that are in short supply. Machinery makers also report problems getting bearings. In addition to farmer income, factors propelling the surge include a nearly depleted inventory of good used equipment, better commodity prices, stronger export sales of grain and a continuing moderation of interest expenses and costs for fuel, fertilizer and other materials. <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> monthly sales surveys show a strong recovery. In March, manufacturers sold 9,876 tractors compared with 7,712 the same month a year earlier. For the first quarter of this year, 22,986 tractors have been sold compared with 18,061 in the same period a year ago. Sales of combines and hay and forage equipment also are up sharply in the first quarter. After record or near-record sales in the late 1970s as farmers expanded their operations, equipment manufacturers and dealers were hit hard when the farm recession began. During the early 1980s, many farmers quit buying new equipment and either made used equipment purchases or just tried to get by with additional maintenance or repair. Dozens of little companies that made specialized machinery folded or scrambled to get into other product areas. Even the big manufacturers were hard hit. A hallowed name in agricultural equipment for decades, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, sold its farm machinery division to J.I. Case in 1984 so it could concentrate on making more profitable heavy trucks. At <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 ag equipment maker in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, farm machinery sales peaked in 1981. When they began declining, company profits followed. In fiscal 1986, <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> lost $ 229 million, its first loss since the Great Depression. As the slump bottomed out, sales and manufacturing capacity dipped to around 50 percent of previous levels, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebbinghaus </PERSON>, vice president of the Farm and <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The institute represents large manufacturers who provide more than 90 percent of all the farm equipment and machinery made nationwide. `` About a year ago things started to turn around,'' <PERSON> Ebbinghaus </PERSON> said. `` Sales stopped their decline and leveled off or started back up.'' He said by the end of 1987, early-year losses had been recouped and the industry stood about even with its position at the end of 1986. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> economists are predicting a modest increase in sales during 1988. `` The big news is there is n't expected to be a decline for the first time in several years,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist. Preliminary USDA statistics show 1987 was the eighth consecutive year of declining farm equipment expenditures. But when final figures are released in July, they are expected to show a less severe decrease than in previous years, <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON> said. He and other ag economists say the improvement in net farm cash income _ the difference between gross income and expenses _ finally is affecting equipment sales. For two years or more, farmers who saw their incomes improve have used the money to pay off debts, most economists agree. The outlook of many farmers began changing about eight months ago, according to economists and other equipment industry analysts. `` It's as positive now as it's been in a long period of time,'' <PERSON> Ebbinghaus </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> broke a string of five straight quarterly losses in the second quarter of fiscal 1987. The company has n't had a losing quarter since and it has been calling back laid-off workers. `` We expect the recovery to continue,'' said <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Alm </PERSON>. `` We have what we call ` cautious optimism.' We've been through so much for so long we almost do n't want to get too excited too soon.''

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting a variety of weather information, analysts said. Beneficial rain fell overnight in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and extreme southwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and was headed today for central and southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The improvement in growing conditions lent a weaker tone to corn futures. But longer-range forecasts predicted dryness and below-normal temperatures in the east, and moisture and above-normal temperatures in the west. `` It's indecisive at this point,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Generally, rain is needed in the east. They've been having some moisture in the west.'' The long-term outlook for grain and soybean prices remained bullish, however, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` I think we're going to gyrate back and forth and consolidate the recent big gains before ultimately moving higher,'' he said. In early trading, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 4 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.02 a bushel; corn was \ cent to -RCB- cent lower with May at $ 2.04 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.61 a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at $ 6.89 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after opening about 2 -LCB- hours late due to flooding in the exchange's telcommunications room. Live cattle were unchanged to .40 cent higher with June at 71.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .30 cent higher with May at 79 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 49.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to .10 cent lower with May at 51.90 cents a pound. Feeder cattle settled mostly lower Monday. Other livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Requires Reports on Program Trades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday began requiring members to submit daily reports of their program trades, a move designed to help the exchange analyze market volatility. Under the new rule, <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> members and member firms must submit a log of program trades made for customers or for their own accounts, including trades executed in other markets, by the close of the second business day following the trades, the exchange said in a statement. Members are not required, however, to identify customers for whom program trades were executed. Program trading has been blamed for much of the market volatility at the time of the October stock market crash. The submission of daily data will `` enable the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> to more routinely monitor and analyze program trading activity.'' Analysts were not surprised by the new rule, which had been announced previously. `` It's going to require more forms, more paperwork, more time, and it's going to cost money,'' noted <ORGANIZATION> Perrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. But many said they support the move. `` It's a good idea because a lot of movement in the market is attributed to program trading that is n't,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Twenty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He hopes the rule will dispell some concern over program trading activity. Analysts agree a separate possibility under consideration that would require members to identify within 48 hours all customers for whom any business was conducted has far more serious implications. `` That proposal will come up against a great deal of resistance,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>State Oil Regulator Wants To Keep OPEC Contacts Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' three oil regulators, says the state benefited from his attendance at last week's <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting, and he plans to keep those contacts open despite the criticism the trip drew. `` We're not trying to join <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, and we're not always going to agree with them,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, who sits on the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` But when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried to get nuclear arms stability, he had to deal with the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, who are our enemies.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> did not participate in meetings held by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, but rather visited with some individual oil ministers during his stay in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` The critical thing is _ we're living in a world where someone else sets the price for our commodity. We have to have input,'' he said in an interview Monday. Not everyone agreed. One group called Monday for <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> to be prosecuted on charges of violating the Logan Act, which bans private citizens from interfering with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which says it has 12 million members who favor low energy prices, wrote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> urging that he prosecute <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>. `` It would appear that Commissioner <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>'s efforts to assist <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in fixing world oil prices are in direct opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign and economic policy,'' the letter said. `` Commissioner <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> is carrying on a blatant campaign to assist <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in raising world oil prices and damaging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic interests.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting ended Monday with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut in the group's oil production, a move aimed at stabilizing prices that have undergone big fluctuations since late 1985. The proposal was made after six non-OPEC oil countries offered to reduce their production if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> made a similar cut. `` I am disappointed that ... they did not reach an agreement.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said. `` I figured that if they did n't, prices would slide a little temporarily and then they would come back.'' Despite the meeting's breakdown, however, <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said he agreed with predictions that world oil prices would stabilize near recent levels. In fact, prices did take a hard fall amid market disappointment at the meeting's failure _ but not low enough to match levels that existed before the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> session was called early last month. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, for example, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 85 cents a barrel to $ 17.14 Monday. In early April, it had traded in high $ 16 range. For 40 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> helped set world oil prices. The commission has monitored oil output since an oil price crash in the 1930s, and under state law the agency has authority to restrict production to avoid waste and to protect reserves. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> made no apologies for his trip, which also drew criticism from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials should attend the next <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> session in June because `` what happens in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings will have more impact on our economy than anything that will happen in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> invited <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s president, plus oil officials from several other nations, to visit <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and learn more about the <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s production monitoring system. `` <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is coming Wednesday,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s president or his representative likely would visit the state this summer

Ms. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, representatives of consumer groups and some plaintiff lawyers linked to <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> lawsuits and <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' reorganization called for rejection of the plan, which was mailed to claimants last week. The proposal includes <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' merger with New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a Dalkon Shield trust fund of at least $ 2.475 billion. <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> expressed puzzlement at the opposition. `` Our view is that we have a consensus of all the groups involved in the case,'' he said. `` The reason for that is this plan is fair.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, who is overseeing <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' Chapter 11 reorganization in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in December placed the $ 2.475 billion value on an estimated 195,000 Dalkon Shield claims before the court. `` It is important to remember that Judge <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> has said that the Dalkon Shield trust fund represents more money than anyone ever thought would be available,'' <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> said. A letter mailed by the claimants' committee to women who contend they were injured by the birth control device said that `` as a result of interest earnings, the funds available under the plan to pay <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claims and expenses will exceed $ 2.475 billion. ... We recommend that you vote to accept the plan of reorganization.'' `` The plan is not perfect,'' the letter said. `` However, on balance, the plan offers claimants the most money and the best terms that could be achieved without a long and uncertain legal fight. `` This is an opportunity to receive compensation for your claim sooner and with greater certainty than if we were to continue the litigation,'' the committee's letter said. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, a pharmaceutical manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, sold the intrauterine device in the the early 1970s. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in August 1985 as lawsuits mounted against the Dalkon Shield.

 Stock prices advanced today, supported by heavy dividend-related trading, activity in takeover issues and a firmer bond market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 16.41 to 2,059.68 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 859 issues higher, 588 lower and 502 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 149.54 million shares one hour before the close. Much of the session's activity centered on heavy trading in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, which goes ex-dividend today. The stock led the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s most-active list, rising \ to 27 -RRB-, and accounted for about a third of total volume. `` Without that, volume would be extraordinarily low,'' noted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Takeover stocks were driving the rest of the market, `` whether they're real or imagined,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Without takeover and ex-dividend issues, however, trading was listless. `` We're basically in a trendless market that is drifting upward,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. `` Everybody is waiting for something to get this market out of its six-week-old lethargy.'' A strengthening dollar and firming bond prices helped support stock prices at their current levels, analysts said. Program traders were shut out of the market in the early going because of a water main break at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index are traded. Activity was halted for more than two and a half hours. Some analysts welcomed the respite. On Wall Street, `` it's a refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino,'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said. Arbitragers remained mostly on the sidelines once futures activity resumed, analysts said.

 Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> moved to put his stamp on the nation's mail Tuesday, juggling <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> managers and turning his personal attention to technology and planning. `` Change is inevitable. If we are to be successful, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service must anticipate change and manage it effectively,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> told the opening session of the Third Conference on Advanced Technology. Postal managers from around the world convened at the session to see the latest in sorting and canceling machines, lasers that read ZIP codes and even automated postal clerks. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who brought automated bank tellers to supermarkets and discount stores when he headed a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan association, told the conference that he hopes to do the same for the postal system. `` We plan to locate automated postal tellers in high traffic areas like shoping malls, transportation stations and large office buildings,'' he said. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, known for his hands-on management style as a banker before taking over leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on March 1, told the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> that he is separating the finance and planning divisions. He named <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> as assistant postmaster general for planning, and said <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> will report directly to him on projects for the development and improvement of the agency. The Postal Service announced, meanwhile, that it suffered a loss of $ 635 million for the accounting period from Dec. 19 to March 11, above the $ 586 million deficit it had predicted for that period. Higher postage rates intended to put the service back in the black took effect April 3. At its meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> also disclosed that it has rejected a proposal to offer a lower `` bill-payer'' postage rate. That idea had been suggested by the independent <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. It proposed a discount for people using pre-printed reply envelopes, such as those for use paying bills, which are addressed to a post office box. Such envelopes do save the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> money, primarily because they go to a box rather than having to be delivered to a customer, the board said. But the governors concluded that the bill-payer rate would be unfair to others sending mail to post office boxes, since they would still have to pay the full rate. In other personnel moves, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> broadened the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s top management by naming two associate postmasters general to work with him and Deputy Postmaster General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> was promoted to associate for systems, succeeding the late <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Acord </PERSON> who died earlier this year. This includes responsibility for personnel, marketing, communications, facilities and procurement. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has been in charge of facilities, was given the newly created position of associate postmaster general for international affairs. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> will launch the new job by coordinating the 1989 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the international group that coordinates mail service between nations. It will be the organization's first meeting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 92 years. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief, announced that consumer advocate <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s duties will be expanded to include measurement of postal performance. In addition, he named <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> to head administrative services and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> as acting head of marketing and communications.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in an see-saw session influenced by conflicting interpretations of long-range weather forecasts. `` If we had closed 15 minutes earlier, we would have closed higher,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's just been back and forth all day long.'' Forecasts called for beneficial rains Tuesday in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and extreme southwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and a good chance for rain Wednesday in central and southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Those forecasts gave the markets their negative tone. But six-to-10 day forecasts called for dryness and below-normal temperatures in the east with wetter weather and above-normal temperatures in the west. Traders had a hard time deciding whether the long-range forecasts implied better or worse growing conditions, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` The weather is ambiguous and the market reflected that ambiguity today,'' he said. At the close, wheat was -LCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 2.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with May at $ 2.04 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.57 \ a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 6.89 a

<HEAD>Gillette Announces Narrow Victory In Proxy Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that its shareholders narrowly rejected a bid by a group of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investors to replace four company directors and seek a buyer for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s global personal care empire. Analysts said most of the support for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> came from individual shareholders interested in retaining a stable investment and confused by the lack of definite sale plan by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. A preliminary count of about 87 million shares voting in the proxy election indicate that the four <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> directors received 52 percent support, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said. It said that tally exceeded the 48 percent of shareholder votes backing <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of directors for the three-year terms. The announcement culminates a proxy battle launched in February by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which pledged to convince the other eight directors to sell <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> if its candidates were elected to the board. Possible suitors included <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which ended a series of takeover attempts in 1986 after <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> paid about $ 580 million to repurchase its shares. The proxy ballots were submitted during <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s April 21 annual meeting in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. After the ballots were cast both sides had claimed victory, with <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> noting support from many large institutional shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> vowed Tuesday to immediately file a recount request, saying their ballot projections were higher. `` We submitted a lot more votes than we seem to be getting credit for,'' said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. `` It puzzles us, and we'll try to figure out exactly how many people were on our side.'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> attorneys may request a new election as part of the `` equitable relief'' sought in a countersuit filed last month in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> claiming <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> issued false and misleading statements about <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> during the three-month proxy battle. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled Wednesday before Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>, who previously refused to issue a temporary restraining order to block <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s proxy slate. In a suit filed last month, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> failed to fully disclose all its financial backers in documents submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a prepared statement Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Colman </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the outcome shows shareholder support for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s performance since a 1986 restructuring, which included 2,400 layoffs and sale of several unprofitable divisions. At the annual meeting, several shareholders lauded <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> management's long-term plans and questioned <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s ultimate intentions. `` <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> never really had any definite plan on the table,'' said <PERSON> Pavlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrakis </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There were no real buyers and no tender offer made. All they were saying is that we'll have four people on a 12-member board and we'll have some clout.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said most shareholders are reluctant to give up their investment in <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, which produces steady stock dividends. `` Here's a company with an annual growth rate of about 10 percent and stockholders do not want to give that up for a one-time cash payment,'' said Winter. `` Institutional investors, on the other hand, are looking for a profit each quarter ...'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified investment firm, controls 6.76 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's 115.5 million shares outstanding. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> forced a major restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> following a takeover attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said the company has no comment on reports that officials had conducted negotiations with several potential buyers. As a way to dilute the influence of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s slate, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> on April 20 amended its bylaws to increase the number of directors needed to call a special meeting from two to seven.

 Trading halted for more than 2 -LCB- hours Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after water from a burst pipe flooded the exchange's telecommunications room, disabling its automated price quotation system. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is the leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for stock-index and livestock futures, and the trading shutdown had a quieting effect on the nation's other financial markets, analysts said. `` We do n't know what caused it but it leaked a whole lot of water,'' exchange spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said after trading resumed at 10:45 a.m. CDT. Exchange officials called the trading halt at 8:05 a.m. CDT., 45 minutes after the opening of trading in foreign currency and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill futures Trading in stock-index and agricultural futures had not yet opened when the halt was called, <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said. A large water pipe in the sprinkler system burst and flooded the second-floor telecommunications room, located just below the exchange's trading floor, he said. The water disabled the exchange's high-speed telephone lines, which carry price quotes to subscribers of market-information services around the world. The exchange's computers were not damaged, so trading could have continued but `` the customers and users of the market would n't have known what the prices were,'' <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said. During the trading halt, stock market players were unable to hedge their equity investments via the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s popular <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 futures contract. That may have limited trading activity on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. `` You're definitely not going to see anybody make a big play without the futures open,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> LNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. While the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> was down, he said, `` There was one or two things less to watch on what was a quiet day to begin with.'' <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said it was impossible to calculate the dollar value of the loss of volume at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MidAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which trades smaller versions of the most popular futures contracts offered by other exchanges, may have benefited from the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s problems, however. Spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Murschel </PERSON> said the MidAm halted trading in its stock-index, livestock, foreign currency and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill futures at the same time as the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, then resumed trading in those contracts at 10 a.m. CDT when it appeared the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> might be closed for a day or more. `` When the MidAm reopened, it really became the marketplace for those contracts that were affected by the <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION>, so there was an alternative marketplace available,'' <PERSON> Murschel </PERSON> said. `` It was the MidAm's day in the sun.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Tuesday asked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to protect American intellectual property rights and lift sales restrictions on foreign cigarettes, government officials said.

<HEAD>Kodak Reports $260 Million in Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 46 percent in the first quarter of 1988, to $ 260 million from $ 178 million a year ago, the company said Tuesday. The photographic giant said the increase was due to increases in sales volume, the weak dollar, and earnings from <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> acquired in February. On a per share basis, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> earned 80 cents in the first three months of the year, compared to 53 cents during the first quarter of 1987. Sales increased 25 percent to $ 3.33 billion from $ 2.65 billion last year. Analysts said the results were better than expected. The only surprise in the report was a 2 percent earnings drop in the company's imaging segment, which includes photography and copiers, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the decline was due to repackaging of certain film products and increased advertising expenses. He said, however, the expenditures would pay off later. Another analyst, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said a large portion of the per share earnings increase, 27 cents, was due to the declining value of the dollar, which makes foreign profits worth more in dollar terms. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said it was a `` low quality source'' of earnings gain. He said the sale of assets in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> resulted in another 4 cents of the per-share gain. Both analysts noted strong gains in the company's chemicals segment and the Sterling Drug subsidiary. Sales rose in each of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s three segments. Sales in its imaging segment were $ 2 billion, up from $ 1.8 billion last year. Chemical sales were $ 654 million, up from $ 588 million. And sales in health products were $ 640 million, up from $ 274 million. Sales outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were healthy _ up 23 percent in the imaging segment, up 16 percent in chemicals, and up 104 percent in health.

<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday its board rejected a sweetened $ 1.42 billion takeover bid from British sugar producer <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and may consider other offers. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said several unidentified `` third parties'' are interested in acquiring the company, based in this northwest <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` The company is continuing discussions with certain third parties and expects to enter into negotiations,'' <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said in a statement issued by the company. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> shares advanced 50 cents to $ 38.375. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s board recommended that the company's stockholders reject the $ 35-a-share bid, which was made last week and approved Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> shareholders meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. When it first moved to take over <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> last month, the British company offered $ 32 per share of common stock. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' second-larged refiner of corn sweeteners behind Decatur-based <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, urged its stockholders April 21 to reject the first offer. In its statement Tuesday, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> said its financial advisers _ <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> _ had concluded the revised <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> offer was `` inadequate.'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s board did not make a recommendation on <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s offers of $ 53.15 a share for depositary preferred stock or $ 105 a share for cumulative preference stock. But the company's statement noted the British company's takeover bid was conditioned on receiving a minimum number of common-stock shares and that <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s board has recommended rejecting the common stock bid. In a related matter, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s board extended its `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defense until May 10 at 5 p.m. Tate's revised bid expires at midnight -LRB- EDT -RRB- on that date. Spokesmen for the companies did not return telephone messages Tuesday seeking comment. But industry analysts have said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> has a fair market value of about $ 40 a share. After <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s first offer, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that if he were a <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> stockholder, he probably would n't sell for less than $ 40. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> owns about 5 percent of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s stock and wants to acquire the entire company for its A.E. <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> was based in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, until about three years ago when it moved its headquarters to <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION>. The British company has promised to move <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s headquarters back to the central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city if its takeover succeeds. <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> CFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading food-service supplier.

 The dollar rose narrowly on domestic markets but fell overseas Tuesday with little news to influence trading. Gold prices slipped. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 443.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 445 at the same time Monday. `` It is a very sleepy, featureless market,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior foreign exchange trader with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. There were few developments to sway trading, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. However, one trader said the dollar managed a late rally because of rumors of buying interest among Japanese investors. Overseas trading was subdued because markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were closed for a national holiday. Dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the dollar would likely continue to fluctuate within a narrow range at least until the scheduled release Friday of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment data. The market also looked ahead to the May 17 release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade figures for March, dealers said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound edged up to $ 1.8715 from $ 1.8645. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound slipped to $ 1.86825 from $ 1.87225 late Monday. The dollar was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 124.83 Japanese yen, down from 125.33 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 125.155 yen from 124.825 yen late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.67955 West German marks, up from 1.67825; 1.39875 Swiss francs, up from 1.39735; 5.7105 French francs, up from 5.7000; 1,249.375 Italian lire, up from 1,1248.83; and 1.23575 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23255.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Sturgis, Deadlocked On Others In Continental Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury acquitted an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> oil contractor Tuesday on charges of scheming to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but failed to reach a verdict on two bank executives charged in the case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> declared a mistrial after jurors said they were `` hopelessly deadlocked.'' The government maintained during the 6 -LCB- - week trial that former banker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> manipulated his two debt-plagued co-defendants, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, in a scheme involving high-risk energy loans to save his own failing bank by defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> But the panel found <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, an independent oil contractor from <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, innocent of wire-fraud charges. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> were charged with wire fraud and misapplication of funds. Continental came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part because of troubled energy loans, but the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank survived with help from a $ 4.5 billion federal rescue plan. `` What can I say? The dream came true,'' <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> said after the innocent verdict was read. `` I'm getting on the first plane'' back to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president who headed the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank's energy-lending division, said, `` I am very disappointed -LRB- about the mistrial -RRB-. I had hoped for a resolution.'' Outside the courtroom neither <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> until its collapse in 1982, nor his lawyer, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>, had anything to say to reporters. But in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Burck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, said he also was disappointed. `` We were hopeful that the jury would return a verdict of not guilty, but of course, we're pleased on the other hand that there was no guilty verdict returned,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said he would huddle for a few days with assistant prosecutors <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotert </PERSON> before deciding whether to seek another trial. `` When the jury speaks, we respect the verdict,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` We sent up the best trial lawyers to try an extraordinarily complex case. They did a good job. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Streiker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s attorney, said, `` There's a good possibility there will be a retrial.'' The case went to the jury April 26 and jurors began their fifth day of deliberations shortly after 9 a.m. EDT Tuesday. Federal prosecutors had contended <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> was the central figure in the alleged fraud scheme and controlled <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, who were financially dependent on him and <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> for loans. The government charged that <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, caught in spiraling personal debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, accepted kickbacks from <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION> in exchange for funding or attempting to fund high-risk energy loans from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> customers between July 1981 and July 1982. The indictment cited <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s involvement in $ 44 million in loans made by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to 12 Penn Square customers, many without any documentation. It did not say how much eventually was recovered by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank. Attorneys for <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> had argued that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy, not because of a fraud scheme. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> were accused of engaging in a related `` buyback'' investment scheme that began with <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> buying into <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>' operations in May 1981. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> bought <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> out less than a year later at triple the original investment to improve his chances of getting a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> loan through the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> banker, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> arranged for a $ 3 million loan to <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> that enabled him to buy out <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s $ 150,000 investment for $ 475,000, the government said. The `` buy-back'' scheme was devised as a way for <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> to clear much of his personal debt and for <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, who was then being pursued by creditors over $ 100 million in business loans, to find a new lending source, prosecutors said in closing arguments.

<HEAD>Gold Falls To 6-Week Low; Drop To $400 Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices dipped to their lowest levels in more than six weeks Tuesday, bolstering bearish projections and prompting speculation that the metal's price could tumble as low as $ 400 a troy ounce in coming months. On other markets, energy futures rallied, cattle futures climbed while pork futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were lower and stock-index futures advanced. It was not the depth of gold's decline but the fact that it fell at all that analysts found remarkable. Oil prices rallied Tuesday and inflation-sensitive gold would ordinarily have done the same. `` I've been saying gold is in a bear market and today's action certainly proves it,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodity trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Joesphthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We could have had an up day with the price of oil rebounding, but the market just ignored that and traded on its own.'' Gold settled $ 2.10 lower across the board on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in June at $ 445.10 a troy ounce, the lowest price for a lead futures contract since March 17, when the April contract settled at $ 444.90 The overall strength of the economy and the fading prospects for higher inflation have the precious metals markets on the defensive, analysts said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> called Tuesday's trading `` another small disaster'' for both gold and silver futures. `` This is sort of a continuation of what has been a steady erosion over the last couple of months in both of these markets,'' he said. Silver settled 5 cents to 5.5 cents lower with May at $ 6.298 a troy ounce. Energy futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a technical recovery from Monday's plunge, which had been a reaction to the failure of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers to agree on production cuts, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 26 cents higher with June at $ 17.37 a barrel; heating oil was .09 cent lower to .82 cent higher with June at 46.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .75 cent to .91 cent higher with June at 50.28 cents a gallon. Cattle futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while pork futures were mixed. The cattle market is struggling between the reality of high cash prices and the implication of recent government reports that large numbers of cattle are being fattened for slaughter, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Hog futures were caught Tuesday between the higher cattle futures prices and sharply lower pork-belly futures linked to a glut of frozen bellies, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. The opening of livestock trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was delayed about 2 -LCB- hours Tuesday when water from a burst pipe flooded the exchange's telecommunications room, forcing a halt to trading. Live cattle settled .43 cent to .92 cent higher with June at 71.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .93 cent higher with May at 79.45 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .33 cent higher with June at 49.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .85 cent lower with May at 51.25 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in an up-and-down session influenced by conflicting interpretations of long-range weather forecasts, analysts said. Forecasts called for beneficial rains Tuesday in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and extreme southwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and a good chance for rain Wednesday in central and southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Those forecasts gave the markets their negative tone. But six-to-10 day forecasts called for dryness and below-normal temperatures in the east with wetter weather and above-normal temperatures in the west. Traders had a hard time deciding whether the long-range forecasts implied better or worse growing conditions, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.97 -RCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with May at $ 2.04 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.57 \ a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 6.89 \ Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's stock index settled 1 point higher at 262.70.

 The stock market gained ground Tuesday, largely on the strength of takeover issues and heavy dividend-related trading in one stock. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.09 to close at 2,058.36. The key index rose nearly 11 points in the previous session. Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 897 issues up, 580 down and 513 unchanged. Broader market gauges also advanced. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 176.92 million shares, against 136.47 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index rose 0.74 to 148.57. Much of the session's activity centered on heavy trading in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, which went ex-dividend Tuesday. The stock led the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s most-active list, rising -LRB- to 27 \, and accounted for about a quarter of total trading volume Takeover speculation, for `` real or imaginary'' reasons, drove trading in a handful of other blue-chip issues, noted <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. In addition to being fueld by the rumor mill, analysts said takeover issues heated up in anticipation that cash will soon be freed up from other deals. As the takeovers of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and textile giant <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> move toward settlements, funds are likely to flow into other `` possible deal-type'' stocks, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, chief market strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` This is going to free up a lot of capital that will find its way back to the arbitrage circuit,'' he said. Despite the rather narrow focus of activity, analysts noted that the market's overall tone is improving. `` The Dow has been producing much more encouraging technical signs that suggest we are going to work higher,'' <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON> said. Program traders were shut out of the market in the early going because of a water main break at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index are traded. Activity was halted for more than two and a half hours. Some analysts welcomed the absence of program plays. `` It's a refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Arbitragers remained mostly on the sidelines once futures activity resumed, analysts said. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> climbed 3 -LRB- to 44 | on news that the company has offered a $ 45-per-share restructuring in response to advances by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> was off 1 -RRB- to 39 ~ The company said a preliminary report shows its slate of candidates won board seats in a proxy fight waged by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to challenge the count. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 -RCB- to 26 | following reports that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> family may be considering making a bid for the computer <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> jumped 3 \ to 60 -LCB- on speculation that the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, which has filed to acquire up to 15 percent of the retailer, was buying shares <ORGANIZATION> Gould </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which announced an asset sale as part of a new restructuring, was up 2 to 13 -RRB-. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 13.917 billion, or 0.53 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 201.9 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.76 to 306.70, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.44 at 263.00.

<HEAD>Koppers Attorneys Accuse Shearson Of Using Inside Information</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday of improperly trading <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock on the basis of inside information about the $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>. A court document filed by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> brokers accumulated <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock from January through early March for managed discretionary customer accounts. During the same period, which ended the day before the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group announced a buyout offer, large amounts of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock were sold for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> discretionary accounts and for discretionary and managed discretionary accounts of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> unit. `` Based on information disclosed, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s managed accounts performed as if they had a pipeline directly into the tender offer,'' the attorneys said in court documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` It is factually obvious that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s preferential customers were enriched at the expense of all other discretionary accounts,'' the documents stated. The allegations were included in a motion filed in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' federal suit to block the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group's takeover attempt. <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, has offered $ 60 a share to acquire the Pittsburgh-based chemical and construction company. The investor group owns or has been tendered about 66 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> outstanding common shares, but is barred from purchasing the tendered stock by two injunctions issued by federal judges in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Eastern Seeks Clarification of Order Barring Shuttle Sale</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has asked a federal judge to clarify his order barring the financially troubled carrier from selling its Northeast shuttle service to another subsidiary of its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is investigating Machinist union charges that the Miami-based carrier is guessing the weight of cargo aboard its aircraft. `` We've been looking into the allegations for about a week and a half,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We have not found any irregularities yet.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has already fined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> $ 823,500 for safety violations and is conducting an inspection of its fleet. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the airline `` is absolutely safe in all phases of its operations'' and accused the Machinists of using safety issues as a smokescreen to obscure economic issues in contract negotiations. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the motion by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which was filed last week under seal in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, appears to have been made in an attempt to ensure that a planned business transaction would not violate a series of orders issued by District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>. In March, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> held <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in contempt of a July 2, 1987, order issued in a labor dispute for taking steps to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> to a newly created subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 225 million. The service operates between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> barred Eastern from taking any further steps to sell the shuttle, ruling the transaction would violate the status quo in working conditions he had ordered last summer. The proposed sale was opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which charged the company was trying to undermine the union's ability to represent shuttle employees by transferring the operation to another subsidiary. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> refused to comment Tuesday on why the airlines filed the motion, saying only: `` The entire letter is under seal and we do not care to clarify.'' Court documents requesting that the clarification motion be placed under seal said Eastern was trying to protect `` confidential and proprietary information about its business plans.'' `` Eastern would be placed at a serious and irreparable competitive disadvantage if the information contained in the motion and memorandum and supporting affidavits is made public,'' the company's deputy general counsel, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said in a sworn affidavit. `` Disclosure of the information could impair <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to manage its operations and to resolve its financial difficulties.'' In a reply to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request, attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> said the union did not agree with the airline's interpretation of <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s order. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here is scheduled to hear arguments Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal of <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s order barring the shuttle sale.
