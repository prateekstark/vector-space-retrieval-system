<TEXT>
 The major opposition group nominated historian <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuer </PERSON> to run for president in multiparty elections, group leaders said Sunday. The Hungarian Democratic Forum made the nomination at a three-day congress that opened Friday as parliament ended a landmark session in which it adopted laws to open the way for the first multiparty parliamentary elections in more than 40 years. The elections are to be held next year but the presidential balloting is to be held by the end of the year; no date has been set. Subsequent presidents are to be appointed by the new parliament. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is backing <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a popular reformer, as its presidential candidate. The parliament created the presidency in constitutional amendments adopted at its last session. After his nomination Sunday, Fuer acknowledged that <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> had built up `` a media advantage,'' but he said he believed he still had a `` good chance of winning.'' The Democratic Forum claims 20,000 members. In his acceptance speech to the 850 delegates, <PERSON> Fuer </PERSON> said: `` We can risk anything for democracy and for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but we can not risk Hungarian democracy for anything.'' <PERSON> Fuer </PERSON> said he was dedicated to `` European Christian values.'' He also praised Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying that without `` his courage and -LRB- reform -RRB- initiatives, what is happening now here could not have taken place.'' The Democratic Forum is one of several prominent opposition groups that signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to hold direct presidential elections before the end of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dissolved itself two weeks ago to create a the new <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That party professes democratic ideals but continues to hold power until the multiparty elections. Delegates to the Democratic Forum's congress also elected <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Antall </PERSON> as their new chairman. <PERSON> Antall </PERSON> told a news conference that former chairman <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> had objected to the group nominating its own presidential candidate. <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> was quoted by the independent daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> as saying he considered <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> a `` suitable'' presidential candidate.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union on strike against the airplane builder planned to talk about the labor dispute Monday, but not to each other. No new negotiation sessions were scheduled as the strike by 57,800 machinists nationwide enters its 20th day. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> was scheduled to speak Monday to a select group of media and business leaders on `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Strike: The Inside Story.'' The meeting before the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION> will be closed and none of the comments can be published. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Keiser </PERSON>, communications director of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said she objects that media leaders would agree to such a gathering. `` These are the people who set the tone for news coverage, and they're part of a secret group of the business leaders of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` What kind of corporate dogma are they learning in those meetings?'' The labor council and <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union scheduled their own briefing on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, planned to talk to labor leaders in an on-the-record session open to the media and scheduled for the same time as <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> vice president and group secretary, said the off-the-record sessions permit speakers to talk candidly without fear their remarks will turn up in headlines. The speakers' remarks often are the same as those they've already made in public forums, he said. The group, founded in 1933 by The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the chamber, includes members from the Times, <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> television stations <ORGANIZATION> KOMO </ORGANIZATION>, KING and <ORGANIZATION> KIRO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunsire </PERSON>, editorial page editor for the Post-Intelligencer and a member of the group, said he considers the meetings a valuable resource. He likened them to off-the-record briefings given occasionally to newspaper editoral boards. `` If it were up to me, however, these meetings would be on the record,'' <PERSON> Dunsire </PERSON> said. A Wednesday negotiating session called by federal mediator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> ended with no progress after several hours.

 Film legend <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON> says she never expected the story of a girl and her ape to have staying power. `` I thought ` King Kong' was an unusual story at the time, but I never thought it would have any endurance to speak of,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wray </PERSON>, 82, who is to appear here at a weekend film festival. Ms. <PERSON> Wray </PERSON>, a leading lady in 1930s films, said she feels her career includes `` a small body of enduring work, I suppose, to look back on with pride and affection, and somewhat more that I can ignore in good conscience.'' She retired once _ in 1942 _ but returned to acting in the 1950s following her husband's death. She played character parts in handful of forgettable movies, such as `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and the Bachelor'' and `` Dragstrip Riot.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s School of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> is teaching officers from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> how to fight the narcotics trade. `` The students are concerned about narcotics,'' said Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commandant of the school at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>. `` They recognize it as not only a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it's now become apparent to them through an increased number of drug addicts in their own countries.'' The school, relocated from the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 under the terms of the U.S.-Panama canal treaties, trains military personnel from 18 <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations, said <PERSON> DePalo </PERSON>. Six new courses are aimed at violent drug traffickers, <PERSON> DePalo </PERSON> said. Subjects include use of ranger units, strategic intelligence and disarming booby traps. The classes range in length from a month to a year. The school has no structured semester-type system, and individual officers set up their own schedules. DePalo, who is fluent in Spanish, visits a Latin American country each month to meet with military leaders, to promote the school and to make sure its courses are relevant. As far as winning the battle against drug trafficking, the key will be in getting the countries to limit and supress the supply, he said. `` They say we need to do more on our end in controlling consumption and they're right,'' <PERSON> DePalo </PERSON> said. `` This thing has to be attacked consistently and unrelentingly, but at least the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public has awakened to the fact, it appears, that this is a serious national security threat, more serious than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at this point.'' The School of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, founded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1947, has trained more than 50,000 officers and enlisted military personnel from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984 after this country and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were unable to reach an agreement that would have kept it operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 Five Soviet engineers came to study building design. Nine Mexicans flew in to check disaster preparedness. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wanted precise detail on how much the earth moved. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police looked at emergency response. For all its havoc, last week's earthquake is now an international case study for experts focusing on how and why the earth convulses, what structures survive its tremors, and how to save shaken lives. `` If there's any comfort for the people who lost loved ones, it may be that all professionals learn from each one of these disasters. It means we can do better the next time,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckle </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` In a sense, it is a laboratory. Teams from around the world will come to learn from this,'' he said. Buckle was appointed by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> to investigate the collapse of the elevated, two-tiered section of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where people and vehicles were smashed between slabs of concrete and steel. The freeway was built in 1957 before design load requirements were tightened because of lessons learned in the 1971 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> earthquake, Buckle said. Existing roads and bridges were supposed to be upgraded to conform to new codes. `` New bridges were not just designed for strength but ductility, the ability to be pliable without collapsing. They well knew they had not brought that highway up to code. Maybe this will accelerate that program,'' Buckle said. I-880 was scheduled for improvements, but the state had deferred the work was because officials thought the highway was structurally sound. In their labs, engineers tinker with theories on computers on how to make things strong enough to withstand jolts. Now they can correlate their computer models against what happened in heavily populated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, just as they learned lessons from quakes in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't simulate these forces in a lab. The forces are so large,'' Buckle said. `` We do n't get very many opportunities to test theories or new design roles.'' Not all lessons are technical. Police and fire departments from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, sent monitors to observe the search and rescue work at I-880, where a burly dockworker was plucked from the crumbled concrete four days after the Tuesday temblor. `` In this business, we all try to learn from each other's disasters, what were the pitfalls and what goes well,'' said <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Sgt <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>. On Friday, five Soviet engineers walked through <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, an upscale neighborhood where as many as 60 buildings crumbled or were damaged beyond repair The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> experts sought to learn lessons they can use in the rebuilding of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which was rocked earlier this year by an earthquake of similar magnitude. The death toll there was 25,000, blamed partly on shoddy construction of brick and mortar homes. `` Your city is much better than ours was because we had prepared only for a 6.0 <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotylar </PERSON> through an interpretor. Both quakes registered 6.9. A nine-member delegation from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> came to learn about getting ready for an earthquake because that country was underprepared for the 1985 earthquake that ravaged <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They did not have a national system of disaster preparedness or a civil emergency agency,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>. He said his office had also been contacted by several states hoping to learn from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s experience, and he expected delegations from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> when things settle down. `` This was a tragedy, but it would be even more of a tragedy if we did n't learn what we could,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. The greatest number of earthquake sleuths concentrated on the epicenter on <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in the Forest of <LOCATION> Nisene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 10 miles from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. Two plates of earth slipped 11 miles underground with enough fury to move mountains, flatten freeways, buckle bridges, crumple buildings and interrupt baseball's premier event, the World Series. Geologists and seismologists swarmed the mountain, searching for cracks on the surface that would show where the San Andreas Fault ruptured. Baffled scientists have been unable to locate the main fissure. `` We should see surface displacement of as much as 3 to 4 feet,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Streitz </PERSON>, a geologist with the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Division of Mines and Geology. `` It's a jigsaw puzzle with 10,000 pieces,'' said geologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. The quake triggered 90 instruments around the area that had been preset to measure the speed of movement in buildings, structures and the ground. A comprehensive analysis of those readings will take up to a year, although Japanese experts have already asked <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials for them via fax machines. Experts will also focus on schools and hospitals to see how they survived. Undamaged structures will be studied for design features that helped them get through.

<TEXT>
 Volunteer lines were long and stacks of information huge, but the victims were few Sunday at this city's only <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> disaster center And the visits did not change the lives of those who did show up. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> opened seven one-stop disaster relief centers Sunday, one each for the counties affected by last week's earthquake. Volunteers helped people fill out applications for low-interest loans, individual and family grants, temporary housing, counseling, tax information, legal service referrals, Social Security, veteran's benefits or hiring a contractor. The centers opened at 1 p.m. By 3:35 p.m., 126 people had registered at this center set up in a gymnasium at the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> army base, just blocks from the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, one of the areas hardest hit by the 6.9-magnitude quake that struck at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday. By the end of the day, 565 applications for assistance had been submitted to <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> at all seven disaster centers, said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cogan </PERSON>. In addition, 6,241 applications had been accepted over a special telephone hotline. Federal officials expressed disappointment at the Presidio turnout. `` Typically we have the longest lines on the first day,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Only 35 or 40 people were in line when the center opened, he said. At the entrance to the gym, temporary <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> employees waited to help, but they outnumbered victims all afternoon. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosendin </PERSON>, both <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers, were concerned about the low turnout. `` It's been a lot slower than we thought,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. `` Most of the people want money right now and we ca n't give them money.'' But doctors, psychologists and counselors were available, she said. `` I just heard about some aid. I have nothing but these clothes,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, who lived in one of the Marina apartment houses leveled by an earthquake-triggered fire. `` The apartment building was totally demolished. It burned down. It's not even a pile of rubble. It's a hole,'' said <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, a title insurance writer. He's been sleeping and eating at a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter, although he moved in with a co-worker Sunday. He's spent his days distributing supplies for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` Just seeing everybody else being so confused and upset, it's contagious and scary,'' he said. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> did not leave the relief center with a new place to live or any more clothes, but he took several forms he would fill out for help later. Those included an application for temporary housing that could shelter him for up to a month. But <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> will take at least 72 hours to process that application. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were on their honeymoon in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> when the earthquake struck. They came home to find themselves homeless. `` We've got all our belongings sitting in an apartment we have no access to,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. They were allowed into their rented apartment in the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district to gather clothing, but the building is structurally damaged and considered unsafe. The Millers said inspectors had n't decided yet if the building could be repaired. But even if it can, the Millers say they are unsure if they will return permanently. `` We always knew the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> had problems because it is built on a landfill. We saw fourth-floor apartments at the ground floor level and the thought of people being trapped is pretty upsetting,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The owner of a four-unit <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> apartment building came to the center to find out what could be done about cracked sidewalks, an open water main, structural cracks, plaster debris and other damage. `` The building has n't been inspected yet, but the building next to it had to be bulldozed,'' the landlord said. He declined to give his name. Helping others has eased the shock and sense of loss for some people, <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said. But there are so many little things that people do n't think about. He spent several hours at a bank Saturday proving who he was, without identification papers, so he could access the modest balance in his savings account. He waited in line at a post office to file a change of address form so his mail would go to a co-worker's home rather than a charred, vacant lot. `` I've walked 100 miles in the last couple of days. I see no faces I recognize. Getting word about my neighbors has been almost impossible. It's nuts. It's like nobody ever lived there. I feel like I'm in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Happy Townspeople: Big Buck Helm Was ``Too Arrogant to Die''</HEAD>

 Friends of big Buck Helm, latest legend in this misty mountain town, are n't surprised he survived his entombment under a collapsed freeway. They say he's too tough and too proud to die. `` Buck's a happy-go-lucky, generous guy, but let me tell you, I would n't want him mad at me,'' said local inn owner <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` He's just too arrogant to die,'' her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, said with a grin. `` Now we've got something to brag about besides the fact that we live in the only county in the state without a single traffic light,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` He's the legend of <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>. ... This town will throw a big party when Buck gets back, you can bet on it.'' As Helm, 57, lay in a big city hospital bed after almost four days in his car under <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s collapsed I-880, his feat was the main topic in the neon-lit cafes and service stations crowding this town's historic Gold Rush buildings. `` Out of all those people under there, he was the one to get out alive. We're all just so happy,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heald </PERSON>, another friend, as she sat in Helm's favorite hangout, the Nugget Restaurant. `` I just knew inside he was all right.'' Helm's survival was a shock to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, an engineer with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> who was inspecting the collapsed freeway when he saw a man wave at him through the window of a crushed car. `` It stopped my heart,'' said <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>. `` I thought maybe the wind was blowing and that's what caused it. I thought I might be losing it.'' About five hours later <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> was carried out of the rubble as exhausted workers cheered. In <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>, people are aware that <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>'s condition remains critical from the ordeal. `` We're praying for Buck in all our Masses,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, pastor at the Roman Catholic church here. `` Everybody is so glad he's alive.'' `` Buck is n't a churchgoer,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, a friend. `` But there is a spirituality about him and that's one of the reasons he survived.'' Across the street from the <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, a small crowd gathered to await the arrival of a newspaper vendor so they could read front-page news about `` Old Buck.'' `` Buck likes to tell a good story,'' said a laughing <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON>, who waited with the others. `` He'll get to tell this at least 3,500 times.'' <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> was referring to the population of <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>, about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The town depends on timber, sportsmen and tourists for its livelihood. Helm has lived here off and on since boyhood. He finally moved his wife and children back for good several years ago. He and his wife, <PERSON> Lorene </PERSON>, have since divorced, but friends say they remain close. Family members rushed to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> to be with <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, who spends the work week on the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> docks, sleeping in a van, and weekends at home.

<HEAD>More Low-Rent Hotels Condemned, Forcing Poor Into Streets and Shelters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new wave of homeless hit the streets on the weekend as safety inspectors condemned low-rent hotels damaged by <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s devastating earthquake. Evacuees sought refuge in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters, friends' homes and, when they could afford it, other hotels that may yet be condemned. The number of hotel residents displaced could hit 900 by the time all the city's buildings are inspected, officials said. The evacuations angered many residents, both because they had been allowed to remain in unsafe buildings for so long and because they were given only a few minutes to leave. `` Saturday evening, I came back here and saw all the commotion. People were out on the sidewalk, pretty emotional,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haines </PERSON>, 52, said Sunday. He was standing outside the condemned Hotel Menlo, wondering when he could return to his room in the eight-story brick building to pick up the rest of his belongings. <PERSON> Haines </PERSON>, whose old apartment was damaged by the quake, moved into the Menlo on Thursday, paying a nonrefundable $ 137 for the week. The building looked fairly sound: the exterior was missing a few bricks and showed a few cracks, and the interior did not appear seriously damaged, <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> said. But engineers decided Saturday that the building had sustained structural damage. The building was condemned and residents were told to leave. `` I got one box of clothes and my shaving gear,'' <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> said. `` That's all I could take. I tried to grab my TV, but they said to leave it.'' He moved to another hotel, but was afraid that it, too, might be condemned, and his cash is running out. <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> hoped to borrow money from co-workers when he returned to his job Monday so he could buy lunch. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> emergency planner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Warland </PERSON> said some evacuations were poorly executed, but that officials have changed procedures and now provide bus transportation and more time for residents to gather belongings. `` It's a very volatile situation,'' <PERSON> Warland </PERSON> said. `` They're frustrated and they're frightened They do n't have many possessions, and they're very protective of the possessions they do have.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, already operating three shelters in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, opened another one Sunday to handle the swelling numbers of evacuees. About 400 people used the shelters Saturday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was working with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to get people into more permanent housing. But that process was frustratingly slow for people who had been cramped inside shelters for days. `` When's this going to end?'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendonca </PERSON>, 49, said Saturday as he stood outside <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> elementary school, where 160 cots were lined up in the auditorium. Despite the wind-whipped rain, <PERSON> Mendonca </PERSON> said he had to escape the crowded, stuffy shelter for a while. `` I do n't want to be here,'' he said. `` I've got a job. All I do n't have is a pad.'' During the quake, <PERSON> Mendonca </PERSON> ran from his apartment under a shower of falling bricks. Saturday, he was allowed to salvage belongings from his condemned home, only to find that looters had beaten him to it. `` They took my television and ate my food,'' he said. Some shelter occupants said they had been promised more permanent housing by Monday; others said they were told it could be much longer. Many people are staying in their damaged homes, often without electricity or gas, showing up at <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> feeding stations for meals. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said stations in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> were serving about 3,000 meals a day. Some 4,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> area were without gas, but <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped to restore full service by Monday. A preliminary assessment showed that the quake destroyed or heavily damaged 120 houses, 250 apartment units, and 163 businesses in the communities of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leandro </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, all on the east side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said.

 We were just sitting down, trying to watch the game. Funny thing is, I ca n't tell you what game I was starting to watch. The first instinct I've always had with earthquakes is to wait for it to pass. I did n't want to wait for this one. We got out of the house in a hot hurry. I talked to a few other <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets and they all thought they were ` in country' for a minute. It was like a shock akin to an attack. For the next 45 minutes, we checked to see who had gotten hurt. That store -LRB- <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>'s Place, a general store -RRB- is the whole community thing right there and that's where everybody met. People worked together well, nobody asked questions, they just did. I was running the generator; others were stocking the shelves. People were looking for other people, trying to keep an even keel. It was more like the way things were ` in country.' The worst of it is, the aftershocks are not getting smaller, they're getting larger. In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, you got to where you could sleep in a certain state. You got to where your body can sleep, but your mind's awake. I think that's what everyone is learning to do now.

I went to work the next day because I knew we would have some major work to do with the agency. Once I got to work I did n't even think of my own personal life. One of the good things, you get so busy you do n't really think about your own being. When I got home at about 11 that night. I was exhausted and went to bed and did n't even try to call. He called me about 3 in the morning and absolutly cried because he was so upset. I said I was really sorry, because I knew I was OK. I just was so busy trying to organize the workers here that I did n't even think that you would be worried about me. So he was horrified.''

 I was waiting for the World Series to come on. I was sitting on the bed, just kicked back. I was so relaxed and all of a sudden I heard this -LRB- sound -RRB- _ it was like a bang. And I thought, ` Oh, another little earthquake. Cool.' ... But then, it felt like a giant took -LRB- the building -RRB- and shook it. First I looked up and I saw the ceiling, I mean the whole ceiling came down. I mean all of it, at once. I said, `` Oh, no.'' Then ... it shook so hard that the floor cracked. It more than just cracked _ it's like it broke, snapped in half. That's when I really got scared. I've been through earthquakes before, but not like this one. ... I was running for the door, because it kept shaking and they say get under a -LRB- doorway -RRB-. I did that, but that did n't work. Everything just rumbled, so I ran out of the building _ fast. Everything was falling ... the walls were cracking, everywhere. One weird thing, though. Hardly any glass broke _ mostly the wood and plaster, which maybe in one way was lucky. -LRB- I thought -RRB- `` Is this my last day on this Earth?'' They say there's going to be one bigger than this one? Lord help us all, really.

 I'll never forget where I bought my watchband. I was in <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s at Market and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> when the quake hit. I just slammed my money down on the counter and ran. I said to myself, ` I do n't want to die in <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s.' When the building started shaking, at first I thought it might be from the Muni trains underneath. For a second, I thought the shaking was over, then there was a ` boom' and it was like a giant had picked the building up and slammed it to the ground. I almost knocked over a little old lady on the way to the street. There was broken glass out there and a lot of dust flying. Then I went to my buildings to see if anyone was trapped in elevators. ... I worked until 2 o'clock and they called me at 5:30 or 6 in the morning to come back in to work. We all got about three or four hours' sleep those first two nights.

 I had just walked outside -LRB- my girlfriend's home near the Forest of <LOCATION> Nisene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, about 3 miles from the epicenter -RRB-. There was no reason. We talked about it later. We had just walked outside. I immediately said I hope the center was underneath my feet, otherwise there are going to be a lot of people dead. I immediately began to shake. I do n't believe I've stopped yet. It seems to me that the ground shakes every once in a while, but no one else feels it. It seemed to me the ground went down 2 feet then immediately it came back up and kind of rolled around. It was like the ocean going through the ground. You could hear it coming, then you feel it, then you hear it go up there. The worst part of the whole thing was not the earthquake _ it was over suddenly and it was done. The aftershocks were a terror. It's like, now it's happening again, but it does n't happen.

 The family of earthquake survivor Buck Helm was beginning to lose hope before he was dramatically pulled from the wreckage of a crumpled highway, his ex-wife said Saturday. <PERSON> Lorene </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> broke down in tears and cut short a news conference at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> as she described how the family learned that Helm had survived. `` By -LRB- Saturday -RRB- our hopes were getting pretty dim, but we said if anybody can make it Buck can make it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> said she had been in contact with missing persons officials Saturday morning, providing them with medical information. `` A few minutes later, the children heard there was a possible survivor,'' she said. `` A few minutes after 12 ...'' and she broke down in tears.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Rejects Ending Ban Against Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon has rejected a draft report by a military research center that concludes the armed forces should reconsider their policy of barring homosexuals from the service, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. A senior official said in an internal <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> memo that the report was flawed, offensive and wasteful of government resources, the newspaper said. In a statement Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the report did not respond to the original research request and has asked the author of the study, Dr. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbin </PERSON>, to prepare another report dealing soley with security questions. The unclassified report by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> says the Pentagon should reconsider its policy of barring homosexuals, a conclusion <PERSON> Sarbin </PERSON> said would most likely be repeated in the new report. <PERSON> Sarbin </PERSON> is a research psychologist and part-time consultant at the center. The report and the Pentagon correspondence were made available by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who believe the military should stop discriminating against homosexuals and allow them to serve in the armed forces. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., criticized the Pentagon for rejecting the report `` The report was an excellent academic survey of available literature. The problem is that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to deal with it,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> told the Times. The internal correspondence that criticized the document said the report went far beyond its job of determining security risks posed by homosexuals in the military while it examined the general question of whether they were suited for the military. The report, which was completed 10 months ago, dealt only briefly with the issue of security. The Pentagon has said that people who engage in homosexual behavior undermine `` discipline, good order and morale.'' In 1982, that policy was expanded to include men and women who have a `` propensity'' to homosexual behavior. The report said the government would probably be forced by court rulings to reconsider its court rulings. The internal <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> correspondence was written by <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, deputy under secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> for Policy. He said the center responsible for the report had no authority to conduct research on whether homosexuals were suitable for military service. He also said the Pentagon found the report `` to be technically flawed, to contain subject matter -LRB- Judeo-Christian precepts -RRB- which has no place in a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> publication, -LRB- and -RRB- to reflect significant omissions with respect to relevant court decisions concerning personnel security.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' astronauts Sunday to come home three hours early on Monday to avoid high winds at the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> landing site. Flight controllers had been working on a plan to land one orbit early but decided after looking at the forecast to shorten the flight by two orbits because of high winds expected in the afternoon. Each orbit takes 90 minutes. The new landing time at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> is 9:33 a.m. PDT.

The astronauts were awakened Sunday with the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> song `` Center Field'' _ the second wakeup call of the night. Earlier, an alarm sounded, signaling a high temperature reading on an auxiliary power unit heater. A crew member solved the problem by adjusting a sticky thermostat and shifting the position of the shuttle so the section of the vehicle housing the unit was not in the sun. Later Sunday, the five crew members planned to hold a news conference in space, answering questions from reporters at the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

 With a chorus of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful,'' the Japanese paid a warm tribute to former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> at a gala benefit concert Sunday. The concert, organized to benefit the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Presidential Library, began and ended with the patriotic song and featured <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Como </PERSON>, <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> and Japanese stars <PERSON> Yuzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayama </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toshihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahara </PERSON>. `` You'll never know, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, how much we need you. Please come here with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to stay,'' went the final tribute, set to the tune of `` You Are My Sunshine.'' The concert was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsoring the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' visit at a cost of $ 7 million. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Fujisankei </LOCATION> have refused to confirm reports he is being paid $ 2 million for his appearances. The Reagans waved to the audience and performers and sang along with them in a final chorus of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful.'' Scenes of events during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency were shown on huge video screens near the stage, which was lit in pastel pink, lavender and blue. The scenes were subtitled with phrases praising <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for `` restoring public confidence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and helping to `` maintain peace throughout the world.'' The audience of more than 10,000 paid $ 35 to $ 70 to attend the event at <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, 18 miles south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` I thank you for your interest in the presidential library ... I want to thank all of you,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in brief comments after the concert. `` I'm at a loss for words.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> toured a mountainside art museum in <LOCATION> Hakone </LOCATION>, 63 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, owned by <LOCATION> Fujisankei </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped along the way to shake hands with delighted Japanese museum - goers but did not respond to reporters' questions about his reported fee Fujisankei, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest media group, owns the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoso </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest commercial radio network, among dozens of other companies Like its chairman, <PERSON> Nobutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikanai </PERSON>, many of the company's media outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism At the time of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death and the controversy it spawned over his role in World War II, the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> generally carried few critical views of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imperial system. The network's low-brow programming contrasts sharply with the company's impressive art collections, including its outdoor sculpture garden in <LOCATION> Hakone </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> begins the two-day official portion of his visit, during which he will meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and other Japanese leaders. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will receive other tributes during his visit. The Japanese government plans to award him the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ one of its highest honors _ for promoting friendship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and working to protect the free trade system during his eight years in office. The only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to receive the honor was <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. The Reagans are scheduled to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Oct. 28.

 A senior military commander was quoted Sunday as saying that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has decided against buying French-made Mirage 2000 jet fighters because it has enough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes to meet its needs.

<TEXT>
 An official newspaper accused a well-known <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> writer and dissident of `` polluting the thinking of youth'' by taking part in the spring pro-democracy movement and said he will be punished. The blistering commentary, which was published Friday and seen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Sunday, was the first public attack on 71-year-old <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruowang </PERSON>, a prolific essayist who was put under house arrest in June. `` <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> is a writer in name, but his fame comes not from some outstanding writing but from some people calling him a ` democracy fighter,''' the Shanghai-based newspaper <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> said in a half-page commentary. `` He even attacked Comrade <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, calling him a ` power behind the throne,' and saying that ` the days when 1.1 billion people will submit to a monarch are over.''' An unknown number of students, professors, writers and other intellectuals have been jailed since the army crushed the democracy movement in June. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> papers since have reported <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was taken into custody, but efforts to telephone his home for confirmation were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> did not say where <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was but said: `` In the end he will be punished according to the law,'' indicating he faces trial. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has been jailed both by the Nationalists, for supporting the Communist revolution, and by the Communists, for criticizing their failures. For years, the official media and publishers have refused to print his works, but he found an outlet in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> publications. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was one of three intellectuals expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 after an earlier series of student protests. One of the others was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>. When government controls eased in 1988, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and other intellectuals founded a journal, `` The New Enlightment,'' that published daring, probing essays on subjects such as alienation in a socialist society. He marched along with students in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> during the spring democracy movement. <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> quoted him as saying during the protests: `` The day I have longed for has arrived. ... One thing is certain, once this student movement has begun, it can not be repressed.'' `` For so many years <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has used his tongue and poor pen to oppose socialism and incite counterrevolution,'' <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> said. `` His falsehoods and heresies won the acclaim of some people and the cheap applause of some immature youth. Now his set of tricks has been exposed.''

 <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Degui </PERSON> had just moved into a new house with three rooms when the earth came alive beneath his small village. `` I only lived in it for 12 days,'' he matter-of-factedly told a Western reporter touring the region. `` But when the quake hit, it just collapsed.'' Wan, like other peasants in <LOCATION> Guiren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, made few demands of the government after the worst quakes the region has seen in more than a decade. `` If we can resolve it ourselves, we will. If not, we will rely on what the government can do,'' Wan said, but added, `` what the government can not do we will have to do ourselves.'' The first of six strong tremors hit Wednesday night, and the others followed Thursday, leaving 29 people dead and 50,000 homeless. In a sympathy telegram sent Sunday to the quake-struck area in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> provinces, about 135 miles west of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the government called on residents to show a `` spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance.'' Wan's neighbor, <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, was doing his best. As the sun set Saturday, he was still sawing boards for the frame of a makeshift shelter he hoped would get him and his family of three through the winter. His house collapsed, as did 95 percent of the homes in his farm village of about 2,400 people set on a dusty, barren plain. Five people were crushed to death, and two were injured, Wan said. The homes were mainly one-story structures of packed clay with some stones and bricks to help hold them together. Three days after the quakes, villagers set up housekeeping in tents of straw and quilts. Their pigs and horses roamed the dirt paths. `` I was inside the house watching television, when I heard a loud sound, like thunder. When the ground started to shake, we rushed outside,'' said <PERSON> Guan </PERSON>. `` After the third quake, most of the houses had collapsed,'' he said. His cat was crushed to death. His wife, young son, dog and another cat escaped. His house in ruins around him, <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> still offered guests a traditional warm welcome, pulling out a red vinyl-padded folding chair and a glass of hot water boiled over an outdoor stove. His family has been sleeping since the quake in a straw tent, but soldiers who arrived in the village Friday were helping him build a stronger, although still temporary shelter. `` Yesterday there were five soldiers, today there were eight,'' he said. Altogether, several hundred soldiers came to the village, residents reported, bringing clothing, instant noodles, crackers and bowls. No one complained about the slowness of reconstruction efforts or the government's failure to immediately provide shelter for the homeless, who have huddled around fires and under makeshift tents during the near-freezing nights. `` Every family is living like this,'' <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> said. `` We have no other choice.'' `` My lips have blisters from the cold and my entire body is uncomfortable,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongxiang </PERSON>, a matronly woman who was bundled in several sweaters and a quilted jacket. `` My only hope now is to have a home, whether it's good or bad.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s two-day special session on abortion produced no laws but will probably end up the most expensive such exercise in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history. A survey of agencies involved in the session determined that spending totaled more than $ 473,000, with some reporting outstanding bills that are likely to push the cost to more than $ 500,000. Most special sessions cost about $ 40,000 per day, but past sessions did not involve as much planning and security as the Oct. 10-11 one on abortion. More than 600 law enforcement officers stood guard while some 20,000 people demonstrated on both sides of the issue. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called the session to take advantage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July allowing more curbs on abortion.

<TEXT>
 It was enough to make a little girl cry. The hand-carved carousel at Quassy Amusement Park, a favorite of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> children since 1919, was auctioned off piece by piece to high-rolling antiques dealers and collectors for a total of $ 638,000. By Saturday afternoon, the four dozen wooden horses, zebras, giraffes and other animals that had ridden together for decades were being separated and taken to faraway places like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` It chokes you up a lot more than you thought it would,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantzis </PERSON>, whose family has owned the amusement park for three decades. The merry-go-round was built in 1902. Quassy bought it in 1919 and operated it until this summer. Experts say only about 70 hand-carved wooden carousels remain of the estimated 6,000 that dotted the American landscape at the turn of the century. The Quassy carousel fell victim to a trend _ a bidding frenzy among private art collectors that has caused the value of antique carousels to skyrocket. The <PERSON> Frantzis </PERSON> family said it could no longer afford to maintain or insure the carousel and decided to replace it with one made of fiberglass. Bidding opened when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Filler </PERSON>, a scrap-iron dealer from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, bid $ 20,000 on the prize of the carousel, a lion. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> antiques dealer <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pemberton </PERSON> outbid Filler, offering $ 60,000. He said he would restore the lion and sell it. `` We've never had a lion and we wanted to get one,'' <PERSON> Pemberton </PERSON> said. One after another, the wooden animals were sold _ sea horses, camels, reindeers, a tiger and a goat. A camel went for $ 25,000, a tiger for $ 45,000, a giraffe for $ 27,500, and finally, the Wulitzer organ went for $ 21,500. Filler ended up buying six animals. The <PERSON> Frantzis </PERSON> family had hoped a collector would purchase the entire carousel and keep it intact, but no one came forward. Schoolchildren in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION> even wrote to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, asking him to buy the merry-go-round. But <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was not in the park when bidding on the individual pieces was complete and auctioneer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> offered one last chance to keep the colorful herd together. A bid of $ 766,000 _ 20 percent above the total of the separate bids _ would have saved the carousel. No one raised a hand. `` The machine has been sold piecemeal!'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> shouted.

 The government banned her, the anti-apartheid movement censured her and potential legal battles cloud her future. But <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has survived and is reclaiming her role as one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most prominent and defiant activists. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, vanished from public view in February when leading anti-apartheid groups repudiated her and accused her self-appointed bodyguards of waging `` a reign of terror.'' In recent weeks, however, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has emerged with high-profile appearances at several opposition rallies. The relentless speculation about her husband's release, expected within several months, keeps her at the center of the political stage. `` She is blunt, rash, emotional and speaks from the heart _ that is why people respond to her and why she is controversial,'' said <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Meer </PERSON>, author of a best-selling biography of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. `` Even during the crisis, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> had the support and loyalty of many, many people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Meer </PERSON> said in an interview. `` She will remain highly visible and widely respected.'' When six of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s closest <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colleagues were freed from prison Oct. 15, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> accommodated one of them, <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, at her home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the huge black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. She appeared that day at a rally for the freed prisoners. She prepared to sit alongside them at a news conference, but activists who organized the meeting politely directed her to a seat behind the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The releases are widely seen as a trial run for freeing <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, the country's best known black leader and possibly the world's most famous prisoner His release is considered necessary before black leaders _ even relatively conservative ones _ will negotiate with the white-led government. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> lives in a suburban-style ranch house on a prison farm outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. In recent months he has met several times with his wife, as well as with anti-apartheid leaders who denounced her. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> reportedly told his wife not to talk to the press. She remained silent for several months but has begun to speak out again. `` I am of no significance to anybody as an individual,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> Tribute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. `` To attack me is to attack <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, to attack the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.'' There has been no formal public reconciliation between Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the anti-apartheid movement, but the overt criticism of her has stopped. One activist who requested anonymity said anti-apartheid groups are attempting to resolve their disputes with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> before her husband is released, `` but several problems remain.'' He refused to elaborate. Several anti-apartheid leaders, including some who earlier denounced Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for `` violating human rights in the name of the struggle against apartheid,'' refused recently to speak about her on the record. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has expressed concern about some of her statements, and spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, noted she has no formal position in the organization. But he added that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` remains an important part of the struggle.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s provocative statements and courageous defiance of government restrictions made her one of the most visible symbols of black resistance. Her followers often referred to her as `` Mother of the Nation.'' She married <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in 1958, when she was a 24-year-old social worker and he was a 40-year-old <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader. Four years later he was arrested, and he has been imprisoned ever since. She was under police restrictions almost continuously from 1963 to 1986, was arrested numerous times and held in solitary confinement for 17 months in 1969-70. The repeated police action only inspired defiance in Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, now 55 and the mother of two grown daughters. She often appeared at funerals of slain activists, dressed in flowing dresses of black, green and gold _ the colors of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> _ to give fiery speeches and clenched-fist salutes. But her questionable political judgment, sometimes imperious style and reluctance to consult with anti-apartheid groups led her into repeated conflict with both the white authorities and the black community. Long-simmering disputes boiled over early this year when Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club, were accused of abducting four youths and beating one of them, 14-year-old <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, to death. Nine people associated with the club are in custody for the boy's death. He allegedly was kidnapped by the soccer team in December and beaten at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>'s body was found in a field, and the other three youths have given affidavits implicating members of <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. The group seldom played soccer, but often stayed at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home and accompanied her at public appearances. They were involved in repeated confrontations with police, journalists and local street gangs. The accused, in custody since February, have pleaded innocent. No trial date has been set. Anti-apartheid groups said in February they were `` outraged at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s complicity in the abductions and assault of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>.'' She has denied any wrongdoing. Police Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, who headed the investigation, declined to comment when asked if she might be charged. The death of <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> was one of several controversies that have dogged Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> since she unilaterally lifted her police banning order in 1985. At a rally in 1986, she endorsed the `` necklace'' killings, whereby militant activists torched gasoline-soaked tires placed around necks of suspected government collaborators. The government then lifted the ban on quoting Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in the apparent belief she would do more harm to her reputation by speaking out than by being silenced. In 1987, she was sharply criticized for building a mansion on a hillside in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, surrounded by tiny, overcrowded matchbox houses. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> reportedly has told his wife not to move into the house. The <ORGANIZATION> Mandelas </ORGANIZATION>' small rented home was burned in a July 1988 arson attack by <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> youths feuding with the soccer club. Community leaders urged Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to disband the team, but she ignored their advice.

 State Trooper <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did n't hestitate to jump a fence to reach a drowning baby kangaroo, but the idea of mouth-to-snout resuscitation gave him a moment's pause. Nevertheless, the trooper said, he `` blew into the nose a couple of quick breaths and that brought it right around.'' The <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> man was watching the kangaroos at <LOCATION> Hogle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> with his family earlier this month when a female kangaroo hopped over to a pond for a drink and her 18-inch-tall baby _ called a joey _ followed. `` Something spooked the joey and it jumped and when it jumped, it landed in the water,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Two black swans began flapping their wings, driving the joey into deeper water. `` My wife started screaming at me, ` <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, it's drowning! It's drowning!' he said. So he jumped the fence and pulled the animal to safety. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he could feel the joey's rapid heartbeat slow and its eyes became glassy. The mouth was clamped shut, so he puffed into the nose. `` Some of it boils down to pride. I'm in this thing this far.

 <LOCATION> MANILA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ Police killed 14 fleeing convicts after a prisoner stabbed a guard and helped other inmates break out of a northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> prison, authorities said Sunday. Nine inmates remained at large after the Saturday breakout at the provincial jail in <LOCATION> Cabanatuan </LOCATION>, 55 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Two other inmates were recaptured, officials said. Capt. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matias </PERSON>, deputy police chief, said the incident began after an inmate stabbed a guard with a pair of scissors, stole his M-16 rifle and pistol and freed 24 other prisoners. The guard, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Orcenas </PERSON> survived the attack, <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> said. Police and soldiers caught up with the escapees at a nearby field, and <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> said police opened fire after the escapees began shooting weapons they had taken from the jail armory. <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> said the inmate who instigated the escape, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paras </PERSON>, was among the 14 killed. He had been awaiting trial on robbery and murder charges. Civilian and military authorities have long complained of lax security and overcrowded conditions at the country's provincial jails, many of which were constructed more than a half century ago. In August, inmates seized a group of Christians who were holding prayer services at the city jail in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION>, 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Twenty-one people _ six hostages and all 15 would-be escapees _ were killed.

<HEAD>Appearance of Anti-Tank Weapons Changes Cambodian Battlefields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NATE THAYER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sophisticated anti-tank weapons have helped <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas score unprecedented victories against the Vietnam-backed government, according to Western diplomats and senior resistance officials. `` This is the most important weapon we have ever received,'' said <PERSON> Gen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON>, deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can now defend ourselves against tanks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and another guerrilla faction reportedly have received several hundred armor-piercing, anti-tank rockets in the past few months. The weapons were used in the recent offensive in northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, in which guerrillas seized several key towns and a number of government military positions, according to Western diplomats and guerrilla sources interviewed last week. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and a group loyal to Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> are loosely allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a war against <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam-supported government, which was installed after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power. The newly acquired weapons are the West German 67mm Armbrust, the 84mm Swedish <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON>, and the 89mm French LRAC, say the diplomats and resistance sources. Both the <PERSON> Armbrust </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> came to the two non-Communist factions through <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> weapons provided only to the <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> group came as part of a larger package of weapons from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> earlier this year, according to the sources. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has denied shipping weapons to the resistance. `` We receive many weapons ... we do n't know where they come from or who pays for them. I do n't know and I do n't want to know,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s senior military analyst. Senior resistance sources, who requested anonymity, said they strongly pressured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and key <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> supporters to help them acquire the weapons. More recently the resistance argued the weapons would be vital to an offensive planned to begin immediately after last month's pullout of Vietnamese forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Supplied mostly by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the guerrillas have previously been limited to light weapons. Government forces are supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with tanks, heavy artillery and a small fleet of fighter planes and assault helicopters. Guerrillas claim to have destroyed more than 10 tanks, armored personnel carriers and heavy trucks in the first two weeks of October, more than twice the number they knocked out in the decade-long war. The anti-tank missiles were first deployed in the offensive that began only four days after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said it withdrew its last troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Sept. 26. The resistance was unable to hold significant territory until this month. `` This will do for us what the Stingers did for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Stinger anti-aircraft missiles sent to the guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afganistan </LOCATION> are widely believed to have turned the tide in favor of the resistance several years ago. Bangkok-based diplomats say requests for weaponry and supplies go through the Cambodian Working Group, composed of representatives from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The Bangkok-based group reviews battle plans before approving weapons requests. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays the cost of some anti-tank weapons training, reliable sources say. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denies providing lethal aid to the resistance but a legal aid program exists that could include non-lethal military assistance. On a recent tour by The Associated Press of territory captured by the resistance, several Soviet tanks and heavy transport trucks were seen destroyed near the key towns of Thmar Pouk, <PERSON> Banteay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmar </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kandoul </PERSON> in the northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>. `` It is absolutely essential that we continue to have anti-tank weapons,'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffar </PERSON> said. `` If we ran out of anti-tank weapons tommorow, the day after tommorow the <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> tanks would roll over our positions.''

<HEAD>Maine's Returnable Container Law Seen As Nation's Most Expansive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> residents face changes in the way they live, work and play as the state phases in the nation's most far-reaching returnable-container law. By next September, refundable deposits will be required on every non-dairy drink container up to a gallon in size _ from tiny jars of baby juice to liquor bottles. All non-returnable containers, including single-serving `` juice boxes,'' will be banned, as will the plastic `` yokes'' that hold six-packs together. Environmentalists are delighted with the law, saying it sets a standard for the nation that will reduce rubbish and litter, save energy used in producing containers and promote conservation. `` Basically, they took a good thing and made it better,'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lawmakers. `` I really think <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> will be leading the way on this.'' Others, like grocer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION>, are unhappy. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said his market has already run out of space for storing returned containers, and he may have to convert an office into a used-can bin. `` It's absolutely scary,'' said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s `` bottle law'' was approved by referendum in 1976. Voters resoundingly reaffirmed their support and stopped an industry-backed repeal campaign in 1979. The current law, similar to those in force in fewer than a dozen other states, bans non-returnable containers for beer and soda and requires consumers to pay a deposit for each can or bottle. The deposit is refunded when the consumer turns in the container. Under legislation enacted this year, that will be expanded in steps: _ As of Jan. 1, anyone who brings more than 48 `` no deposit'' cans or bottles into the state will face fines of $ 20 per container Also on that date, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> joins a handful of states that charge deposits for liquor bottles _ 15 cents each. _ On Sept. 1, all throwaway, non-dairy beverage containers will be banned _ On July 1, 1991, plastic six-pack `` yokes,'' which do not decompose readily and have been known to entangle and kill birds and other animals, will be banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> legislative analyst <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said the ban is the only one of its kind in the nation. Although the legislation was the product of extended negotiations among diverse interests, some industry officials have vowed to step up efforts to weaken the law before the changes take effect. They maintain that aggressive but voluntary recycling is preferable. <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarman </PERSON> said his company will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to exempt baby juice jars. He warned that the added costs of special labeling required by the law would be passed onto consumers. Targeted for special opposition by industry is the ban on `` aseptic'' containers, or juice boxes, which environmentalists say are not recyclable because they contain mixed layers of plastic, paper and aluminum. `` It's an entirely different thing to say ` we're going to mess with your business' than to say ` we're going to terminate your business,''' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, a lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> Tetra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company that calls its product `` environmentally friendly.'' <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said her company may have an ally in consumers, who find the containers handy to pack in lunch pails and backpacks. Polls show strong popular support, said state Sen. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kany </PERSON>, co-chairwoman of the legislative committee that refined the measure. `` My phone has been ringing off the hook'' with offers of help to keep the law alive, said <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treat </ORGANIZATION>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary's Political Stock Rises After Stock Market Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the aftermath of the Friday the 13th stock market dive, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s political stock has risen for successfully avoiding the pitfalls that ensnared the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration two years ago. Before the crisis, the low-key <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> tended to pale in comparisons with his predecessor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, now secretary of state. But in spearheading the government effort to prevent the Crash of'87 from repeating itself, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is winning praise for deft handling of the situation. `` It was clear that the government stood prepared to help prevent a repeat of that 508-point debacle,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The policymakers all said the right things and helped to contain any problems.'' When the market dropped 108 points on a Friday two years ago, it followed with a 508-point plunge the next Monday. This time, Friday's 190-point decline was largely offset by an 88-point rise the next Monday. That success notwithstanding, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> hinted in an interview Friday that he may soon recommend several steps aimed at promoting more coordination among regulators. He would not be specific about what changes were being considered. In a free enterprise system, government policymakers are not necessarily concerned with imposing rules that inhibit the normal ebb and flow of market forces. But they are concerned when other factors _ particularly those unique to the high-speed, computer driven trading of the modern era _ threaten to undermine or overwhelm the more natural forces. In addition to directing the fact-finding operation that insured a supply of accurate information upon which to base decisions during the market plunge earlier this month, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> worked to have government policymakers from the president on down speak with one voice to project an air of calm. This time, there was no verbal gaffe to worry markets, such as then-SEC Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>'s comment to reporters two years ago that trading might be halted, a remark widely believed to have led to further panic selling. Other key roles were played this year by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who also navigated the shoals of the'87 crash, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who took the lead in the crisis-management effort, and his top aides at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are coming in for much of the congratulations for avoiding a repeat of Black Monday. Reviewing events during the interview in his office, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> played down his own role, saying policymakers were better prepared this time around and armed with more sophisticated means of monitoring market developments. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was on hand Monday morning watching the flashing signals that tracked developments in the stock markets, stock futures, international currency and bond trading not only in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but in markets around the world. For <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, market monitoring was nothing new. He spent 35 years on Wall Street as an investment banker. He also headed the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the panel which issued the first and, many believe, the best review of the causes of the record 508-point market plunge on Oct. 19, 1987. In addition, the two <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professors who directed the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> commission investigation are now working as top aides to <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Known as the `` gold dust twins,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary for finance, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary for domestic finance, are considered experts on the operations of financial markets. When the market began tumbling late in the afternoon on Oct. 13, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> turned to these two aides to launch a fact-finding operation that continued throughout the weekend. In 1987, when the stock market fell 108 points on the Friday before Black Monday, the response was far different. At that time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was in a highly publicized feud with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over international economic coordination. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s pointed criticism of interest rate increases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which he continued through that weekend, unnerved investors and were considered extremely ill-timed given the volatility in the markets. This time, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and others in the administration went out of their way to emphasize that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were in close consultation and coordination with major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did its part by letting it be known that it stood ready to inject large doses of cash into the banking system as a way of assuring jittery markets that cash-short brokerage houses would not have to sell off more stock because they could not get bank loans. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> performed the same function in 1987 but only after the huge Monday sell-off had occurred. By getting word of its intentions out over the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> helped remove a major area of uncertainty. Behind the scenes, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s fact-finding operation was turning up some encouraging signs that 1989 would not be a repeat of 1987. For one thing, there were technical signs in the trading data suggesting that computer trading programs that had been harmful in 1987 would not be a factor this time. In another turnaround from 1987, checks with 24-hour mutual fund hotlines indicated no rush on the part of investors to sell their holdings. Armed with this information, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> convened a meeting in his office late Sunday with <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> and various aides to review plans for the Monday morning market opening. In an effort to avoid any sense of panic, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> kept a scheduled speech Monday morning before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> while <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> attended the regular 7 a.m. White House staff meeting to counsel calm. His message: `` You should n't look at this loss on Friday as some cataclysmic event but more -LRB- as -RRB- an instantaneous technical reaction'' to a market that was somewhat overvalued. `` I do n't think anybody had an air of panic,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says in assessing the mood as the markets opened Monday.

<TEXT>
 From a distance, it is a stark, desolate array of odd, gray columns. Up close, it is an eerie display of automobile history. Art or junk, this creation of old vehicles called Carhenge attracts hundreds of people to the Sandhills of northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where residents are debating whether the monument _ or automobile graveyard _ should be preserved. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinders </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oil consultant, created Carhenge in 1987 as a takeoff on the ancient religious and astronomical site Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Instead of colossal stones, he used cars. He arranged 22 aging Plymouths, Fords, Chevrolets _ even an ambulance _ in a wheat field two miles north of Alliance. Sixteen cars are planted trunk down with their front ends in the air. Six more sit atop them, forming arches. In Alliance, a community of 9,900, city officials are debating whether to enforce a permit that requires <PERSON> Reinders </PERSON> to pave the entry to Carhenge by July 15, 1990, or see it torn down. A group called Friends of Carhenge, headed by City Councilman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Phaneuf </PERSON>, incorporated last week and wants to raise the $ 2,000 for the paving. <PERSON> Reinders </PERSON> says he already pays for liability on his property and is not interested in paying for paving. `` This is really good for <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and it did n't cost anybody anything,'' said <PERSON> Phaneuf </PERSON>. `` Finally, someone has given us something of value.'' `` It's wonderful for us,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marnett </PERSON>, manager of a local fast-food restaurant. `` It has created so much interest ... and it does put a grin on your face.''

<HEAD>Moslem Clothing Covers France With Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The decision by three North African girls to wear Moslem head coverings to junior high school has exploded into an intense national debate over religion in public schools. At issue is the secularity of education enshrined in French law since the official separation of the church and the state in this largely Roman Catholic country in 1905. Some argue that wearing the `` hijab,'' a scarf that covers the hair, ears and neck, is tantamount to proselytism. About 400 people shouting `` God is great!'' in Arabic demonstrated in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Sunday to support the teen-agers. Women wearing Moslem scarves carried banners that said: `` The hijab is our honor.'' The demonstration was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, which organized demonstrations a few months ago against the <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' The two groups, however, represent only a minority of Moslems in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The controversy over the scarves began in October at <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Achahoun </PERSON>, 15, her sister <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON>, 14, and their friend <PERSON> Samira </PERSON>, 14, all of Tunisian origin, were told by the principal they could not wear the hijab to school. The girls demurred. The debate grew. Negotiations started. Similar cases sprang up in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Montpellier </ORGANIZATION>. A compromise was reached at <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION> _ the girls were allowed to wear hijabs to school, but not in class. Again they demurred. Religious leaders _ Moslem, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> _ seemed to see little harm in the wearing of the hijab. But school and union leaders came down soundly on the side of keeping all signs of religion out of schools, saying secularity is one of the pillars of French democracy. Political leaders waffled. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldmann </PERSON>, the grand rabbi of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, reasoned that it would not harm other children to be aware of the differences between people. `` They learn to know and respect others,'' he said. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> of the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said wearing the hijab was `` the beginning of the Lebanonization of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> because it is obvious that if we continue to allow hundreds of thousands of Moslems to enter <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, we can not indefinitely deprive them of their customs, their rites, and when they become the majority, they will not hesitate to apply the charia -LRB- Islamic law -RRB-.'' Islam is the second-largest religion in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, with 2.5 million adherents. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenieres </PERSON>, principal of the <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Havez </PERSON> junior high school in <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION>, says he is only doing his job applying French regulations regarding religion in schools. The scarf clearly is `` a proselytic declaration'' by the three girls, he said. `` Imagine if it was not just three young girls, but 1,000 or 50,000.'' In <LOCATION> Montpellier </LOCATION>, 14-year-old <PERSON> Loubma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryad </PERSON>, who had been wearing her scarf to school more than two years, suddenly was asked to stop. Her parents withdrew her from school. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> criticized the French for invoking an old law against Moslems `` while wearing of crosses by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> students, and the special hats by Jews or their absence from classrooms on Saturdays, has not caused any problems for the secular schools in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, wife of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, said: `` If 200 years after the Revolution, secularity is not able to welcome all religions, all the -LRB- religious -RRB- expressions in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, it would be a step backward. If the veil is the expression of religion, we must accept traditions, whatever they may be.'' But <PERSON> Khorsi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadok </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Algerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Origin </ORGANIZATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had missed the point and was `` adding her support to a fundamentalist operation aimed at stopping the emancipation of Moslem women.'' <PERSON> Yannick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simbron </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest teachers' union, said the right to education must take precedence over religious customs. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedjini </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddam </PERSON>, who as rector of the Grand Mosque of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is considered the top Moslem authority in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said he was `` indignant'' at the attitude of school officials. `` If a young girl asks that her hair be covered, I think that it is her most elementary right,'' he said, adding that not only was the hijab not a religious statement, it was perhaps a reaction to certain modern clothes that were indecent. Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, warned against confusing `` the problems of Islam with those of adolescence,'' comparing it to the wearing of dreadlocks, long thin braids worn originally by Rastafarians.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The master paintings and sculptures of the Phillips Collection, the oldest museum of modern art in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, are luxuriating in bright new gallery spaces after a $ 7.8 million expansion financed largely by a wealthy Japanese businessman. The new Goh Annex, which opened in late September after two years of construction, more than doubles the private museum's exhibition _ to more than 30,000 square feet _ and ushers the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> into the next century with state-of-the art features comparable to the finest public museums New storage and picture-handling facilities, climate control equipment, a conservation laboratory and education classrooms made possible by the latest expansion, the sixth since <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> steel and banking heir <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> founded the museum in 1921 in his red-brick mansion near <LOCATION> Dupont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> opened three rooms of his home as a public gallery, his collection consisted of 237 paintings. Today, the museum houses about 2,500 works of art, many of them acquired and donated by <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and his artist wife, <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON>. The cornerstone of the museum's collection is <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s `` The Luncheon of the <ORGANIZATION> Boating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Impressionist masterpiece which <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> bought in 1923 for $ 125,000. Other notable holdings include <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>'s `` The Repentant <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>'s `` Self Portrait,'' <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' `` Dancers at the Bar'' and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s `` Still Life With Ham.'' The old masters form the backdrop for the works of modern artists that <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> sought to support and encourage, from <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnard </PERSON> to such American modernists as <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Keeffe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dove </PERSON>. The art collection grew so rapidly that it literally forced the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> out of their neo-Georgian mansion in 1930, and they moved to another home. In 1960, a three-story annex with sculpture garden was built next door. The new Goh Annex expanded the 1960 building outward and added a fourth floor. The latest addition was named for <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>, a Japanese art patron and pioneer of ocean transportation of liquid gases who donated $ 1.5 million to the Phillips last year. <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> first toured the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1951. He wrote later that `` the museum has stayed fixed in my mind since that time as an expression of individual endeavor and initiative.'' He said his grant was a gesture of gratitude to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he and his three children were educated. Funds for the Goh Annex came mostly from individuals, corporations and foundations, the same private sources that provide the bulk of the museum's annual $ 3 million operating budget. The <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also raised $ 1 million for the expansion project by sending 85 of its master paintings on a 1987 tour of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Besides proceeds from a $ 3 million endowment established by <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> before his death in 1966, the museum also receives an occasional federal grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> to underwrite some of the four to six special exhibitions it mounts annually. <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, son of the founder and former publisher of Washingtonian magazine, succeeded his father as the museum's director Over the years, the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has become a beloved institution to a loyal and steadily growing audience of art lovers who enjoy the quiet, unhurried ambience of the mansion's stately halls, as if they are welcome guests free to linger over a favorite painting as long as they wish. By 1986, before construction began on the Goh Annex, the number of annual visitors had reached 156,000. A popular <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> tradition since the 1940s has been the Sunday afternoon series of free recitals by promising young professional musicians, held in a long hall that was added to the mansion in 1907. Among the musicians whose early careers included performances in the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> `` music room'' were opera singer <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> and pianists <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ax </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Rockets slammed Sunday into a government military base used to launch missiles at guerrilla positions, witnesses said. Stray rockets reportedly killed at least four people living nearby. An additional 15 rockets pelted the city, leaving five people hurt, the government said. Witnesses in the northwest corner of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said more than a dozen rockets landed in the <LOCATION> Kargha </LOCATION> military base Sunday morning. One man who lives across the street from the base said the rockets kicked up large clouds of dust inside the base. He said he herd sirens within the gates of the base. The government denied the base was hit. Throughout the morning, a series of Soviet-made missiles were shot from the base at what are believed to be rebel strongholds in the <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> outside of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Every 30 seconds, a large boom echoed outside the base as another missile blasted off. Near the base, witnesses said one woman was killed when a rocket crashed into into her mud house. A child was injured when a rocket plowed through a mud wall and sprayed shrapnel around a courtyard where he was playing, the witnesses said. A couple were killed as they were walking with their cow when a rocket crashed into into a nearby elementary school and exploded, according to the witnesses. Sunday is usually a school day in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but elementary school has been canceled in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because of the war and a fuel shortage. On Saturday, a rocket ripped through the roof of a dining hall at a textile factory, leaving five dead. Another 13 missiles struck the city, killing an additional seven people. In the past 30 days, 47 rockets have hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, leaving 66 dead and more than 100 wounded, government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> announced Sunday. Since June, when the rocket attacks gained frequency, close to 400 people have died and about 900 have been injured in the attacks. The government blames the U.S.-backed rebels, who have been fighting 11 years to set up an Islamic state in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas claim the Soviet-backed government rockets its own people so it can blame the guerrillas.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> thought he might be hallucinating when he saw a man wave at him through the window of a crushed car trapped in the rubble of a collapsed double-deck freeway. `` It stopped my heart,'' <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said Sunday. `` I thought maybe the wind was blowing and that's what caused it. I thought I might be losing it,'' He looked again, and this time he thought he saw the man's head move in an effort to turn around. <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> immediately called co-workers on a radio to report that he might have found someone alive. About five hours later on Saturday, 57-year-old Buck Helm was carried out of the rubble as exhausted workers cheered and renewed efforts to find more survivors of Tuesday's earthquake. Helm, listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, was the first person found alive in the collapse of the I-880 freeway since the first night. More than three-dozen bodies have been removed. <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, who is 29 and lives in <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, normally spends his time inspecting highway structures that are about to be worked on by contractors. But like other <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees, he has done a variety of jobs since the disaster. Saturday he was inspecting a portion of the Nimitz where workers planned to remove crushed cars later in the day. He was checking the structure for stability, but what he saw made him question his own stability. As he told a news conference Sunday, he was working in tomb-like silence by the light of a flashlight in narrow spaces, with a clear view of Helm's car 30 to 40 feet away. That's when he thought he saw a hand come up and wave through a side window, <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said. `` He waved at me. It surprised me,'' he said. Unsure of what he had seen, he looked again, and the second movement convinced him there finally was a survivor of the Nimitz disaster. `` I was a bit shaky when I started calling on the radio to let the other guys know we had a live person in here'' and shook for 20 minutes afterward, he said. <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> stayed on the scene as rescue workers dug Helm out. He said he has not tried to contact the injured man, because he does not want to interfere with his medical care.

 After fleeing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with Hurricane Hugo gusting at his heels, the last thing <PERSON> Darrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> expected was to be caught in the middle of one of the nation's worst earthquake disasters But as the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> businessman walked through <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday, the sidewalk began to rock under his feet `` It was really scary,'' he recalled Sunday. `` A lot of people were running outside. I looked up at the buildings around me wondering if they would come down, and I ran into the middle of the street.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who travels around the country selling wastewater treatment equipment, said the coincidence of confronting two of the biggest natural disasters in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history was `` a little spooky.'' His wife, <PERSON> Melva </PERSON>, agrees. `` Once in a lifetime, maybe,'' she said. `` But not twice, especially in a three-week period.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> is a group product manager for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> EIMCO </LOCATION>, an equipment manufacturer once known as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. He was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to pitch his company's products at the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Just a few weeks before, on Sept. 21, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> was conducting seminars for engineers and consultants on <LOCATION> Kiawah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, when authorities ordered the resort community evacuated. `` The next morning, the winds were starting to blow. We went ahead and got off the island,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> remembered. `` The airport closed, so we drove a rental car down to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and flew out of there. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit that night. `` I got back into <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in time to watch the news accounts of it hitting <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding he felt both relieved, and a bit guilty, about having made it out in time. `` You kind of feel like you're leaving these people behind,'' he said. There was no escape from witnessing disaster last Tuesday, however. After the shaking stopped, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> hurried back to his downtown hotel. With electricity out, he climbed the stairs, in gathering darkness, to his seventh-floor room. It was while he was in the shower that an aftershock hit. `` It kind of knocked me around a bit. The main thing I could think of was I wanted to hurry up and get out of there because if the hotel came down, I wanted to have some clothes on,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. The next morning, on a trip that took nearly five hours to cross the Golden Gate Bridge alone, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and associates drove a rented car to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> to catch flights home. Friends have joked with him that he should stay home from now on. But <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and his wife plan to go to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> for their 22nd wedding anniversary next March. `` People have warned me that if I do, a volcano will probably erupt while I'm there,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said.

 In a crowded <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> subway train, commuters shake their heads in disbelief as they flip through the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>, its pages brimming with workers' complaints and admissions of official bungling In an apartment not far from the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> family switches off a variety show on West German television to tune in to the state-controlled nightly newscast. `` We have n't watched it for years, but we make sure we do now,'' said <PERSON> Ulrike </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a 38-year-old schoolteacher. In less than a week after the ouster of reform-resistant party leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s news media have shed their drab and doctrinaire image and given voice to unprecedented debate over the troubled nation's problems. Although the media still toe the party's `` leading role'' line, the transformation has been as dramatic as it has been swift. Long scorned by East Germans who looked West for the news, the media have embarked on a campaign of relative openness about the causes of the nation's current unrest. The shift has left many East Germans both amazed and skeptical. `` For years, the media here were a joke,'' said <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, a 25-year-old student at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Humboldt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They had nothing to do with reality, and the newspapers were full of interviews with happy workers while the rest were packing up to go West.'' One of the most frequent demands made by pro-democracy activists has been for a freer, more lively press. Although there is still no legal alternative to the state-run press, government media have begun to respond to the widespread calls for broader, more realistic news coverage. A day after <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> took over as party leader last week, <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> devoted four pages to critical examination of the nation's problems, including the flight of more than 55,000 East Germans to the West. For the first time in their 40-year history, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s media have offered prompt coverage of the pro-democracy street protests and other opposition events On Saturday, two senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials engaged in an unusually candid debate with East Germans who had just marched through downtown <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in demand of reforms. Less than two hours later, footage of the heated exchange between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Erhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krack </PERSON> was shown on the nightly news show `` <PERSON> Aktuelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamera </PERSON>.'' East German television now routinely broadcasts live interviews with state officials, who were rarely seen a few weeks ago and whose policies were never questioned openly. In a live TV call-in show Thursday, the day after <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> assumed power, East Germans grilled Communist officials on the government's long history of command-style leadership and its tight restrictions on foreign travel Another television program, geared to teen-agers, broadcast an interview with a dissident <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> pastor and concluded: `` We filmed this two weeks ago, but until now we could n't show it.'' <PERSON> Junge </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON>, one of the most widely read newspapers in the country, on Saturday carried a forthright report on democratic developments in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a first for a publication that had often ignored the reforms sweeping other East European nations. Officials also have revoked a nearly year-old ban on the Soviet monthly magazine Sputnik, whose critical articles on late Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and German Communists before World War II had angered hard-line East German leaders. While the discussions of social and economic problems encumbering <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unprecedented in official media here, the more candid reports do not yet measure up to the level of openness of Soviet media since Kremlin leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced his policy of glasnost three years ago. Direct criticism of officials in power remains absent, and there have been no challenges to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power. Many East Germans say government-run media must become far more critical and objective to gain the confidence of the people. `` Right now it's a curiosity, because no one has ever seen this happening before,'' said <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a 45-year-old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> secretary. `` They still have a long way to go.''

<HEAD>`Frozen Zoo' Coming Out of the Closet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Zoo has kept dozens of antelopes, cows and tigers in an 8-by-8-foot storage closet for nearly nine years. But now, one of the world's largest collections of frozen animal embryos has outgrown its laboratory, and the zoo has begun work on a $ 3.4 million facility expected to open in 14 months. Groundbreaking was Saturday. Dr. <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON>, director of the zoo's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproduction </ORGANIZATION> and Endangered Wildlife, is counting on the 16,000-square-foot lab to help save animals from extinction. `` It's a safety net,'' she said. `` Instead of feeding a herd of rhinoceroses, you can keep them frozen.'' The `` frozen zoo'' preserves species' genetic material while conservationists try to save their habitat or find room for them in captivity. `` If we had been able to do this for the dinosaurs, we could bring them back today,'' she said. Despite the limitations of working in the converted mop closet, she said the frozen zoo has produced 14 world firsts since the project started in 1981. One was the birth in February of a rare Indian desert cat through test-tube fertilization of a house cat. Successes have spawned similar research programs in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> is leading the way,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foose </PERSON>, conservation director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` This type of research is crucial to the survival of a lot of species.'' Private grants and fund drives will pay for the new center, which will accommodate up to 50 scientists. Ms. <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON> said officials hope to encourage scientific as well as financial interest by offering tours to visitors.

<HEAD>U.S. Bitterness over Vietnam Defeat May Impede Diplomatic Recognition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's reluctance to grant diplomatic recognition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> stems from the bitter legacy of military defeat, say a handful of congressmen who argue that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements for improving ties. `` We're punishing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for inflicting a very embarrassing failure on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' 14 years ago, said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., who lost part of a leg in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said the administration `` is n't thinking through its Asian policy very well It is driven by the same lack of understanding that led us to the bumbling mistakes of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' That argument, however, is rejected by administration officials and what appears to be a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously there's a bitter legacy but it does n't dictate our policy,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. As a condition for establishing diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, for the first time since the fall of the U.S.-backed <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> government in 1975, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration demanded an end to the 11-year Vietnamese military occupation of neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The Vietnamese say the last of their troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> last month. But normalization of ties is stalled over the make-up of a new <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> government that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration seeks to replace <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, installed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and still in power. The dispute over the Cambodian government, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official, `` is not a new barrier we've erected to protect ourselves from the specter of normalization'' with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It is part of the package, he said. Critics of administration policy say recognizing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would raise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence throughout the region. `` We must, for our strategic and national interests, get back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' to reassert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and compete with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is still influenced by `` feelings of anger and desire for revenge ... motives that ill suit a just and powerful nation,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass. At an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last July, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> refused to support a proposal to include <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in an interim government that would be led by U.S.-backed opposition leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> 1975-78, while in power killed an estimated 1 million compatriots in an effort to restore the nation to a primitive agrarian society. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders, now fighting a guerrilla war in the jungles along the Thai-Cambodian border, claim to have changed their ways, and have strong Chinese backing to be included as one of four Cambodian factions in a coalition government. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese balked at including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and are backing <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of intransigence, saying inclusion of the militarily strong <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> _ loathsome as it may be _ is essential for achieving a negotiated settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Such a settlement would include a halt of foreign arms supplies to all parties, an international monitoring force and free elections. `` In that context, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would be containable,'' said the senior administration official. <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> and several other lawmakers argue that it is hypocritical to criticize <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for opposing the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and accuse the administration of backing a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> presence in an interim government for fear of antagonizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Among the administration supporters on the issue is Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and former prisoner of war, who last year sponsored a bill to establish low-level diplomatic ties. He withdrew it when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> suspended cooperation for several months on the search for missing Americans. `` No serious public official in this country will ever tell the families of the ... Americans still missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that we intend to proceed with the improvement of relations absent any realistic expectation of Vietnamese cooperation in determining the fate of their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers,'' he said in a recent <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> opinion piece. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in recent months has been providing more information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> MIA's, and has been allowing Vietnamese formerly associated with Americans or fathered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Yet Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said several months ago that `` the issue of missing American servicemen must first be resolved'' before official ties can be forged. The administration says progress has been made in accounting for the estimated 1,700 Americans missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Another in a series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official delegations of officials and forensic experts is heading for <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> later this month.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Advocates Concede Battle, But Not War Over Bush Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Abortion rights advocates conceded Sunday they have little chance of overriding President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a bill allowing Medicaid to pay for abortions for victims of rape or incest. But pro-choice lawmakers and lobbyists said they still will put up a fight to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto on the $ 157 billion Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. `` The outlook for an override is not good,'' said <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a main pro-choice lobbying group. While the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the spending bill, including relaxation of the Medicaid abortion restrictions, last Thursday by a 67-31 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote a week earlier was 216-206, far short of the two-thirds that would be needed to override the veto. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also threatening to veto two other pending pieces of legislation over abortion-related issues: a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> appropriations bill allowing Medicaid to pay for all abortions for poor women in the nation's capital, and a foreign operations bill that would lift restrictions on funding <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' family planning programs. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., a longtime leader of pro-choice forces in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged the prospects for an override in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> now are slim, but he suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> keep passing the same appropriations bill If Republicans lose next month's gubernatorial races to pro-choice Democrats in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> predicted, `` you may see a chance in the House'' to override a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> abortion veto the second or third time around. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' show, said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers are shifting under pressure from constituents toward a more pro-choice stance. `` The people in my party are talking about this issue and are frightened to death of it, and they suddenly see that the tide has turned,'' said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed the measure Saturday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> where he spent the weekend after returning from Friday's tour of earthquake damage in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was unwilling to permit federal funding of abortions `` other than those in which the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'' That is how the Medicaid law has stood since 1981, he noted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally believes rape and incest victims should have a legal right to obtain an abortion, but he is unwilling to pay for the procedure for poor women. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for keeping his campaign commitment on abortion. He said his group, the leading anti-abortion lobby, is urging its members to contact members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to uphold the veto. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., a pro-choice lawmaker, said, `` Clearly, we'll try to override Clearly, that's probably not going to happen, so he wins.'' She said that vetoing the Labor-HHS bill threatens funding for essential health and human services programs. `` His veto is stopping the government. ... This is massive. It's clear he's playing politics to the end,'' she said

<HEAD>Lacroix Springs Summerwear, But Luxe Are Deceiving</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> woke up the fashion crowd Sunday with his show of bright, peppy clothes in ready-to-wear and `` luxe'' versions for the 1990 summer season. Both lines showed some leggy looks, long pants and <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s curvy cuts `` Luxe'' was simply richer than ready-to-wear, and will cost a few thousand dollars more per outfit. In both shows, he included some of his oval skirts and fitted jackets, plus a few of his famous fichu collars and trapeze-line coats and dresses. Pants ranged from full and cropped to `` cigarette'' slim, under tunic tops and dressy jackets. The slightly simplified, sportier ready-to-wear lines led off with a blue drawstring parka over narrow madras plaid pants, and color burst out from there on _ often with <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s ebullient mixes of flowers, checks, plaids. It was a sunny, summery collection of high spirits by the young creator from the sunny south of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, showing sunhats and beachwear galore this time. While many designers were bringing out lots of rusty, even muddy autumn colors, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> went out for a fresh palette of pinks, reds, violet, pistachio and chartreuse, in clothes that often came out looking younger than springtime. His fitted suits of huge houndstooth checks came out in turquoise or chartreuse and black for a striking city look. But the daisy-printed floral Provencal cotton jackets paired with full short skirts in a different print were happy-go-lucky <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> at his best. He showed a lot of leg in the bloomer shorts or skirts and bright pistachio or pink linen jackets with big jeweled collars. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s simplest line involved delicate mixes of pastel twinsets and chocolate brown pleated skirts or straight pants. The pearl-buttoned knit toppers had puffed organza sleeves rimmed in gold. While some of the brightest patchworks with heart and star print motifs came out in trapeze-line dresses, much of the collection was based on sexy bustier tops, especially in multicolored lame brocade cocktail dresses. The `` luxe'' clothes were sometimes dolled up with so much lace and glitz that the chic was nearly hidden. But there were also some fabulous clothes in this near-couture line. Some of the sweetness nearly got out of hand in this show _ with the sequined, pink or blue taffeta-ruffled, lace-edged wraparound dresses _ as the loudspeaker warbled `` May Time,'' by <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. Even the `` tiger ladies'' in their chiffon animal prints looked more innocent than wild, though one was a clinging, ruffled and gathered number to outline an hourglass figure. The chiffons ranged from nice navy numbers with `` godet'' flounces at the knee-length hem for dancing, to some wonderful pink and raspberry flower prints draped with a big scarf fastened with an outsized rose at the shoulder. Black lace, navy pleated chiffon and sparkling embroidery on short dresses and pajama outfits topped by tunics ended up this show that offered the ultimate in dressy summer wear. Luxury in a totally different vein was laid on with heavier brush strokes by <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON> in his second <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> show. Currently the darling of the fashion world, <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON>, 39, prefers the madcap <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> fashion whirl to his native <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for showing his clothes. After last spring's hit show, this second offering was played to a packed, enthusiastic house. It was a case where the clothes wore the women. Models minced down the runway looking barely able to walk, constrained by silky, gossamer shoulder wraps, puffed tutu-skirt effects over lean silk trousers worn with colored tights and flat sandals. The outfits were treated as artwork. They ranged between Byzantine and Oriental opulence, with the most dazzling iridescent silks, lace, velvet, gold-threaded sheer fabrics often in the burnt colors of autumn. It was like looking at a series of paintings rather than clothes to wear to a party. Full, stiffened tent-like shortie coats over figured pants had the look of hieratic characters in a Byzantine mosaic, especially with the flowing pearled earrings bigger than chandeliers draped over the shoulders. But <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON> can cut, and his slim iridescent or metallic lame silk tail-coats looked wonderful over slim pants. <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitbon </PERSON> brought out dozens of sailor suits, a couple of Batman types in body stockings and capes and a few cowgirl styles. At the opposite end of the spectrum from <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sitbon </PERSON> showed peppy clothes that were mainly for the young. In tones of navy or rust linen, the seagoing set was decked out in vests and middy collars or battle jackets with striped shirts up top. Below decks it was short corsair or long bell-bottomed trousers _ and a perky shorts-jumpsuit for good measure.

<TEXT>
 A policeman goes on trial Monday in the deaths of two blacks as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> moves to head off a repeat of the race riots touched off by the case. Acquittals of police officers in the deaths of blacks sparked violence here in 1980 and 1984. The impeachment conviction Friday of a popular black federal judge, a heated local election campaign and the drug war could raise tensions. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 32, is charged with manslaughter in the Jan. 16 shooting of motorcyclist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and the death of passenger <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> in the ensuing crash. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> tried to run him over and he fired in self-defense. The deaths touched off three days of rioting that claimed two lives and caused $ 1 million damage as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was getting ready to be host of the Super Bowl. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, a native Colombian whose brother is also on the force, is viewed by many in the area's prominent <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> community as a political scapegoat being sacrificed to ease racial tensions. They have raised thousands for his defense. To blacks, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is proof that white police officers put lower value on a black life. Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> says fear of a riot prompted him to ask Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> to move the trial, a request <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> is expected to take up Monday. The city plans to have all 1,100 police officers on call at the end of the trial, expected to last three weeks. It also has ordered 700 gas masks and has two armored personnel carriers and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> military equipment available. A community relations board has been advising residents on how to avoid violence, and a rumor-control hotline was set up. Black plans to tell jurors that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was fleeing from another officer who had tried to pull him over and that the motorcyclist, whose neck and wrists were laden with gold and diamonds, was a drug dealer with good reason to flee. When killed, he had a suspended license, $ 1,500 cash and a bag of marijuana in his pocket, cocaine, alcohol and marijuana in his blood and an arrest record for marijuana possession, according to authorities. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> counters that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s troubles are irrelevant and that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot without justification The shooting came just hours after thousands of blacks paraded in memory of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 This mountain town of gas stations and Gold Rush ghosts is embracing a new local legend _ Buck Helm, the man who cheated death under a big-city freeway. `` Now when tourists ask what's so special around here, we can tell'em we have a citizen who survived four days under a freeway,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, who with his wife <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> runs the Old Yellow House Bed and Breakfast on Main Street. `` He's the legend of <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. On Sunday, a day after Helm, 57, was pulled from beneath <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s earthquake-collapsed double-deck I-880, the little town was socked in by rain and fog. Deerhunters rowded the <ORGANIZATION> Diggins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tavern </ORGANIZATION>, the mountain roads too muddy for hunting. Two small boys floated a makeshift craft down the rushing gutter on the main street amid the smell of wet leaves and roar of pickup trucks. Across the street from the <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, a small crowd gathered to await the arrival of a newspaper vendor so they could read front-page news about `` Old Buck.'' `` Buck likes to tell a good story,'' laughed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON>, who waited with the others. `` He'll get to tell this at least 3,500 times.'' <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> was referring to the population of <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>, a historic Gold Rush town 250 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> that is now dependent on timber, sportsmen and tourists. Church bells rang through the valley, and congregations prayed for Helm, many aware that his condition remains critical from the ordeal of four days pinned in his car beneath the freeway. `` We're praying for Buck in all our Masses,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, the pastor at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here. `` Everybody is so glad he's alive.'' `` We're asking the Lord to strengthen and heal him,'' said <PERSON> Deena </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, wife of the pastor at Faith Family Center. `` Buck is n't a churchgoer,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, a friend. `` But there is a spirituality about him and that's one of the reasons he survived.'' Many here are acquainted with Helm, but those who know him well seem few, even though he has lived here off and on since boyhood. He finally moved his wife and children back for good several years ago. He and his wife <PERSON> Lorene </PERSON> have since divorced, but friends say they remain close. Family members rushed to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> to be with <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, who spends the workweek on the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> docks, sleeping in a van, and weekends at home. `` Buck has always had a real sense of family,'' said <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, the proprietor of a hunting and fishing store. `` And he is generous too, with himself and his money,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. She and others recalled how <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> spent his state tax refund this year on an `` ice-cream cone incentive fund'' for kids who did well at his daughter <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON>'s fifth-grade class. <ORGANIZATION> Weaverville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON> has n't had time to think about how to honor <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>'s suddenly famous son `` But this town will throw a big party when Buck gets back, you can bet on it,'' said <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., predicted Sunday that $ 3.5 billion in federal earthquake aid would be approved this week, but said damage estimates from Tuesday's quake were already more than twice that amount `` Unfortunately, all the cost can not be covered'' by government aid, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> told reporters. `` There will be some loss.'' Property losses and damage to local roads are estimated at $ 6.12 billion by local governments, with damage to state and federal highways at an additional $ 1 billion, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. The senator said state government, with its $ 1 billion surplus, would have to provide money and the federal government would probably increase its contribution later. In addition, insurance will cover some losses; <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said 15 to 25 percent of damaged commercial property was insured, but he could n't say how many damaged homes carried earthquake coverage. The $ 7.12 billion damage total was at least $ 650 million higher than the estimate provided Sunday by <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said the damage figures were rising constantly and `` will probably go much higher before we're finished.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority whip, said about $ 3.5 billion in earthquake aid would be added Monday to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriation bill that must be passed by Wednesday to keep the government functioning. `` I have no doubt about our capacity to produce that money'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said, predicting no difficulty in getting the votes to waive the Gramm-Rudman federal spending limit or other legal restrictions on federal disaster aid. `` Every state has had an earthquake,'' he said. `` No senator, no House member can say, ` This is never going to affect me.''' Federal aid would include $ 1.44 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergecy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1 billion in highway funds, $ 1 billion for low-interest loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 50 million for veterans' hospitals in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. He said the first federal funds could be available within a week for these programs: _ Temporary housing grants from <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> for those made homeless by the earthquake _ Grants of up to $ 10,000 from <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> for family assistance _ For homeowners without earthquake insurance, <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> loans of up to $ 100,000 for real estate and up to $ 20,000 for furniture and other personal property The 30-year loans would be at 4 percent to 8 percent interest. _ For businesses, <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> loans of up to $ 500,000 to repair earthquake damage or raise working capital because of quake-related needs Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has also said the state will provide supplemental grants of up to $ 10,000 for the neediest families and individuals. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Saturday that until federal aid was approved, the displaced could seek emergency shelter with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> or pay for a hotel and seek reimbursement from the government. The agency was to open disaster-aid centers Sunday in each of the seven counties suffering earthquake damage.

 The blackboard in front of the student union lists Monday's main volunteer need _ help in transporting injured and displaced students around campus in golf carts. A sign nearby calls for cash donations to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Tables that usually have political fliers or information on campus events now are covered with emergency numbers and details of destruction. A few weeks after the start of the school year, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students are getting a lesson in coping with an earthquake. Twenty-six of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s 240 buildings, including the beautiful Memorial Church in the heart of the campus, were rendered unsafe after the Oct. 17 quak, and 34 more were restricted to limited access as repair estimates soared to $ 200 million. More than 1,600 of the 13,000 students were displaced the night of the quake, including 500 who remain homeless because of the closing of old fraternity and club houses. One of the biggest concerns, besides cracked walls and damaged equipment and furnishings, is asbestos exposure from the quake. The landmark Hoover Tower, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and repository for millions of artifacts, and the main building of the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> have been closed pending asbestos inspections. `` Considerable academic anxiety'' has struck the campus, university president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Most students are still unable to enter the library; many have been unable to retrieve books and notes from buildings that have been closed; many have been unable to obtain informations on classes, and still others have not been able to re-enter their residences.'' Student volunteers worked through the weekend picking up crumpled books, metal and plaster at the Law Library. Others moved the organ from the church, picked through debris in laboratories and swept up classrooms and dorms. The damage is not nearly as bad as in 1906, when the campus was virtually destroyed by the Great Earthquake. But last week's quake is taking its toll on students. The Memorial Church, with its mosaic tiles and stained glass windows, was partially destroyed in 1906, four years after its completion, and restored in 1913. The major damage this time was to the arch near the altar. The keystone _ the central block in an archway _ was more than a half-inch off center and may have to be rebuilt. `` In general, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> has done a good job of risk management,'' said <PERSON> Haresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one of the world's leading earthquake experts. `` The structural seismic work that we have been doing the past five years has really paid off. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> began a program in 1986 to assess earthquake risk in older buildings and add seismic bracing. Just weeks after completing recommended bracing projects in the Roble Hall dorm and the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION>, both buildings came through unscathed. So did the landmark <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, home to university president <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, although there was heavy damage to the contents. Scientific laboraties also were largely undamaged, as was the medical center and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> will have to foot the cost of the bill itself out of its endowment, loans and other funds. The university had earthquake insurance from 1980 to 1985, but then the insuring companies canceled the policy. The university decided to become self-insured, and as of Aug. 31 it had $ 3.4 million in an earthquake reserve and $ 3.6 million in a property reserve.

 <ORGANIZATION> Aptos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> murmured softly Sunday over the epicenter of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s deadly earthquake, its serenity belying the ruined towns, broken highways and bridges and shattered lives for miles around. While crews at the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> continued working amid twisted steel and crumbled concrete at a scene of almost unimaginable horror, a few uprooted trees and minor landslides were the only visible signs of the quake at its epicenter here in the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park. Jays and squirrels chattered from the canopy of branches high over head. A rockslide blocked the <LOCATION> Aptos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire road above the old <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> lumber mill. Farther up the mountain, a few mossy trees had toppled across the trail leading to the headwaters of <LOCATION> Aptos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, tentatively identified by geologists as the center of the 6.9-magnitude temblor. For geologists, the epicenter represents more symbol than significance, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhrhammer </PERSON>, a research seismologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` The epicenter is just a point on the surface immediately above the point where the rupture first started,'' <PERSON> Uhrhammer </PERSON> said. Geologists believe that point is about 11 miles below <LOCATION> Aptos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. For major quakes, however, the point of the rupture breaks into a fracture many miles long that releases tremendous amounts of energy as geological plates slip and slide violently past each other. The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park is a lush maze of ridges and canyons formed by the Earth's twists and contortions along the faults that run diagonally across it. The park was created in 1963 when two brothers of a locally prominent farming family, aided by the Nature Conservancy, donated 9,600 acres to the state in memory of their mother, <PERSON> Nisene </PERSON>, with the stipulation that it never be developed. Most of the park was clear-cut in a 40-year logging frenzy that ended in the 1920s, said park ranger <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>. Loggers cut 140 million board feet of lumber from the area. While isolated stands of towering redwoods thousands of years old remain in spots, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> supplied much of the timber used to rebuild <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after the great quake of 1906. At the turn of the century the Loma Preita Mill was the largest in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, employing 600 workers in the summers, <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> said. `` It was a company town,'' he said. The once-denuded forest was donated to the state in 1963, and red alder, big-leaf maples, tan bark oak and second-generation redwoods are making comebacks. `` This is a hidden forest here,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Aptos </LOCATION> resident who paused from his jog along the fire road. `` It's not marked on any highways and most of us locals treat it like our own preserve.'' Other runners passing in the forest exchanged quake-related pleasantries. `` Did your house make out OK?'' one voice asked, echoing among the trees. `` Oh, we lost a chimney and a plate-glass window,'' another voice replied. `` But we did pretty well.''

 Leaders of the 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday gave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> six months to deliver on reform promises or face new reprisals, and they called for tighter financial pressure immediately. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> alone dissented. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, rejecting key provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit declaration on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, charged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> embargoes have strengthened white extremism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But she went along with a stipulation that current trade embargoes remain for the time being. In its declaration, the organization of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies held off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> objected to provisions setting up a new body to scrutinize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s financial links and declaring that a foreign ministers' committee, which monitors sanctions and suggests new ones, will meet in six months. The 12-page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reform moves by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s new president, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who has said the black majority could have a role in politics in five years. It said there was a `` possibility that significant changes in approach on the part of the South African regime ... may yet prove to be within reach.'' The declaration was issued Sunday after final approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> leaders at a weekend retreat at <LOCATION> Langkawi </LOCATION> island, 210 miles northwest of here. In a separate statement Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, `` There seems to be a clear correlation between the imposition of additional sanctions by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> and the strength of extreme right-wing parties in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> utterly opposed to change.'' The statement took other countries by surprise. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> official, requesting anonymity, called it `` despicable.'' British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>, who was on the committee that drew up the final <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> declaration, said it showed `` a novel recognition'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> that change is beginning in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and that sanctions should not be punitive. Tanzanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Wmkapa </PERSON> called Major's interpretation was `` laughable. `` This declaration expresses our judgment that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has undertaken no fundamental changes,'' <PERSON> Wmpaka </PERSON> said in an interview. `` What's he crowing about?'' Canadian External Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, head of the committee, said `` nobody is buying'' that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has shifted away from apartheid, the system that denies the black majority the vote. The declaration noted that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> had `` accepted a degree of peaceful political activity by the black majority and on the eve of this meeting had released from prison eight political leaders.'' In parts of the declaration, the tone was milder than that of previous <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> pronouncements on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and it stressed the need for peaceful change. The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> call on international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to make it more difficult for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to get credits. It also said that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> arms embargo should be intensified. Current Commonwealth embargoes consist of 11 voluntary sanctions, including a ban on air links, drawn up in 1986. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refuses to impose most of the Commonwealth embargoes. Black African states, which depend economically on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, do not impose them. The sanctions fall well short of those imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 More than 500 East Germans gathered Sunday in a <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> concert hall to talk with local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials about reforms under consideration in the wake of last week's leadership change <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> said another pro-democracy protest was planned Monday night to keep up pressure on the government to implement reforms. Church sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said religious leaders in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> have compiled a report detailing alleged incidents of police brutality during demonstrations two weeks ago. The report lists 100 allegations of police beatings and other mistreatment of protesters, the sources said. It also quotes witnesses as saying many of those detained were strip-searched and beaten with clubs. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network quoted witnesses as saying one woman was struck in the stomach three times despite cries to police captors that she was pregnant. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting Sunday at <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s Gewandhaus concert house included `` citizens from all parts of society'' _ prominent local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials, artists, students, scientists and workers. No details of the discussions were provided by the news agency, other than that they covered `` topical problems'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The news agency said the orchestra's conductor, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Masur </PERSON>, was among the participants, and he suggested such meetings be held every Sunday to get the public involved in solving social problems. <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s Communist officials have pledged to start talking to the people following massive pro-democracy protests, the largest since a 1953 workers' uprising, that brought tens of thousands into the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> this month. In an even more unusual gesture toward dialogue, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Erhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krack </PERSON> engaged in a heated debate with pedestrians Saturday after an unauthorized march by activists through the streets of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. That discussion touched on travel restrictions and public skepticism about the sincerity of the newly touted reforms. It was broadcast less than two hours later on state-run television's nightly news program Much of the change has occurred since Wednesday, when 77-year-old leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted and replaced by his protege, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, 52. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that Politburo member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s labor federation, has called for more independence for the nation's labor unions as a step toward reform. `` I think it is better if the unions find and represent their own positions,'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said, apparently refering to the labor movement's traditional advocacy of party policies.

At least 1,000 people were reported to have been arrested earlier this month when mass demonstrations broke out in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> surrounding the 40th anniversary of East German statehood Oct. 7. Activists have complained that police used brute force to break up some of the peaceful marches, and authorities have recently promised to look into those allegations.

 Mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> sang a marvelous <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON> in <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>'s `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' on Saturday, proving she's doing what she has said she wants: quit while she's ahead. Miss <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> is singing the first five performances of `` Barber'' at the Metropolitan Opera this season, her farewell to that opera. She first sang <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON> 27 years ago in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and has decided to drop certain operas from her repertoire. Saturday afternoon's `` Barber'' was unusually amusing. It's easy to make the action too broad, but this cast, which kicked up its heels a bit more than most, just added jollity and did n't go too far. <PERSON> Paata </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchuladze </PERSON>, the Russian bass, sings with effortless richness, even on the lowest notes. In the ensemble in which he's front and center, he took charge of the stage with comic assurance but without trying to steal the show Tenor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> made a Metropolitan Opera debut as Count <LOCATION> Almaviva </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> was sick. Cousins began with some strain in coloratura passages but that subsided, and the impression he left is of a pleasing tone; it is n't a beautiful voice but it was a Met debut to note. His strongest suit is his stage demeanor; he acted the role to perfection. Two outstanding singers of the afternoon were baritones and father and son. The son, <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> Quilico </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>. He sings the role with a more finely focused tone than many and in Act 1 he presented a rather stiff <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>. But in Act 2, he loosened up and added to the fun. One hopes that he and his father enjoyed the shaving scene as much as the audience did. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quilico </PERSON> was <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>'s guardian. He sang a marvelous overstuffed but foxy gent. The orchestral music was ebullient, under the baton of <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudel </PERSON>. Baritone <PERSON> Motti </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaston </PERSON>, who has been in the Metropolitan Opera Young Artist Program, made a favorable impression in his Met debut as <LOCATION> Almaviva </LOCATION>'s servant. The <PERSON> Rossina </PERSON>, traditionally, can choose the aria to sing in the lesson scene. Miss <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> chose `` La mia pace-La mia calma,'' which probably has n't been sung since <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>'s time. It was first sung in <LOCATION> Bologne </LOCATION> in 1816 after the opera's premiere in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> earlier that year. It showcased the voice of this mezzo-soprano who will be greatly missed by connoisseurs of `` Barber.''

<HEAD>Soviets Say Economic, Social Problems Marred East Germany Under Honecker</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East German Media, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet newspaper said Sunday that economic and social problems piled up for years in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, despite glowing official press reports of the situation there. In an article titled `` G.D.R.: Fresh Air of Renewal,'' correspondent <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikitin </PERSON> of the labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> wrote the first Soviet press report on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that admits earlier reports glossed over the Soviet ally's problems. Although there had been hints of Kremlin dissatisfaction before, the Trud article contained the strongest criticism in the East German and Soviet media of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s policies. `` The mass media seemed to shut themselves off from reality and kept on reporting about achievements and overfulfilled plans,'' <PERSON> Nikitin </PERSON> wrote from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Our colleagues from the -LRB- <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -RRB- were forced, as once we were, to write about not what existed but about what one wanted to exist. On some days, for example, one could see dozens of pictures showing former First Secretary'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in the official party daily, <PERSON> Nikitin </PERSON> said. While the whitewashing continued, the correspondent wrote, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic development slowed because of too much centralized control, and `` problems in economic, social and public spheres were piling up in the republic.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77, stepped down Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader after 18 years in power. Trud noted that as soon as his replacement, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, took office, news organizations became more frank in reporting the country's problems. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> cited health reasons for resigning, but widespread dissatisfaction with his authoritarian government, which has led about 55,000 East Germans to flee West in recent weeks, had increased pressure for a change. Most Soviet press reports have criticized the fleeing East Germans, but <PERSON> Nikitin </PERSON> was sympathetic. `` The republic has suffered a big moral and material blow from the last wave of illegal emigration of tens of thousands of G.D.R. citizens'' to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he wrote. `` Mainly young people have left the country: skilled workers, scientific and technical intellectuals, medical workers. And they ran away not from poverty.'' He suggested many people left because of wage leveling, a lack of dialogue with the leadership and travel restrictions. People also were upset that they were not given information about reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the Trud correspondent wrote. `` People were informed only about earthquakes and catastrophes, inter-ethnic clashes, tea and sugar rationing. ... It seemed that somebody did not want to say the truth about reforms in the -LRB- Soviet -RRB- economy, democratization in public and political life, about formation of a real people's parliament, about other profound reforms in our country with all its problems, sufferings and hopes.''

<TEXT>
 The man who would be king could find great bargains in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> over the weekend. The Shakespeare Festival of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> held a rummage sale Saturday and Sunday to get rid of many unneeded costumes and props. A purple king's robe was going for $ 85 and upper-body armor was priced at $ 50. Body leotards decorated with leaves and flowers, worn by wood sprites in a production of `` A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' were priced at $ 10 apiece `` I came in here not thinking I was going to buy anything,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` I bought the crown not only for myself but for my two young nieces. I always enjoyed playing dress-up when I was a kid and pretending I was a princess.'' Managing director <PERSON> DeJon </PERSON> <PERSON> Malley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said the handmade costumes and other props from 15 years of festival productions were expendable because the company's plays are never presented in the same way. The sale, which included some more contemporary castoffs such as women's dresses, a hubcap and a talking teddy bear, raised about $ 2,800 in its first day. Sale proceeds will benefit the festival, which sustained a heavy financial loss when its stage was blown apart by a storm last summer. The 1990 season will offer productions of `` Pericles, Prince of Tyre'' and `` Twelfth Night.''

<TEXT>
 Days after <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for his ouster from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, parliamentarian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> has come under attack from the state-run press in a campaign reminiscent of those waged against dissidents before the glasnost era. The attacks, which came nearly every day last week, have centered on the maverick historian's harsh criticism of the party and his siding with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a territorial dispute with the Kremlin. Such repeated harsh criticism of political activists by name is rare under glasnost, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, and appears a throwback to the rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. In those days, such attacks often preceded the jailing or exiling of dissidents. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, 55, is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. In an Oct. 13 meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly accused <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> and two economists of joining with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to form `` a fascist clique striving for power.'' They men belong to a parliamentary opposition group. Informed Soviet sources said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the meeting <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> should be thrown out of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The historian was traveling out of the country Sunday and unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> was well known to intellectuals nationwide for his participation in `` Memorial,'' a group trying to build a monument and research center in memory of the victims of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s terror. He gained wider fame in a nationally televised speech in May to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. With <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> looking on, <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> said the Soviet leader had either listened to or influenced an `` aggressively obedient majority'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to elect a `` Brezhnevist-Stalinist'' Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet is the full-time legislature. The state-run press and other deputies criticized <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> for his remarks at the time. On Tuesday, the Russian party daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietsksya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> believes the official ideology of Marxism-Leninism is outmoded. It asked: `` Is n't it more honest for him to leave the party?'' On the same day, the central party daily Pravda quoted <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> as telling a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> meeting that the party has no authority and in 70 years of power has led the country nowhere. Pravda said <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, who appears frequently at rallies of unofficial political groups and speaks in a booming baritone, never backs up his charges and has turned from historian to priest. Pravda took the campaign a step further Friday with an article titled `` Irresponsibility'' _ referring to comments <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> made two days earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at a symposium on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> told the meeting he feels the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should return four islands <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants because the dispute over them, dating back to World War II, is preventing normal relations. The Soviets occupied the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, north of Hokkaido, after the end of fighting in 1945 and have refused to return them. Pravda reported <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s remarks but did not point out that he said they were his personal opinion. It told Soviet readers the Japanese have found `` among our countrymen an open and extremely active ally'' in the dispute. The capital's local party newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, joined the campaign Saturday, reprinting an article from <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s home district newspaper accusing him of trying to discredit the party.

<HEAD>Focus on Quake Aid Blurs Deficit Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will spend much of this week spending money, including billions for earthquake disaster relief, while also trying not to lose sight of the need for reducing the federal deficit. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation planned to seek an aid package Monday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act quickly. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has asked the president's budget office for an official cost estimate by Monday morning, but administration officials said Sunday more time may be required as the damage estimates from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area continue to escalate. `` It's an evolving situation ...,'' <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' program. `` I do n't think we want to jump to a number.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> on Friday said he expected that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would have to provide $ 2.5 billion in earthquake relief. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> on Sunday put the needed federal aid at $ 3.3 billion; Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., raised it to $ 3.5 billion and Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he expects the figure to rise to $ 5 billion before it's all over `` I'm sure we'll reach closure on what is a realistic number,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program, said he expected most of the earthquake aid to come from the $ 12 billion accumulated in the Federal Highway Trust Fund. But he said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should use the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo last month to call for a massive new public works program financed by an increase in gasoline taxes to repair the nation's infrastructure. `` If ever there was a moment to talk about increasing the gasoline tax, now is the moment when people have those pictures of the Nimitz Expressway still in their minds,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. `` Let's get this country fixed up.'' The initial disaster assistance was expected to become part of a stopgap spending bill required because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have failed to enact the annual appropriations for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. The government has been operating on an interim spending bill which expires Oct. 25. Full House action on the bill was expected Tuesday, with speedy <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration to follow. The costly disasters struck while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been looking for ways to reduce the federal deficit. A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee is trying to settle money disputes between the two chambers, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand for a cut in the capital gains tax rate. The House has approved a cut as part of its anti-deficit package, but opponents in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ including <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> _ kept it off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Friday he did n't think the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would pass a capital gains cut this year, and he accused those who are pushing it of being irresponsible. The continuing deficit problem will soon force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for another increase in the national debt. But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said lawmakers had to put aside their concern for the deficit when it came to providing money for the disaster victims. `` It would be very unfair to affected areas ... to say, well, we ca n't meet these obligations because we have a budget crunch,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` We have to respond.'' The talks on the deficit-reduction bill were also a victim of the earthquake, as key lawmakers had to turn their attention to the disaster. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., represents a district including the center of the quake The budget talks were expected to resume this week. Aside from the capital gains fight, lawmakers were trying to decide how to handle such touchy issues as repealing the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic health plan and expanding federal child care subsidies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto Saturday night of a $ 156.7 billion appropriation bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> departments because it liberalizes federal spending on abortion also sends that issue back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> planed to debate Monday a bill setting up a commission to study the seven-month old strike by machinists, pilots and flight attendants against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The bill is a watered-down version of a measure introduced shortly after the strike began in March _ and opposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ that would have established an emergency board empowered to recommend a way to end the walkout. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan to work on some of the regular fiscal 1990 spending bills, covering a wide range of programs including agriculture, justice and transportation. The transportation bill, as passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, includes $ 1.1 billion above what the White House recommended for anti-drug programs and the two chambers are working on a final version. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators have already agreed on another issue on the bill _ a ban on smoking on virtually all domestic flights.

 The shutdown of a shelter for earthquake victims to make room for a convention of plastic surgeons has angered some of the displaced and brought an angry defense by Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>. Most of the 1,000 people housed in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter at the huge <ORGANIZATION> Moscone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were moved Sunday to the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> army base and to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> transport ship, allowing time to prepare for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstructive </ORGANIZATION> and Plastic Surgeons' convention Oct. 30, city officials said The relocation angered residents of the <LOCATION> Tenderloin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where hundreds of elderly and impoverished people were evicted from damaged transient hotels after Tuesday's devastating 6.9-magnitude quake. `` They should have the plastic surgeons postpone it for a week and let people get over this earthquake. I'm still shaking from this quake,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Holyfield </PERSON>, 28, an unemployed man in a stained shirt and tattered green-and-yellow <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>' cap who waited outside the Moscone Center on Sunday. The center is within walking distance of the Tenderloin's cheap cafes. The Presidio and the USS Peleliu, at Pier 30, are miles away, closer to the swanky <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant and Fisherman's Wharf The city's chronically homeless, the estimated 6,000 who live year-round in doorways and warm themselves over garbage can fires, said it took a disaster for the city to open an emergency shelter. `` Why does it take an earthquake for a bum to get a cup of coffee?'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, an unemployed accountant who has slept at <ORGANIZATION> Moscone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since the quake. `` The shelter, it's a luxury,'' said <LOCATION> Holyfield </LOCATION>, who slept on the street until the quake raised his standard of living by making a cot available in the convention hall ballroom. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> disputed the accusations that the city does not normally provide adequate shelter. He said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> already pays for 2,900 hotel rooms a night and that the city needs convention and tourist revenue to finance a new $ 17 million program to create 3,000 additional dwellings for the poor within a year. `` This industry is the financial life blood of the city. We wo n't have the money to pay for the permanent solutions,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said Sunday, as he headed into a quake-damaged City Hall closed to the public. The hotel tax brings in $ 80 million a year. The tourist industry is the city's largest single revenue source and employer, said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nothenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s chief administrative officer. Red Cross officials at the <LOCATION> Moscone </LOCATION> shelter, where 1,043 people slept Saturday night, said the homeless had to be moved because the center has no showers or working kitchen. `` It is a hot political issue. I ca n't fathom it,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaubinger </PERSON>, evening manager. `` It does n't really conform to <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> standards for a shelter.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, pastor of Glide Memorial Church in the Tenderloin, where volunteers have served 5,000 meals a day since the quake, denounced the proposed move in his Sunday sermon. `` I know that in a stress group that began Friday, the most stressful thing they taked about was that they were going to be removed,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in an interview before the service. According to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' survey of hotels, 1,500 to 2,000 elderly, disabled and poor residents were evicted when the city closed at least five large transient hotels and parts of others after the quake. Many of these were the same hotels where city government provided nighttime shelter to the homeless. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Agnos, noted the different treatment accorded Tenderloin homeless and the 1,000 people who until Sunday were housed at the <ORGANIZATION> Marina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the affluent district devastated by the quake. In one practice, dubbed `` red tagging,'' citizens offered showers and beds to people who'd lost homes in the quake _ as long as they could prove homelessness by showing a red tag, the official notice allowing them to search their Marina apartments. `` What it means is that they're from the Marina,'' said <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, visibly angry over the apparently discriminatory practice. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> made a public appeal for every church in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to take in 25 people, mainly mothers and children. `` It's time to rock the mother and the child in our bosom,'' he said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official, said buses began moving people from the <LOCATION> Moscone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> to the Presidio at midday. They expected 500 to 1,000 people to be relocated there. They will be housed in two buildings, one for the general population, the second for families and the elderly. Single men will be housed on the ship.

 The earthquake-crippled Bay area braced for a gigantic traffic jam Monday, and officials appealed for commuters to use car pools, trains or ferries, switch their hours or work from home. `` Because of the stage of emergency ... if we find ourselves with a single-person vehicle with any alternative, then they're doing an anti-social act,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a regionwide planning agency Some 3 million people in the <LOCATION> nine-county </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area commute daily on an average weekday, according to the commission which predicts 2 million of those will probably encounter delays of some kind. Monday is the first real business day for many thousands since the quake. At least 65,000 people who normally enter <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> at rush hour in cars or buses must find other routes because the artery was severed. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which runs trains in a tube beneath the bay, should pick up 35,000 of them and ferries can handle 10,000. That leaves 20,000 to try car and van pools across the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> to the south or the <LOCATION> Richmond-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in the north. `` We expect it's going to be extremely crowded,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouber </PERSON> on Sunday. `` I would say that it's going to be a jam-up probably.'' The system, which normally shuts from midnight to 6 a.m., will run 24 hours. Transit officials urged businesses to implement `` flex hours,'' in which an employee can report to work at staggered times and avoid commute rush-hours. They asked anyone able to work from home to do that. The devastation to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s roadways was tremendous, and long-term. The eight-mile-long Bay Bridge will be closed at least a month while a 50-foot section is replaced. Last Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake also collapsed a 1.25-mile section of Interstate 880, the <LOCATION> Nimitz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>, killing dozens of people. It had carried 170,000 vehicles per day, but will now likely be closed for years. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the Embarcadero Freeway suffered severe damage. The 1.2-mile elevated freeway, which connects downtown with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and Fisherman's Wharf, will be closed for months. So will a five-mile stretch of Interstate 280 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 101 to Sixth Street. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, near the quake's epicenter, State Highway 17 was closed because of landslides and mudslides. That important link for 20,000 people who commute to work in the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> will be closed to general traffic for an undetermined time, although one line will be opened for buses and emergency vehicles. Ferry service around the Bay has been expanded, with added stops at the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> <PERSON> Square </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Three ferries, capable of carrying at least 250 people each, were supposed to arrive from Puget Sound in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Wednesday. But on Sunday, those boats were still docked because of inclement weather. A ferry boat from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and 20 small <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels are available to help transport commuters later in the week.

 Black leader <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, one of eight political prisoners freed from prison last week, said Sunday that President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> must `` wash the blood'' from his hands before he will speak to him. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, 80, who was the nation's oldest political prisoner, also called on <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to free all political prisoners and legalize opposition parties. Men, women and children huddled together under cold, gray skies to listen to <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, a one-legged, partially blind diabetic, who remained seated throughout his speech. `` I ca n't speak to de Klerk. His hands are bloody,'' the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader told about 8,000 people at a stadium. `` He must first wash the blood off his hands and feet.'' <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> was the first of the freed prisoners to appear at a public rally. He was sentenced to five years in prison in 1985 after being convicted of terrorism. `` Today is not just another day, not just aother rally. It is a rally of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, and we have come to welcome the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leadership,'' local civil rights lawyer <PERSON> Bulelani </PERSON> <PERSON> Ncuka </PERSON> told the crowd. Attorney <PERSON> Dulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, regional chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid movement, said the purpose of the rally was to `` unban the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'' as well as to welcome <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting the white-led government, was banned in 1960. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, who says he still retains the title of president of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in the western <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, was flanked on the platform by six elderly <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> men who were brought to the rally in an ambulance. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> said a symbolic cleansing for <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> would involve releasing all political prisoners, allowing exiles to return safely to the country and legalizing the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. `` When he wipes his hands, this will be a sign,'' <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> said. He also said that <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> must be freed to address the people. `` Then only will I accompany Comrade <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> President in exile -RRB- Comrade <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>'' to talks with the government, <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> said to resounding cheers. All the speakers stressed that the release of the eight prisoners last week did not mean an end to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military activity, and they called on the government to cease violence through the army and police. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> had said in a speech Saturday that all organizations could be part of negotiations for an end to apartheid and the inclusion of the black majority in national government if they were committed to peaceful solutions. There was no visible police presence at the rally, except for a helicopter that hovered briefly.

 The parishioners of St. Francis de Sales Cathedral were without a house of worship Sunday, their century-old church tower filled with cracks and leaning precariously, but the congregation's faith was unmoved. On Sunday, entry to the Catholic church was barred by barbed wire fences and parishioners had to say Mass down the street at a Baptist church. `` I need to cry. I need to let go,'' said <PERSON> Ona </PERSON> <PERSON> Solom </PERSON>, an acolyte of the church. `` It's a heavy burden on the heart. But we're grateful to come here. `` A building is important,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>. `` But people _ they're more important.'' As about 100 parishioners gathered for the service, some automatically looked _ in vain _ for familiar seats. `` Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says ` Pay attention, there is something more important than the ordinary things in your life,''' Father <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> told the worshipers. Religious groups in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area were coordinating activities after the earthquake, taking collections and enlisting volunteers to help their congregations and other earthquake victims. A group of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches has started a counseling service in which ministers will visit those who call feeling anxious.

 Repairs to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> began Sunday when a huge crane hefted half of the damaged upper deck section off the lower roadway and smoothly lowered it onto a barge 200 feet below. But today's task, just the beginning of work expected to take at least a month, offers no relief to the gridlock expected when the work week resumes Monday. It was unclear whether officials would try to remove a second 100-ton section of collapsed roadway Sunday or wait until Monday. Officials say it will cost up to $ 1 million to repair the 53-year-old bridge, damaged spectacularly in Tuesday's earthquake. Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the upper deck dangling like an open trap door, provided the first graphic illustration of the magnitude of the quake. One woman died when she drove her car into the gap. The bridge had also been in the logo created for the 1989 World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> since it links the two cities. But its closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay resumption of the championship until Friday, as officials attempt to reduce traffic problems. The 8.5-mile-long bridge carries 260,000 vehicles per day, and the only alternatives are other jammed bridges, overloaded mass transit systems and a makeshift fleet of ferry boats. The dangerous and painstaking task of lifting the heavy section of roadway out of the damaged area and then lowering it to the barge at bay level went without a hitch Sunday. `` Good planning,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. `` It sounds like they made it look easy.'' Also to be replaced is the section of lower roadway that took the brunt of the impact when the upper level fell open. The lifting and lowering of the damaged section took only 20 minutes, and cables prevented the section from swaying in light winds. The entire upper section measures 74 feet long and 50 feet wide and weighs about 200 tons, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The numbers were modifications of previous <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcements. The section was cut in half by concrete saws and blow torches beginning Saturday to make it easier to move, she said. State officials hope they can repair and reinstall the upper span, she said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schott </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said the repairs should not cause any additional damage to the bridge. `` We are doing nothing more than putting it back together the way it was built in the first place,'' he said. Officials are urging commuters to use mass transit, car pools or ferries while the bridge is closed, but everyone is predicting traffic nightmares. `` Monday morning will be a zoo on traffic,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> has spent the nights since the earthquake in the back of her father's truck with her 8-month-old baby and other family members. `` It's just scary. I think another disaster is going to happen,'' said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, 20. `` The little kids are afraid of going into any building.'' Four walls and a roof overhead no longer mean security in this predominantly Hispanic community, where residents are mindful of what happened in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> four years ago. Thousands died in a tremendous earthquake on Sept. 19, 1985, but many others were killed by an aftershock the next day that trapped them inside their homes. Now the only place many in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> feel safe is among the forgiving canvas walls of tents, and not even the driving rains that have turned their campsites to mud have persuaded them into shelters or back to homes that the city has declared safe to enter. `` The biggest problem we find is that they are families and the children for the most part are frightened to death to go in buildings,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Svennigsen </PERSON>, part of a team from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health services that is helping with relief efforts, said Saturday. `` They are willing to bear up under the cold and rain and everything else to keep the children from screaming as they go into houses,'' he said. <PERSON> Raymundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> is one of those who fear another tremor could topple the weakened walls of his house, killing anyone foolish enough to be inside. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey says there have already been more than 2,000 aftershocks, with more expected in the next few days that could cause additional damage. After Tuesday's quake, as soon as he could get to a working telephone line, <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> called his grandparents in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> who had survived their own powerful earthquake. `` Everyone was crying. They said they were happy to hear from me because they thought <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> was gone,'' <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> said. `` They thought it was going to happen, the same thing that happened in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. I did, too.'' <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, located about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, is not gone, but uncounted homes and businesses are destroyed. Amazingly, only one of the 30,000 residents was killed, the victim of a bakery collapse. Volunteers estimate 500 people have been sleeping in the half-dozen tent cities that have popped up in parks and empty lots, all near areas where the damage has been especially severe. Many others are sleeping in their yards or cars rather than enter homes whose foundations have shifted, porches have collapsed or chimneys have caved in roofs. Three Red Cross shelters are already at capacity with 1,100 homeless who are willing to stay inside. On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> opened a full-blown shelter of olive drab military tents in <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, complete with medical and feeding facilities for those sleeping on cots. `` It's unusual, but this was something we felt we had to do because of peoples' concerns,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. The tent cities have become relief centers where volunteers from throughout the region serve meals and coffee from the backs of trucks. Donated clothes are piled under sheets of plastic and anchored by scrap lumber. And the homeless, wearing garbage bags to stay dry, wait in long lines for food, for tents and for diapers. They wait for anything but a roof over their heads. Others, apparently without even a tent, push shopping carts full of belongings through the streets. `` This place is a disaster,'' <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> human resources agency, said as she tried to coax 50 survivors living in <LOCATION> Calaghan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to move to 22 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tents erected several blocks away by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are everywhere on the streets in this town,'' <PERSON> Cote </PERSON> said. `` A lot of this is cultural, they do n't want to leave their houses, they are afraid people are going to go in houses and take things.'' Even building inspectors' word that 363 homes have been checked and are safe to enter has n't appeared to sway many whose confidence in even the ground beneath their feet was shaken by the 15-second jolt. `` There's this distrust of government because a lot of people are here illegally and they do n't want to be turned in,'' <PERSON> Cote </PERSON> said. `` We are giving services regardless. The INS is not going to show up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said benefits would be provided to all victims regardless of citizenship. `` There is no indication on the application whether they are a citizen or not,'' he said. `` Disaster victims are disaster victims.'' City spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> said no attempt will be made to ban camping until all homes are inspected and it is determined who was left truly homeless. Workers so far have marked 330 homes unsafe to enter near the hard-hit downtown area where officials expect to raze an entire block of businesses, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. That total is expected to rise dramatically as workers travel into the outskirts of town, she said.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The premier of hard-line <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> said in remarks published Sunday that the reforms crushed by Soviet troops in the 1968 invasion contained `` positive elements'' but were wrong for the times. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> hinted that his country's leadership may re-evaluate the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms, which have been officially scorned as a `` counterrevolution.'' `` We have now a new generation that knows nothing about 1968 and will view it with new eyes,'' he said. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s comments came in interviews with Austrian journalists in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. He was to arrive in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Monday for an official visit. While he spoke favorably of the 1968 reform program of disgraced former leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also reaffirmed the supremacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in his country. In assessing the 1968 reforms, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said: `` The action program had a whole series of positive elements. ... I do not slander <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and the others.'' He said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and his associates `` simply had no strength to cope with the problems'' of the time. He did not elaborate in quoted remarks in the Austrian reports. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> ruled out any challenge to Communist rule in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` Should criticism be geared to the liquidation of the socialist system, we will not accept this,'' he said. Commenting on recent changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said stability `` based on absolute obedience is not good.'' He said the replacement of East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, a hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> ousted last week amid mass protests for reform, `` should have come earlier.'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also said 70 East German refugees demanding permission to go to the West via the West German mission in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> `` have a guarantee that they may emigrate.'' While leaders of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have been making democratic reforms unprecedented in the Soviet-led East bloc, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have resisted change. Hungarian Communists have dissolved their party and formed a new one that professes democratic values, and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has formed a government led by non-Communist labor leaders. On reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said: `` The Hungarians can have as many parties as they want. I admit, our Communist Party has also made mistakes. But for that reason it is not necessary to liquidate a party right away _ only because it has made mistakes.'' Of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said: `` I was recently in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. I step off the plane, and there is a strike in the whole city -LRB- of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> -RRB-. No cars, no streetcars, the shops closed. `` The government chief has apologized: He has no beer, because the strike has paralyzed transportation. Everything stands still. Is that supposed to be an example for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>?''

 An air force fighter plane that was performing air stunts crashed into a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of this port city Sunday, killing nine people, officials said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was driving when she got into an altercation with a motorcycle officer failed to bring her minimum asking price of $ 125,000 when it was unexpectedly offered at an auction. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said she had not intended to sell the white 1980 Corniche convertible, but was talked into it Saturday when she and her husband visited the auction at a hotel in <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> where another <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> they owned went for $ 80,000. `` Nothing was arranged. But when we drove by, the auctioneer said, ` Would you like to sell that, too?'

But the bids rose no higher than $ 105,000, offered by a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> car dealer. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> drove off to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, still in possession of the car. `` I love that car,'' she said. The market rate for the Corniche is $ 70,000 to $ 80,000, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fineman </PERSON>, a spokesman for Spectrum Auctions, whose firm conducts occasional auctions for high-priced cars. `` It's obviously worth $ 105,000 to me because <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> owned it,'' said top bidder <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>. The Hungarian-born actress was driving the vehicle when she was pulled over by <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> last June. She is to be sentenced Tuesday on her misdemeanor convictions of slapping <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, driving without a valid license and carrying an open container of liquor in her car. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> had said she was determined to find a buyer because she feared the Rolls would make her a target for police. `` I'm afraid to drive it in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> now,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to buy American cars from now on. You know the new red Cadillacs? That's what I want.''

<TEXT>
 A fire that charred nearly 11,000 acres in three counties appeared tamed Sunday under a light rain, but firefighters kept a wary eye out for flareups. `` If we did n't know anything about <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> weather, we'd say it was out and go home,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said of the fire, which began Wednesday at this Marine base and spread to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> wilderness area in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. It charred land in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> counties. `` You'd be hard-pressed to see anything even smoldering. But the problem is, until you get a couple days' sun on it, you're not sure where it's still hot,'' <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON> said. `` All it takes is one root or one stump still smoldering that we do n't notice, and the winds come up, and it's off and running again.'' The blaze, which had not advanced since Friday, was declared 65 percent contained on Sunday. No structures had burned. Some residents of the nearby <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrillo </LOCATION> housing tract in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> temporarily evacuated their homes as smoke and dust from the fire filled the air on Friday, <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON> said. The rain has been both a hindrance and a help to the 900 firefighters on the line. Although it has helped keep the fire from advancing, it has turned dirt roads in the area to mud. Three firefighters were injured, one with a dislocated shoulder, another with a cut knee and a third who complained of chest pains, <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Sunday he does n't foresee a change in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation presidential primary `` I think the impact of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> has probably been _ as far as the national outcome is concerned _ has probably been grossly overestimated by political pundits,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to address about 200 Democratic leaders. `` Going first is good ... but I'm not sure that it has such a profound impact over who the ultimate nominees of the party are going to be,'' he said. Both the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus to select delegates are held in late February or early March and are the first tests of presidential candidate strength. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he does not advocate any radical changes in the nominating process, which has been criticized by members of both parties who say the two states have too much influence in determining presidential candidates. However, he said it was good for other states _ such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which is seeking to move its primary from June to March _ to move up their primary dates if they are frustrated with how the field of candidates has narrowed by the time they get to vote. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledged the Republican dominance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> holds all four congressional seats, the governor's office and all five Executive Council seats _ but pledged the national committee's support in helping get Democrats elected in 1990. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the seat being vacated by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> is a good opportunity for Democrats, as they would not be running against an incumbent.

 Two homemade bombs exploded in a stadium during a soccer match Sunday and injured 14 people, including two police officers, authorities said. A police spokesman said six people were arrested in connection with the blasts. Earlier in the day, police had said 19 people were injured. The incident occurred during the first half of the match between the teams <ORGANIZATION> Ajax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Feijenoord </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>. The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two explosive devices were hurled from the Feijenoord sections of the grandstands. `` They looked like light fragmentation bombs, fireworks with some scrap metal,'' the police spokesman said. Security was increased at the stadium last month after the goalkeeper of an Austrian team was hit by a steel bar thrown from the grandstands. It was not known how the explosive devices were smuggled in. After the explosions, police evacuated two sections of the stadium. No further incidents were reported during the match, which ended in a 1-1 draw.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has assured <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has no claims to its territory in comments that pave the way for a summit <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> hopes will end 50 years of troubled relations. Nearly one-third of present-day <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was part of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before World War II. That land and the ethnic Germans living there have continued to strain relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has in recent months tried to ease tensions with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> conquered 50 years ago. He has renounced all territorial claims and pressed instead for improved conditions for the ethnic German minority in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Saturday, the chancellor reiterated in a speech to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Organization of German Exiles that `` the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> raises no territorial or border claims'' against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The organization includes survivors from among the 12 million people driven from their homelands after World War II. In his speech, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> referred to the 1970 Treaty of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> recognizes the Oder-Neisse river boundaries as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s western frontier. He said his government `` adheres to the letter and spirit of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> in all its parts.''

<TEXT>
 The Lebanese parliament on Sunday passed a power-sharing accord intended to end the country's 14-year-old civil war, but <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the pact Fifty-nine of 62 deputies present voted for the draft charter but made their action contingent on approval by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his rival, Moslem leader <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. Two deputies abstained, and one voted against the agreement. `` What the deputies approved in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> is a crime I will not accept,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said at a news conference at the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I have demanded a Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but they came up with a peace plan full of ambiguities about this issue, which constitutes <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. His rejection put the future of the plan in doubt. There was no immediate reaction from the Lebanese lawmakers, who retired immediately after their late-night session. The Christian deputies had consulted with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> by telephone before announcing they intended to vote for the plan. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s lawmakers have been meeting in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> since Sept. 30 under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting abroad was designed to remove them from scene of the fighting. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he could accept the political reforms in the proposed accord, which would give more power to the Moslems, but `` the deputies have actually exceeded their jurisdiction and constitutional rights by voting in these ambiguities that compromise <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. I reject this plan and reject the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> approval of it.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not say what he meant by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss the peace plan. `` We're going to withhold comment until things are pinned down a little bit more,'' a White House official said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads a Lebanese Christian government competing for legitimacy with the predominately <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. There was no immediate reaction from <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also said that if the Syrians threaten to resume fierce shelling that battered <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from March to September, his troops were ready for battle. The general proposed putting the peace plan to a referendum of the Lebanese people. `` If they support me, I shall lead them to achieve <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty Otherwise, I will reliquish authority,'' he said. As the parliamentary session began in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for separate talks with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. Despite <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s comments later, <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> told reporters he was pleased there had been no new fighting in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He also said he hoped `` the atmosphere of optimism and the steps that have begun materializing will continue to ensure the interests of the Lebanese people and end their plight.'' The proposal falls short of Christian demands for a full pullout of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within three years, but includes Syrian proposals for at least a partial withdrawal. It also guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians in the Parliament. There now are 33 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies and 30 Moslem deputies. The Parliament session, the first since Oct. 5, was called after <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> guaranteed it would be carried out, and the Christians consulted with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and said they had no reservations. `` We've reached final and comprehensive agreement,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. When news of the agreement spread, the hotel where negotiations were held flung open its banquet halls and served sharbat, the sweet drink reserved for weddings and other special occasions. The deputies hugged and congratulated each other as they gathered in the conference hall, with one absent due to heart problems. Only 73 deputies of the last parliament elected in 1972 remain alive; 10 have boycotted the proceedings. <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem deputy, said the deputies `` achieved a historic mission today for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the Arab world.'' Under the peace plan, the first step in the Syrian withdrawal would be to move Syrian troops out of a .6 - mile _ or one-kilometer _ radius around <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before the legislative body convened to ratify political changes and elect a new <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been without a president since September 1988, when <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended and legislators were unable to decide on a successor. The plan, brokered by the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> foreign minister, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON>, calls for the Syrians to be replaced inside the `` security zone'' by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police backed by Algerian and Moroccan observers, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The plan does not set a date for a final withdrawal of Syrian troops from east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> _ a persistent Christian demand. Instead of a fixed deadline for the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> withdrawal, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> agreed that the issue be handled by a Syrian-Lebanese military committee after political reforms are ratified, a president is elected and a unified government formed. Moslems have argued that the Syrian presence is their only guarantee political reforms will be carried out. Under the peace plan, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would be increased to 108 seats, equally divided between Moslems and Christians. The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> currently has 99 seats, and their had been disagreement over proposals to increase it to 128 seats. When <PERSON> Lebanon </PERSON> received independence in 1943, the majority Christians were given a 6-to-5 advantage over Moslems in all government posts. Moslems now make up just more than 50 percent of the nation's population. Sources said deputies asked <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> for guarantees the plan will be implemented. The sources said <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> agreed to provide a clarification or statement that would alleviate their concern. Syrian troops were sent into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to quell the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the Syrian troops violated that mandate by siding with Moslems in the war. He launched a `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in March. More than 900 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in six months of savage shelling duels that ended with an Arab League-sponsored cease-fire Sept. 22.

 Activists opposed to the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> capped a week of protests by demonstrating Sunday near the summer home of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area. `` We know he will get the message,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. Protesters in a crowd estimated by police to be 125 to 150 waved flags and signs and shouted anti-nuclear slogans. Organizers of the rally said they planned no civil disobedience Sunday. Last Saturday, some 475 arrests were made as hundreds of activists climbed the fence at the plant in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, so they could be picked up for trespassing. <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said that the protesters had caused no problems. <PERSON> Ehrenberg </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> and other local officials were cooperative as the demonstrators arranged their rally. The plant, completed in 1986 and owned by a dozen utilities, lacks a commercial operating license because of challenges to evacuation plans for surrounding communities in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The fate of an operating license for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is pending with the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but the opponents include <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who has vowed to fight the license in federal court. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the plant `` has been the most closely studied nuclear plant ever licensed and the experts have concluded that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> station is safe.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 shook violently and seemed to plunge just before it crashed in flames into a hillside, killing 131 people, a badly burned survivor said Sunday. `` They told us to put on our seatbelts for landing, and then suddenly the plane began to shake, like air turbulence,'' said <PERSON> Evenor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a Honduran businessman. `` But it went on for a long time, and we seemed to be descending too rapidly. Some people were screaming,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said in an interview. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> arrived Sunday from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane and went directly to the site of Saturday's crash. The plane was operated by the Honduran airline TAN-SAHSA. Authorities said 131 of the 146 people aboard were killed. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said there were 15 Americans aboard. Airline officials said three of the 15 survivors were American. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> issued partial lists of fatalities with no hometowns or ages for many of the victims. They included: <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Paglia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine stationed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurista </PERSON>, 37, Prairie Farms, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Apodaca </PERSON>, 49, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Apodaca </PERSON>, 50, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Friederich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebb </PERSON>, 42, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> employee; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Montealegre </PERSON>, 68; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said he could not identify other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens until relatives were notified. The plane's `` black box'' recorder was flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for analysis, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> team. TAN-SAHSA Flight 414 crashed Saturday morning on a hill 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> while on a flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, with a stop in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Maj. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civil aeronautics, quoted regional air controllers as saying the roof of the plane tore away before the crash. It was the worst air crash in Central American history. Among the dead were the Honduran Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> <PERSON> Paniagua </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cubero </PERSON>, an aide to Costa Rican president <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. `` I was asleep, and when I woke up we were on the ground,'' said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 30-year-old Nicaraguan who runs a restaurant in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, with her husband. `` I was buckled into my seat, and I heard some people helping somebody behind me. Everything was on fire and I yelled, ` Do n't leave me!' Pilot <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> was one of the survivors. Doctors said all were in stable condition. Two Americans, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaeffer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, were evacuated to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> as an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and said he was taken to a burn center at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The hometowns of <PERSON> Shaeffer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> were not available. The other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> survivor, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was being treated for a broken ankle and burns. Hundreds of people gathered at <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>'s morgue Sunday as doctors continued the slow task of identifying charred bodies. Among them were relatives of Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> passengers who rushed to <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> after receiving word of the crash. The cause of the crash was still not clear. Speculation centered on the plane's age, more than 20 years, and on bad weather at <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Toncontin </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said that despite the turbulence, he thought the plane was headed for a normal landing until the moment of the crash. He said he could n't see the ground because of the clouds. `` I was on fire when the plane stopped. I tell you, I thought I was going to die. But I unbuckled my seat belt and I walked out of the plane, it was all open,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` I put myself out with my hands and walked to a house I saw about a block away,'' he said.

 Atlantis' astronauts went to bed ahead of schedule Sunday night after <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> told them to come home three hours early Monday to avoid high winds at the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> landing site. After spending the day stowing their gear, testing the shuttle's steering system and packing up experiments, the five crew members said good night to <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> shortly before 9 p.m. EDT _ 2 -LCB- hours earlier than planned `` This will be our last time with you hopefully,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an astronaut serving as a spacecraft communicator at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` You guys have done a superb job, and we'll see you tomorrow back in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.'' Atlantis Commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> thanked the flight control team working Sunday night, the same crew that helped the astronauts deploy the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe. `` I think we'll all, as the years pass and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> journeys toward Jupiter, look back on this one as something that was accomplished by a great team working together,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> earlier worked out a plan to land one orbit early but decided after looking at the forecast Sunday to cut short the five-day mission by two 90-minute orbits and land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at 9:33 a.m. PDT. Cable News Network was planning live coverage of the landing Monday, and spokeswomen for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said the networks would provide live coverage in the event of an unusual landing. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had not finalized its plans as of late Sunday, said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vecchione </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswomen. The shuttle's main business _ sending the $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe on its way to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> _ was accomplished 6 -LCB- hours after liftoff Wednesday. The craft operated flawlessly nearly 900,000 miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. In relaying the decision to return early, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported the <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> forecast called for afternoon winds gusting to 35 mph, too high for shuttle safety rules, which limit crosswinds to 18 mph and headwinds to 29 mph. At the new landing time, headwind gusts to no more than about 23 mph were forecast, flight director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> said Sunday. Crosswinds are not a problem, because the astronauts have six runways to choose from at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>. `` Everything looks real good,'' <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> said. `` ` The crew is in fine shape. The orbiter is in good shape also, we're not working any problems. -LRB- We're -RRB- just looking at the weather tomorrow at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, and we do n't expect a problem there either.'' Asked in a news conference from space if the winds concerned him, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> replied, `` We have no concern about flying it right out to those limits because we know it's been done before and it's been done safely. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who flew on a shuttle mission in 1985, described what re-entry through the atmosphere will be like in the interview with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` Re-entry heating is rather spectacular if you see it in the darkness. ... It looks like you're inside a fire looking out,'' he said. Another crew member, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>, spoke of the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe sent on a six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage to explore the colossus of the solar system. `` We all certainly breathed a sigh of relief when it went according to plan and we kept hearing all the good news from the ground that the spacecraft had done all the things that it had to do to get on its way,'' he said. To get ready for the return home, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> tested Atlantis' flight control systems and fired one of its steering thrusters. They reported all ready to support the fiery dash through the atmosphere and landing. Mission specialists <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> began packing up materials processing, medical, plant growth and other experiments and stowing cameras and other gear. To adjust their body clocks to the earlier landing, the crew went to bed 90 minutes early on Saturday and 2 -LCB- hours earlier Sunday.

 The formal search for DC-10 engine parts ended with new discoveries Sunday and investigators said they expect farmers to find more pieces of the disabled jetliner along the flight path in northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The jumbo jet, which lost its hydraulic flight controls July 19 in the breakup of its tail-mounted engine north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>, crashed in flames in an attempted landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing 112 of the 296 people aboard. Volunteers using metal detectors Sunday found a fragment of a fan blade from the No. 2 engine of Flight 232 and a piece of a track for engine ball bearings, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a flight safety investigator for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engines </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, search parties north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> found two blade retainers that were part of the engine rotors and a part of the hydraulic pump. Such discoveries help investigators `` tell the story of the chain of events in the failure,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. But one key part still was missing as volunteers from metal detector clubs returned to their homes in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and surrounding states. The searchers did not locate a flange that connected the forward fan shaft to the disc in the aft engine. Of the engine pieces still missing, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the flange is the `` thing most important'' to investigators. While GE ended the formal search, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he expected parts to come in from farmers who have yet to complete their field work. `` There's one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary path of fragments we've found,'' he said Sunday night. Along with the airplane debris, searchers also found artifacts from more than a century of farming and rural living. <PERSON> Konny </PERSON> <PERSON> Droegmiller </PERSON> said Sunday that the sleigh bells, spiked horse shoes and a sledge hammer wo n't help solve the mystery of the crash of Flight 232, but that she's glad to have them. `` The biggest thing for me was an old brass sleigh bell that still rings,'' she said. `` And there's not any rust on it. Now who knows how long that had been out there,'' she said. The search, paid for by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, followed a hunt by more than 100 members of metal detector clubs last weekend. The biggest reward this weekend was the $ 1,000 paid Sunday for the discovery of a set of `` mid-span shrouds for a fan blade.'' GE offered more than $ 270,000 in rewards for various parts. The largest single award of $ 119,000 was claimed this month when <PERSON> Droegmiller </PERSON>'s neighbor, farmer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, found most of the rear engine fan disc. The rest of the disc was found on the nearby farm of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON>, who received about $ 40,000.

 The formal search for DC-10 engine parts ended with new discoveries Sunday and investigators said they expect farmers to find more pieces of the disabled jetliner along the flight path in northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The jumbo jet, which lost its hydraulic flight controls July 19 in the breakup of its tail-mounted engine north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>, crashed in flames in an attempted landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing 112 of the 296 people aboard. Volunteers using metal detectors Sunday found a fragment of a fan blade from the No. 2 engine of Flight 232 and a piece of a track for engine ball bearings, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a flight safety investigator for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engines </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, search parties north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> found two blade retainers that were part of the engine rotors and a part of the hydraulic pump. Such discoveries help investigators `` tell the story of the chain of events in the failure,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. But one key part still was missing as volunteers from metal detector clubs returned to their homes in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and surrounding states. The searchers did not locate a flange that connected the forward fan shaft to the disc in the aft engine. Of the engine pieces still missing, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the flange is the `` thing most important'' to investigators. While GE ended the formal search, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he expected parts to come in from farmers who have yet to complete their field work. `` There's one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary path of fragments we've found,'' he said Sunday night. Along with the airplane debris, searchers also found artifacts from more than a century of farming and rural living. <PERSON> Konny </PERSON> <PERSON> Droegmiller </PERSON> said Sunday that the sleigh bells, spiked horse shoes and a sledge hammer wo n't help solve the mystery of the crash of Flight 232, but that she's glad to have them. `` The biggest thing for me was an old brass sleigh bell that still rings,'' she said. `` And there's not any rust on it. Now who knows how long that had been out there,'' she said. The search, paid for by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, followed a hunt by more than 100 members of metal detector clubs last weekend. The biggest reward this weekend was the $ 1,000 paid Sunday for the discovery of a set of `` mid-span shrouds for a fan blade.'' GE offered more than $ 270,000 in rewards for various parts. The largest single award of $ 119,000 was claimed this month when <PERSON> Droegmiller </PERSON>'s neighbor, farmer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, found most of the rear engine fan disc.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Sunday he is not stalling the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process, and his aides said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are holding intense negotiations on future talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s statements came amid reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is disillusioned over the slow pace of negotiations and may soon focus more attention on other world problems. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old girl in a clash with stone-throwing youths, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that troops opened fire on stone-throwers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Bala </PERSON>. He said said the military was investigating hospital reports that the teen-ager, identified as <PERSON> Sana </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeina </PERSON>, was killed by the gunfire. Also Sunday, <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Laila </PERSON>, 18, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> died of wounds suffered in a Saturday clash with troops, hospital officials said. The latest deaths raised to 600 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops or civilians in the 22-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Forty Israelis also have been slain. On Sunday, an Israeli driving near the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was seriously wounded in the head in a stone-throwing incident. In an address to activists in his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` I asked the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not to pay attention to those that insinuate that I am running away from the peace initiative.'' `` I'll say it now, and I'll say it 1,000 times,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` That is a lie because the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and I within it are for a true peace that will serve our security and interests.'' He was speaking at a rally in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday night to discuss the peace process. The U.S.-Israeli contacts were reported as <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s governing partners in the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> threatened to support a parliamentary motion to topple the coalition Cabinet unless he showed more flexibility with the Americans. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in urging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials not to be frustrated with the pace of talks. He, too, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was aggressively pursuing negotiations. `` I think that Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also realizes that advancing peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> requires patience,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television's Arabic language service. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied reports that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to arrange preliminary talks between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives had broken down in disagreement over who the Arab negotiators would be. `` This is not true. We are at the height of negotiations with the Americans,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. His comments follow an exchange of public criticism between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, started by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s declaration last week that he could not be pressured by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to enter talks with Palestinians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> so far has dismissed efforts by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to arrange a meeting with Palestinians on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s stalled proposal for elections in the occupied territories. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan for a meeting with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation would leave open a role for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views as a terrorist group. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived Sunday in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for talks with Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in remarks reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, described <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as `` Mr. No.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also has rejected the American and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposals, saying they are designed to impose <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election plan on the Palestinians <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied reports in Israeli newspapers Sunday that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is pushing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for a quick reply to his proposals. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s initiative, introduced in April, calls for elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands to choose representatives for peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on interim self-rule. The final status of the territories would be decided in later talks.

 It was a battle of two chess champions _ one active and outspoken, known to sip tonic water during matches, the other sitting quietly on a desk, taking in a different kind of juice. World chess champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who has n't lost a tournament since 1981, met Deep Thought, the winner of this year's World Computer Chess Championship, for two games Sunday The human won both games. `` I'm very happy I could do in both games what I wanted,'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said. `` In the first game, with black, I played quietly. In the second game, I tried to crush it in the opening.'' The computer retired from the first game after <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s 52nd move and 2 -LCB- hours of play. After that victory, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said: `` I expected it. It's a good player but without position and experience.'' Playing white in the second game, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> took Deep Thought's queen in move 18 The computer hung on; surrendering after 37 moves and 2 hours. `` I think the computer needs to be taught something _ how to resign,'' said the 26-year-old Soviet. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said after the first game he realized early on that he would win when the computer missed some tactical opportunities and was not able to analyze all of the champion's decisions. `` I do n't mind who's sitting opposite me,'' said <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who lives in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` If a computer should win, of course, I would have to challenge it to protect the human race.'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who helped create the computer program at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said it appeared there was a bug in the computer during the matches. `` It was n't looking at the right moves,'' he said. `` It was n't given a chance to show its best style of play. Chess commentator <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, who helped arrange the match, said before the games that Deep Thought was `` clearly the first chess computer with the potential to draw blood and defeat the world champion.'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> predicted the computer would make moves <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> might not expect. But it was <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s moves that caught the computer by surprise. One of several hundred spectators, chess grand master <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, complained that computers are `` killing the creativity of chess. A lot of the beauty of chess is coming up with an original and beautiful idea. Now, with computers, everything is known.'' Nine-year-old <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Marez </PERSON> <PERSON> Oyens </PERSON> disagreed. He has been playing against computers for three years _ and prefers them to human counterparts. `` When you play it, it's always a good game, even if you lose,'' he said, predicting that human chess skills will improve because of computers. Deep Thought, created by five graduate students at <LOCATION> Carnegie-Mellon </LOCATION>, can analyze possible 700,000 positions on the chessboard per second and five to 20 moves ahead by each side, as well as discern each move's implications. Deep Thought evaluates the millions of possible board positions created by each sequence of five moves it imagines. It assigns a numerical value to the positions created by each sequence, and moves toward positions with the highest values. The computer did n't even have to travel for the match; it remained in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> with a telephone line to relay its moves to a computer terminal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where someone moved the chess pieces on a board. <PERSON> Feng-Hsiung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>, who designed the computer's silicon guts, said he would n't call it intelligent. `` It's just mathematical applications. When humans play chess, they use their intelligence. When machines play chess, they do calculations.'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said the computer was `` fully aggressive'' but that its `` mind was too straight and too primitive.'' `` Chess is much wider than just calculations. It's even wider than logic. You have to use fantasy, intuition and some kind of prediction,'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said. But he said the computer does have some advantages: `` We can lose hope. A computer ca n't lose hope.'' `` One of the main goals of the match is to learn something about Deep Thought,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who wrote the computer program with <PERSON> Feng-Hsiung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he would study the games with <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and possibly rewrite the program to make Deep Thought better. Last November, <PERSON> Deep </PERSON> <PERSON> Thought </PERSON> beat <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s Bent <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> _ the first time a computer had defeated a grandmaster in tournament play. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> is the world's 96th-ranked player, with an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> rating of 2,580 based on his tournament performances. In comparison, the computer's rating from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> is 2,250; the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> put <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> at 2,775. A beginner typically would rank about 1,200. Deep Thought captured the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> became a grandmaster 10 years ago and captured the world championship in 1985. The match at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> was part of an annual chess competition sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> ASG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> was paid an undisclosed amount to participate

 <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> is planning a Spanish-language magazine and a series of daily two-minute television programs designed to reach the fast-growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanic population. The project, which will be launched in the spring of 1990, represents the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based media company's first effort to reach the Hispanic market, which the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> recently said has surpassed 20 million people. It comes as a number of major advertisers including <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have launched ad campaigns to reach Hispanics. According to Hispanic Business Magazine, national advertisers spent more than $ 550 million on reaching this market last year, up 12 percent from 1987. Whittle plans to sell advertising in both the magazine and the TV program in a package and is asking sponsors to make two-year commitments. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, the Whittle executive who has overseen development of the project, said all but `` a couple'' of 20 available advertising units have been sold out for the first two years at an annual price of $ 500,000 per unit. He declined to identify any of the sponsors but said the consumer products giant <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been the leading advertiser to Hispanics, had underwritten development of the project. The magazine and TV programs will be designed to provide useful information on practical concerns such as family health, nutrition, parenting, financial management and education, he said. `` What's out there now is very much entertainment and celebrity-driven editorial,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. The magazine, which will be published once every two months, will be called `` La Familia de Hoy,'' or `` Today's Family.'' It will be distributed at 10,500 locations with large Hispanic clienteles, including doctors' and dentists' offices, hospitals, clinics and beauty salons. Four copies will be left at each site for reading while waiting. In addition, subscriptions will be available at a price to be determined later and tests will be made on newsstand sales and distribution through grocery stores in Hispanic neighborhoods. Each issue is to be 56 pages long with 20 pages of advertising. As with another Whittle magazine project called Special Reports that is distributed in doctors' waiting rooms, advertisers will be guaranteed exclusivity in their product categories. But advertisers in this magazine will get a chance to be on Spanish-language television as well. Whittle plans to produce a series of two-minute informational features that are to air seven days a week on <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest Spanish-language TV network that reaches an estimated 85 percent of the estimated 6 million Hispanic households. It claims a weekly viewing audience of 14 million. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said each of the two-minute features, many of which will be video versions of topics covered in the magazine, would include a 30-second commercial. The features will be run five times a day during the week on the <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> network and three times a day on weekends. Whittle is paying <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> an undisclosed amount for the time, and will provide other considerations, such as promotion in the magazine.

 A 21-member panel of educators has been named to advise on the content of the Channel One daily news show for use in the classroom that debuts next spring, <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday. The Channel One program has provoked considerable controversy since it was tested in six schools last spring because each 12-minute show contains two minutes of paid pitches for products ranging from candy bars to acne medicine. Critics say it is wrong to allow advertisers to peddle their wares to a captive audience of students in school. But the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based Whittle has been recruiting schools for the national rollout of the show next spring, offering to install thousands of dollars worth of TV monitors, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes in exchange for a promise to show the program in class every day. It has touted the program as a way to keep students informed about current events, and has encouraged teachers to develop lesson plans from the new stories that it covers. `` This board will play a critical role in ensuring that the Channel One programming and support materials for the schools meet high and rigorous educational standards,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told striking <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers not to give up and a union van in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, was hit by gunfire over the weekend as the walkout entered its 20th day Monday with no new talks scheduled. The strike by nearly 60,000 Machinists began Oct. 4. A negotiating session called by federal mediator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> ended Wednesday after just four hours. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> was to speak Monday to a group of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> media and business leaders on `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Strike: The Inside Story.'' Under ground rules for the appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION>, the meeting was to be closed and none of the comments published, officials said. To counter the session, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union set their own briefing on the strike. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, was to talk to labor leaders and reporters at the same time as <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>'s speech. In <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, site of a large <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plant, two men and a woman were arrested Saturday after a van outside the union's strike headquarters was sprayed by shotgun pellets. No one was injured and the three were released on bond pending court action. Witnesses said several blasts were fired from a passing car at about 2 a.m. Saturday, striking the van, the building, parked vehicles and a neon sign, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocking </PERSON>, shift strike captain at the Machinists' Aero Lodge 834. The incident occurred as vans were preparing to take pickets to their posts. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told 5,000 Machinists who marched on Saturday: `` When these strikes get long, do n't give up. You must stand together for fairness and dignity.'' The marchers carried plastic bag-covered picket signs, balloons and umbrellas in the rainy weather. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is number one because its workers are number one,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a rally following the march. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the crowd it's time for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to provide its workers with better health care benefits and with child care provisions. `` No new planes can be built without you,'' said <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrow </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` And no new planes will be built without you.'' Machinists voted overwhelmingly to strike rather than take a three-year contract with wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent. The company also offered bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matching inflation; a 20 percent cut in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits. Machinists represent about 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers nationwide, including 43,300 in the Puget Sound area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others at scattered sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other states. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has a total 164,000 workers worldwide and 106,000 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state.
