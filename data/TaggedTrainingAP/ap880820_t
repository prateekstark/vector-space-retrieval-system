 A shark named `` megamouth'' with lips that glow in the dark washed ashore off the coast of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and scientists said it was only the third time such a specimen has been found. `` In this day and age, it is quite a remarkable find,'' Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the Fish Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` Something like this does n't happen every day.'' The fish, which measured 16 feet and looks like a cross between a whale and a shark, swam ashore on Wednesday near the resort town of <LOCATION> Mandurah </LOCATION>. Locals pushed it back to sea, but it beached itself again and died. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said only two other specimens had been found. He said a megamouth _ as researchers call the shark _ was first discovered in 1976 off <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. A second specimen was caught in 1984 off the coast of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It's the first time a megamouth has been found in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the fish lives at depths of 660 feet to 3,300 feet and has bioluminescent lips that glow in the dark to attract jellyfish, plankton, shrimp and other food. `` We do n't know very much about it other than that it swims at great depths apparently with its mouth open, filtering food,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. He said the megamouth has a bulbous head with a mouth measuring 2 -LCB- feet across and tiny teeth. `` It's definitely a shark and it is not prehistoric,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> also noted that the megamouth, weighing about 1,500 pounds, feels very flabby. `` It's sort of like jelly,'' he said. `` That is because it does n't need strong muscles or a hard skeleton for the sort of environment in which it lives.'' He said the museum planned to display the megamouth.

 A man tossed a tear gas canister onto the crowded dance floor of a teen-age nightclub Friday night, causing dozens of injuries and prompting authorities to evacuate the club and a restaurant. A total of 24 people were treated for nausea and skin and eye irritations at area hospitals. Forty-five others were treated at the scene for the same symptoms after the 10:30 p.m. incident, said District Fire Chief <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbetts </PERSON>. Witnesses said a man was seen fleeing the club after throwing the military-type tear gas grenade. Police had no suspects. `` The effects will probably be short-lived and minor on most of them with mainly copious amounts nausea, vomiting and skin irritation,'' said <PERSON> Tibbetts </PERSON>. The incident occurred at The Bar Down Under, which police described as a non-alcoholic club for teen-agers in the basement of Union Station, a popular restaurant and shopping complex in the renovated train station. A total of 200-300 people were evacuated from the club and a restaurant above it, police said. `` All of a sudden the smoke started coming in there and started burning. The people were pushing and pulling everybody, trying to get out,'' an unidentified witness told television station <ORGANIZATION> WRTV </ORGANIZATION>. `` The smoke was so thick it made people sick,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Union Head Hails Court Ruling on Hiring Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The head of a federal employees union says a federal appeals court ruling will force the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to replace a civil service test that was found to discriminate against minorities. The Office of Personnel Management `` can no longer ignore their obligation to develop an alternative system,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> said Friday following the ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The three-judged panel ruled that <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> acted `` arbitrarily and capriciously'' in not providing figures to back its claim that high costs rule out developing a new test for filling entry-level jobs. Because the old test was found to be biased earlier in the long-running court dispute, the agency has been using a non-competitive hiring system based on grades and performance in interviews. <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said the agency would have no comment on the ruling.

 More than 22,000 heavy trucks are being recalled because of potential defects in power steering gears that could result in `` sudden and catastrophic failure,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says. The TRW Ross Gear division, which produced the steering gears, and manufacturers of Peterbilt, <LOCATION> Kenworth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Freightliner </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and White GMC trucks, urged that affected trucks be removed from highways immediately and towed to the nearest truck dealer, the agency said Friday. The recall affects 22,687 trucks carrying certain steering gears manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gear </ORGANIZATION> division since last March. The safety agency said <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed seven incidents of steering gear failure since June. The agency said the suspect equipment includes certain <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gear </ORGANIZATION> division TAS-65 truck steering gears sold for production and a limited number of TAS-65, TAS-40 and TAS-55 gears sold as prototypes.

 Firefighters struggled Friday to encircle a 27,000-acre forest fire that had destroyed 10 houses, forced evacuations and killed cattle in rugged terrain before wind steered flames away from other houses. The leading edge of the 10-day-old Warm Springs Creek fire moved out of the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> toward the small town of <LOCATION> Winston </LOCATION>, about 15 miles southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. But that area of flames did not threaten houses or other building, and no more evacuations were expected, said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> of the Inter-agency Fire Dispatch Center. `` There's no more homes in the way,'' he said Friday. `` But that depends a lot on the weather and the wind's a big factor.'' A weather inversion trapped cooler air, smoke and flames in the lower valleys throughout most of the day and kept the 27,000-acre fire's growth to only 600 acres, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON>, fire information officer. Elsewhere, a helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> crashed Friday, killing one person and injuring three others. Firefighters also battled fires in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The Warm Springs Creek fire grew by 7,000 acres Thursday night, despite the efforts of 1,700 heavily equipped firefighters. But on two fronts, the fire took turns that could help suppress it, said fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON>. He said westerly wind at about 20 mph late Thursday `` pushed the fire back into itself'' on its western border, depriving it of new fuel and lifting a threat to about 500 residents of the <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> subdivision. At the fire's eastern edge Friday, flames moved out of forested high country and onto grassland. `` That's a real benefit to us also,'' <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said, because of the lighter fuel. In addition, its movement took it out of rough, inaccessible terrain into gentler ground where firefighters could work more easily, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelblue </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Barring a return of strong, shifting winds, he said, firefighters should have `` just another day at the office out there.'' Although no new evacuations were expected, <LOCATION> Broadwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Winston-area residents were on the alert. `` Everybody's aware of what's going on,'' he said. `` If it comes down that mountain, they'll have to get out.'' At least three <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> transport planes, modified to drop fire retardant, were brought in from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday and were expected to begin flights Saturday, said <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON>. Erratic wind late Wednesday and and early Thursday had caused the fire to quadruple in size, destroying 10 homes and cabins scattered in the mountains. One cabin owner lost 30 head of cattle. About 40 people remained out of their homes Friday while fire crews backed by bulldozers shored up lines along the north, east and west sides of the fire. <PERSON> Adelblue </PERSON> said the fire was about 30 percent contained. About 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, fire crews were expected to finish mop-up work on a 110-acre grass fire that initially threatened summer homes near <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. In southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, about 1,000 firefighters began disbanding Friday after tightening a noose around three fires that had burned 13,600 acres of scattered timber and grass near Lame Deer. In north-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 980 firefighters attacked the 4,500-acre Lost Canyon fire on the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation. It was about half contained by fire lines, said fire information officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> said the fire moved farther into thick timber and was not threatening any buildings. `` I think we're past that point,'' he said. About 60 smaller lightning-caused fires burned Friday in the <LOCATION> Flathead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> drainage of northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, officials had few details about the helicopter crash in the <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoney </PERSON>, a member of the forest's recreation lands staff. Forest spokesman <PERSON> Harvalou </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said the helicopter was privately owned. The affiliations of the people inside were unknown and their names were being withheld. Wind had pushed the Lost fire in the Bighorn forest past fire lines and it had charred 5,400 acres, approaching within a mile of a ranch and summer homes on its northern edge. A wind shift later, however, helped firefighters, pushing the fire to the west, away from the area. Wind gusting to 30 and 35 mph hampered firefighters in Yellowstone National Park, and park officials closed a road from <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> again Friday because trees that had been left unburned earlier by the Shoshone fire ignited, sending flames into the road. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, wind pushed the North Fork fire to cover about 74,000 acres, a growth of 5,000 acres from reports Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> campgrounds were closed while firefighters worked to protect buildings in <LOCATION> Norris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> from the fire 3 to 4 miles south. In southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, an arson brush fire in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> grew to 1,073 acres Friday, a fire spokesman said. The fire, between <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> and Cabazon peaks and on part of the <LOCATION> Morongo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, was expected to be controlled during the night, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> and Fire. Firefighters in southwest <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> contained an 580-acre brush fire, believed to be man-caused, that burned about 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>. Firefighters also controlled a 600-acre blaze in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Challis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> squelched a nearly 14,000-acre fire and were being sent elsewhere.

 An Iranian official rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that his country was partly responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s downing of an Iranian jetliner, and he said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> was to blame. `` Our civil airliner was using an internationally recognized air corridor, used five times a week by the same captain,'' Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said Friday. During a naval skirmish with Iranian gunboats, the crew of the USS Vincennes misinterpreted radar and electronic signals from the civilian airliner and shot it down July 3, killing all 290 people aboard. Conclusions of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation released Friday blamed human error by the crew, but <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> bore a heavy responsibility for letting the plane fly over a battle. The report said several of the crew's assumptions about the approaching flight were wrong, including that it was descending toward the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and was flying off course. Of the crew's mistaken beliefs, which the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released immediately after the disaster, <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said: `` In the view of the American administration, when such incidents take place at the price of the lives of 290 people, first you can not provide the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people with facts; it is better to forge information, to misinform them than to keep quiet and wait until the facts come out.'' The Iranian envoy laid the blame on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in the gulf. `` One should conclude that the mere presence of such highly dangerous equipment, which can not be controlled even by trained <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel, is the source of tension,'' he said. `` By itself it can cause miseries, one ofter the other.'' He called for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet to pull out of the gulf, saying the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that started today makes it unnecessary. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pay reparations to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the loss of the plane and its passengers and crew and to issue a formal apology. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s regrets and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted responsibility for shooting down the plane. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blames <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for sending the flight over a combat zone and has not apologized. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has approved the payment of damages directly to the families of the victims, but not reparations to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, or any payment that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s government would receive.

 The world's top warblers are puckering up for tunes ranging from <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> to Led Zeppelin at the 11th annual International Whistle-Off this weekend. `` I do n't want to sound boastful, but I think it's a God-given gift,'' said contestant <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ediger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I think maybe the shape of a person's mouth and his teeth have something to do with it she practices two to three hours a day in the months preceding the Whistle-Off. `` I go up to the wee hours of the morning,'' she said. `` It takes a lot of time if you want to be good.'' `` Whistling as an art ranks very high in comparison with other musical arts,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokke </PERSON>. `` These are serious musicians and they're very competitive.'' Thirty people were competing in four divisions today and Sunday in what is billed as the nation's premier whistling event. Whistlers from 15 states, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> compete for a round-trip flight to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The prize will go to the event's grand champion, with trophies going to the top three in each division. Among the whistlers are former three-time grand champion <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, and former two-time grand champion <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Other contestants include <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who will perform Led <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Stairway to Heaven'' in the novelty division, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who will perform an abbreviated version of <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Symphony No 5 in the solo classical division. Time limits are set to `` keep the event moving,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stokke </PERSON> said. Each contestant must whistle three to six minutes for each performance, except in the solo classical division, where four to eight minutes are allowed. Whistlers can compete in as many as three of the four divisions: solo classical, solo popular, novelty and duets. Judges score them from 1 to 5 for artistry, interpretation and performance. `` You never know what to expect at this thing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stokke </PERSON> said. `` Last year, a guy wore a space suit and whistled the theme from `` 2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Past performers also have offered a medley from the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> and the rousing music of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON>. Contestants were to meet in preliminary rounds today, with the top four in each category advancing to Sunday's finals. Those who succeed today ca n't repeat the same tune Sunday. About 5,000 people are expected to attend the Whistle-Off. There's no admission charge. Ms. <PERSON> Stokke </PERSON> said the event has `` really caught on.'' `` We're finding that there are many people interested in whistling and many whistlers who have not had a stage prior to this time.''

<HEAD>Budget Red Ink Surged to $22.9 Billion Last Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal budget deficit climbed by $ 22.9 billion last month after posting a rare surplus in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The new batch of red ink brought the deficit for the first 10 months of the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 to $ 142.0 billion, only slightly less than the amount for the same period last year. Government ledger books were in the black with a $ 9.3 billion surplus for June, mainly as a result of quarterly tax payments by businesses and individuals. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is projecting the deficit for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 at $ 152.3 billion. That is above the administration's $ 146.7 billion deficit estimate in February but below the $ 157 billion forecast by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> at the beginning of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> revised its figures Friday, however, to project a $ 155 billion deficit. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, acting director of the congressional agency, said stronger economic growth than expected for the first half was responsible. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> is not expecting across-the-board spending cuts to be triggered this month by a law calling for a balanced budget by 1993, <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> projections indicate there is no way the budget could be balanced by 1993 in the absence of further policy changes, such as spending cuts or tax increases. The agency, in fact, projects a $ 121 billion deficit in 1993 if present policies are unchanged. Surprising economic growth, which has boosted government revenues and lowered government spending for such programs as unemployment benefits, has been credited with reducing the deficit this year. Many economists believe the deficit will rise again in the fiscal year beginning. Oct. 1. The administration, however, predicts it will drop to $ 140.1 billion in 1989, when figured according to guidelines contained in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Last month's deficit was 2.7 percent higher than the imbalance in July a year ago. Government spending in July actually dropped 6.9 percent when compared to June. Spending fell to $ 83.6 billion but tax receipts dropped even more sharply, falling by 38.8 percent to $ 60.7 billion. Tax receipts for the first 10 months of the fiscal year were up 5.7 percent to $ 741.7 billion while spending is up 4.6 percent to $ 883.7 billion. As usual, the largest spending categories were the military, Social Security and other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and interest on the national debt.

 The third positive development for the space shuttle program in 10 days _ sealing a fuel line leak _ could lead <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to announce a launch date soon for Discovery on the first post-Challenger flight. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has been aiming for a late September or early October liftoff and hopes to be able to establish the date by late next week for the often-delayed mission. Technicians bolted a clamshell-like device over the leak in a Discovery fuel line Friday and filled it with a sealing compound. A subsequent pressure test showed no additional leakage, but officials said they planned to monitor it for a few days. The leak of nitrogen tetroxide was detected July 14. Officials originally thought they would have to move Discovery off the launch pad and back to a hangar for repair, a move that could have delayed the flight by as much as two months. But engineers decided to cut holes in the rear wall of the shuttle's cargo bay to gain access to the leak The holes were cut Wednesday, and the technicians finished the job Friday. The work was delayed until after the launch pad test firing of Discovery's three liquid fuel main engines. That critical test, which certified the engines for flight, was conducted successfully Aug. 10. Another milestone was passed Thursday, when an intentionally flawed solid fuel booster rocket was test-fired for two minutes at the <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Officials said that while initial test results looked excellent, it would be several days before all the data were analyzed. The test-firing was the fifth and final prelaunch test for the redesigned booster, two of which are already attached to Discovery on the launch pad. A faulty joint in one of Challenger's two boosters triggered the explosion that destroyed the shuttle and killed its seven-member crew on Jan. 28, 1986. Meanwhile, engineers here continued to try to learn why a small amount of hydrogen leaked during the main engine test. It was detected in an area where electrical and fuel lines join the shuttle with its external fuel tank. The leak disappeared quickly and was not considered a flight safety hazard, but officials said they would like to understand why it happened. They expect to have test results next week.

<HEAD>North, South Deadlock After Talks and Blame Each Other</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Delegates from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> deadlocked today on peace measures and on sharing the Olympics during a second round of talks, and each side blamed the other for lack of progress. Neither side budged from their positions during today's session at the truce site in the Demilitarized Zone separating the nations. The communist <PERSON> North </PERSON> insisted on being a co-host at the Olympics. The South said it was impossible. They did agree to meet again Monday. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was insincere throughout the meeting,'' the North's chief delegate, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, told a press conference. The chief South Korean delegate, <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Joon-kyu </PERSON>, said any hope of progress depended on the North being more flexible. Park called on the North to give up its demand to be a co-host at the Olympics and simply agree to participate in the Games, which start in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sept. 17. `` I still think the chance of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> participating in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Games is one in a thousand,'' Park told reporters. The twp five-member teams met in the South Korean pavilion. On Friday, they met in the North Korean building. They shook hands and smiled at the start of the talks, but the mood was guarded. The two Koreas, technically still at war, are archenemies with hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150-mile border. The main purpose of the talks was to arrange a full-scale North-South Parliamentary session, but the two sides disagree on what that session should involve. South Korean delegates continued to insist on small delegations for Parliamentary talks instead of participation of the full legislatures of both sides as demanded by the North. The South said the North's plan is unworkable. The South said it would drop its demand for a presidential summit to be discussed. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wants the meeting to urgently address drawing up a non-aggression pact and its demand to be a co-host at the Olympics. The North Korean delegates were drawn from the rubber-stamp <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The South Korean delegation consisted of two government <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and a legislator from each of the three main opposition parties. The North is demanding to be a co-host at the Olympics to stave off a major political defeat. Both sides claim to be the sole legitimate government of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The South sees its selection to hold the Olympics as international recognition of its claim. The International Olympic Committee says <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can not share the Games because they are awarded to a single city. South Korean authorities fear the North may use terrorism to try to disrupt the Olympics. Previous, sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 1970s failed to make progress. The last talks collapsed in January 1986 when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> pulled out to protest annual South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was divided in 1945 by Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being signed. The South has evolved into a major economic power and started to move toward full democracy, while the North has remained one of the most isolated nations in the world.

<HEAD>City Should Benefit From GOP Convention For 20 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, looking to burnish its image, should reap benefits for many years from the exposure its prize city received while hosting the Republican National Convention, some of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' major boosters say. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has never looked better; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has never looked brighter,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, head of the Fortune 500 company <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> and a key convention fund-raiser. The city rolled out its plushest red carpet for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> visitors, with sumptuous parties, tasty native cuisine, riverboat rides and Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> reminding everyone <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was polishing a tarnished image. `` Sooner or later, the message was going to come across that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is not strictly a party town or a place for good food and music,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are starting to do the right things to make this a viable economic center.'' `` It will probably have gains for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> for the next 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trail </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> businessman and another key fund-raiser. Complaints were few during the four-day convention that ended Thursday. But then, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> handles <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> every year with 20 times as many visitors and a different kind of crowd, police said. `` At <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> Gras ... it's a party crowd and there are a few more untoward incidents,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` It was very good as far as we're concerned.'' Suffocating humidity and 90-degree temperatures also made it too hot to misbehave, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The subtropical weather and the sound system at the giant <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superdome </ORGANIZATION> drew most of the complaints. Technicians began adjusting the system after Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s 1964 presidential nominee, said he could n't hear a word of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell speech Monday The complaints diminished during the week, but they did n't go away. `` It is not the Superdome system,'' said dome manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, explaining that the Republicans installed their own. Some of the more conservative delegates were not charmed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' tolerance for the weird, the drunken and the sexy. `` Now that we have visited Sodom, where is Gomorrah?'' one <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state delegate was reported asking. But others were seduced by the city's history, its laid-back attitudes and the mighty <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Our goal was to put together one of the most successful conventions in history,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said he was hard pressed to find anyone who was n't enamored of the French Quarter, the streetcars and the oak-lined avenues. `` I do n't believe that we could have spent $ 1 billion in advertising and reaped the benefits equal to the fantastic free press, the free media, we are receiving,'' <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said. `` Fortunately, we've been given the opportunity to redeem ourselves after the world's fair fiasco.'' The 1984 World Exposition here was a delight for those who attended but a financial disaster because so many people stayed away. The state's image also has suffered because of the slump in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s energy-based economy and its history of shady politics. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s jobless rate has been No. 1 or No. 2 in the country the last three years. The state's storied corruption spans from the legendary <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> _ whose life was chronicled in fictionalized form in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel `` All the King's Men'' _ to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who spent much of his third term successfully defending himself against federal racketeering charges. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the city already is looking forward to hosting the Republicans, the Democrats or both four years from now. `` It's very seldom both parties have their convention in the same city,'' he noted. It happened in 1952 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and 1972 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> hopes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> will claim that fame at the next 20-year interval, 1992. `` We're hoping history repeats itself,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mulroney Government Hit By Kickback Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two legislators from Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Conservative government say kickbacks are a way of life in the administration _ charges that could hurt <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in elections expected next month. The allegations, which surfaced Thursday and Friday, are political fodder for opposition parties. Polls show the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with a narrow overall lead, followed by the Conservatives and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The government said the accusations, by a disgruntled former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member and another Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, were unsubstantiated. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Blais-Grenier </PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosemount </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> as saying that companies routinely pay kickbacks to get federal contracts in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. Another Conservative member from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Noce </PERSON>, was quoted in the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citizen </LOCATION> as saying the most difficult part of his job was to `` stay clean.'' Ms. <PERSON> Blais-Grenier </PERSON>, who resigned as junior transport minister in 1985 in a dispute over aid to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> oil refineries, said she lacked the detailed proof for police charges. But she called for an impartial commission to investigate federal contracts. Ms. <PERSON> Blais-Grenier </PERSON> is under pressure from party leaders in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> not to seek re-election. Other Conservative legislators from the province met Friday to consider expelling her from the caucus. <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Noce </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` I could put a dozen people in prison.'' But on Friday, <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Noce </PERSON> said he had no proof and said he had not expressed himself clearly in the original interview. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was absent from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> when opposition leaders hammered the government about the alleged patronage. He is expected to call an election next month, a year before his five-year term expires, because of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold up ratification of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which is to take effect on Jan. 1. Liberal <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Garneau </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> legislator, said: `` I've never seen such serious admissions on the part of a government.'' But Solicitor General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> said: `` We as a government have no information whatsoever to substantiate the allegations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> interviewed Ms. <PERSON> Blais-Grenier </PERSON> on Friday, and Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said she `` had no details of any activity which could permit the <ORGANIZATION> RCMP </ORGANIZATION> to initiate a criminal investigation.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Mounties </ORGANIZATION> had not yet spoken with <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Noce </PERSON>. Police confirmed they have asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to interview officials at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in connection with a 2-year-old investigation of possible kickbacks in a $ 820,000 Canadian government contract to lease office space from the company. Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, poised to take over as prime minister if his party wins the election, told the Commons that a royal commission should `` investigate the whole course of conduct of this government.'' But Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazankowski </PERSON> dismissed the suggestion and said the government had moved quickly in the past by ousting ministers and ordering inquiries when there was `` clear evidence of wrongdoing.''

<HEAD>Plaintiff: Discrimination Exists Systemwide In FBI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lead plaintiff in a class-action suit against the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says bias is so institutionally ingrained at the agency that even he treated fellow Hispanics unfairly. `` Bigotry is not the problem,'' <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> testified Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we're talking about is a system of discrimination. As a supervisor, I've been part of that system. I'm not talking about a particular person. I'm talking about an organization.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and the 310 Hispanic agents who joined him in the lawsuit contend the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against Hispanics in hiring, promotion, assignments and discipline. They are seeking damages and changes in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> policy. About 400 of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 9,000 agents are Hispanic. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Personnel Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rarity </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified earlier that the agency does not discriminate against Hispanics. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who filed the suit in January 1987, was one of the last witnesses to testify for the plaintiffs in what is scheduled to be a two-week, non-jury trial. The plaintiffs rested Friday after five days of testimony and about 40 witnesses; the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to start calling witnesses for its defense Monday. During the first week of the trial, agents testified that Hispanics are assigned a disproportionate number of Spanish-language wiretaps and temporary out-of-town assignments. Because those assignments are not considered as prestigious or difficult as street investigations, Hispanics are given lower performance appraisals than non-Hispanics, agents testified. Other agents testified that Hispanics are more likely to be given dangerous undercover assignments, but that they do n't receive the same recognition for that work as non-Hispanics. Hispanics are assumed to know Spanish even when they do n't, and non-Hispanic Spanish-speakers are much less likely than Hispanics to be assigned low-glamor or highly dangerous jobs, according to testimony. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he had no choice but to engage in such discriminatory actions because the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is structured that way and because the agency has not tried hard enough to hire bilingual agents or teach agents Spanish. Every Hispanic agent who testified expressed fear of retaliation for cooperating with the lawsuit. During three hours of testimony Friday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> described what he called a systematic pattern of discrimination against him. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, second-in-command at the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> bureau, said he first noticed discrimination when he was attending the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> academy at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` One time the assistant director called me into his office and said, ` What would you say if I called you a blankety-blank blank blank Mexican?' I said, ` I would say you're an ignorant person.' `` He said he wanted to know because they would be handing me a weapon and he did n't want me flying off the handle and hurting people.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> testified his problems intensified in 1982, after he was demoted from the top post in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and sent to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he was the No. 2 man under agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretzing </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bretzing </PERSON> kept <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> uninformed about investigations and repeatedly harassed him, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bretzing </PERSON> demoted <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> twice, before finally forcing him to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` Butte and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> are considered dumping grounds for agents who are malcontents,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> testified.

<TEXT>
 Firefighters braced for 40 mph winds today as they battled an 11-day-old, 27,000-acre wildfire south of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> that consumed at least 10 homes and 30 head of cattle. Meanwhile, dozens of other fires _ some of them potentially serious _ broke out in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, state and federal officials said. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, firefighters at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> also were expected to encounter high winds, and a team began investigating a helicopter crash that killed one person in <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> during firefighting efforts. Wildfires continued to rage in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The devastating fire near <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> cooled somewhat Friday after dramatic runs earlier in the week. The fire turned just before reaching a mountain subdivision with scores of residences and surrounding ranches. `` We're looking pretty good,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON>, a fire information officer. She said the fire had grown by 600 acres Friday, but that was a small increase compared with the 7,000 - and 15,000-acre runs the two previous nights With a part of the fire heading southeast toward flatter land, officials said they would have more of a chance of checking its advance once it left the rugged mountain ridges. Another portion of the fire was moving into even rougher country to the south, but there was no danger of damage to structures there. `` There's no more homes in the way,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> of the Inter-agency Fire Dispatch Center. `` But that depends a lot on the weather, and the wind is a big factor.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast winds gusting to 40 mph today. Fires were burning over thousands of acres elsewhere in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, many of the blazes resulting from lightning strikes earlier in the week. At least one summer residence was destroyed and others threatened in a small but dangerous blaze that erupted in logging slash Friday afternoon about 12 miles northwest of Butte, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Deerlodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Other fires were reported in southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, including one that threatened to overrun a ranch in southern <LOCATION> Bighorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> line. Some of the 1,000 firefighters on three fires that have burned 14,000 acres of scattered timber and grasslands near Lame Deer in southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were released from lines Friday, and officials said those blazes should be controlled by Sunday evening. In north-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 980 firefighters put finishing touches on a 4,500-acre fire on the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation. Spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstrock </PERSON> said the fire should be fully encircled by tonight if the weather cooperates. About 40 smaller lightning-caused fires burned Friday in the <LOCATION> Flathead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> drainage of northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said firefighters began removing debris and flammable materials from the structures in the <LOCATION> Norris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> area to prepare for the arrival of a 74,000-acre fire. `` If the forecast brings winds as anticipated, we expect -LRB- the fire -RRB- will reach <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> -LRB- today -RRB-,'' she said. The blaze is one of several burning in the nation's oldest national park. In <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, investigators representing the agencies fighting a 5,400-acre blaze on Friday reached the site of the fatal helicopter crash, which left its three other occupants injured. The privately owned helicopter, under contract with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, crashed in a rugged wilderness area west of the fire's western boundary. A wildfire set by an arsonist in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> charred 1,237 acres but firefighters encircled it, while a blaze burning out of control blackened at least 300 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The arson fire, on part of the <LOCATION> Morongo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> about 95 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was contained Friday night and full control was expected by early today, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> said.

 What began as a hometown salute to Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and the Republican ticket turned into mass catcalls and jeers as thousands of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> supporters reacted angrily to reporters' questions about whether he had strings pulled to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. As the audience chanted `` Quayle! Quayle!'' the 41-year-old senator said there was nothing improper in the way he entered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. The Republican vice presidential nominee acknowledged that a family friend made calls on his behalf after he expressed interest in joining the Guard but insisted: `` I got in fairly.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he resented implied slurs on his patriotism by media reports of the controversy and said it should help, not hurt, him with the voters. `` You're going to be surprised at how outraged people and families that identify with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are going to be towards these accusations,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said as the crowd cheered. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials denied that the event had been orchestrated to include the crowd in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first detailed answers to questions about his military record. But the event provided another example of how Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate has seemed to overshadow the campaign. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday editions that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> passed an armed forces physical examination on April 9, 1969, which meant that he would have been eligible to be drafted at any time after his May 25 graduation day. He was called to take the physical by his local draft board while he was still a <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> senior, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. He entered the National Guard on May 19, but the newspaper quoted Guard officials as saying they were still reviewing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military records, presumably showing when he applied to join, and could not release them The senator had promised to respond Friday to questions that have dogged him since he was picked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his running mate. But the opportunity provided by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides came at the end of a rousing rally for the popular senator at a courthouse square across from his father's newspaper. After <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shook hands with his supporters, aides brought him before a throng of reporters at an outdoor news conference, which was piped over an public address system. Boos and hoots of `` b-o-r-i-n-g'' sang out across the courtyard as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked about the sequence of events that led to his entry into the Guard. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that during his senior year in college, as he pondered future military service, he turned to his parents for advice `` like any 22 year old.'' He faced the loss of his college deferment after graduation. The family discussed the matter with <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, a former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> who worked for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s grandfather at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, in an account that was similar to that <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> has provided to reporters. `` I did not ask him to make any calls. I told him I was interested in getting into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. ... I would assume that calls would be made,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, who has said he contacted the Guard on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf, `` knew that I wanted to get into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and I hoped he would help me,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said `` I did not join to avoid service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because by joining the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, I could have gone to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> if my unit had been called up,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The senator said he would not have done things differently if he had known he would be running for vice president. He said he did not consider the matter an embarrassment for the ticket and had not offered to remove himself from the race. `` Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agrees with me that it is patriotic to serve in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and he's proud of my service,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. At the rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` a young man of vision, of character.'' But it was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for whom the crowd reserved its greatest enthusiasm. Scores of residents dotted the road to <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> airport, and <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s police chief estimated the crowd at the rally to be as many as 20,000 people. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told them: `` We have the values, the character, the work ethic of all small towns.'' `` My roots, my values, my friends, my neighborhoods _ it is indeed a proud day, but most importantly, I am just proud of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>,'' he said. The crowd roared when he added: `` We love the National Guard.''

 Scientists in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> say a new material shows possible superconductivity at up to 66 degrees above the current record temperature, but other scientists have reacted with caution. The new report does not include a crucial test for proving superconductivity, so the material should be considered only a possible superconductor, the other experts said. Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct electricity without loss to resistance. If the materials can be made practical, they may lead to such advances as smaller, more powerful computers and magnetically levitated high-speed trains. Materials created so far must be chilled before they will superconduct. Researchers are trying to develop materials with as high a superconducting temperature as possible, to minimize the expense of cooling and so make superconductors more practical. The new report from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> says five samples of the material showed no electrical resistance at temperatures above minus 208 degrees Fahrenheit. One sample showed no resistance at minus 168 degrees, the researchers said. The current widely accepted record is minus 234 degrees. The new research is disclosed in `` High Tc Update,'' a newsletter published by the <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. `` Tc'' refers to the temperature at which a material begins to superconduct. The newsletter obtained a copy of a paper by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> Hsinchu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The researchers reported their material includes the same ingredients as the current record-holding compound: thallium, calcium, barium, copper and oxygen. Some samples that conducted electricity without resistance at temperatures above minus 208 degrees eventually lost that ability. Others that could do so above minus 226 degrees still had that ability after a week, the researchers said. The reason for the changes in performance in some samples has not yet been pinpointed, they said. Superconductivity researcher <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> said he found no errors in the reported resistance measurements when he visited the researchers recently in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. But he also said he knew of no measurements of the magnetic characteristics of the new material. Superconducting materials give off a characteristic magnetic signal when exposed to a magnetic field, and existence of this signal is considered a crucial test of whether a material is a true superconductor. Without a report of that measurement, the material should be considered only a possible superconductor, he said. Similarly, physicist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> at the Ames laboratory said the manuscript from the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> researchers is `` very convincing,'' but that the lack of magnetic measurements is disturbing. <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> said he ` would n't get excited'' about the new material until such measurements are reported and the experimental results are duplicated by other researchers.

 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> merchant vessels sailed the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> for the first time in eight years today under protection of a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahim </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zalah </LOCATION>, a government-owned 35,338-ton oil tanker, took on cargo and left <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to sail the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> `` a few hours after the truce began'' at 7 a.m. -LRB- 11 p.m. EDT -RRB-. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> often attacked shipping during the war, leaving hundreds of vessels damaged or destroyed in the gulf. Iraqi shipping through the gulf stopped shortly after the outbreak of the war in September 1980. It relied on pipelines for the export of its oil and on shipments via <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for its commercial trade. In his statement, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, the oil minister did not say where the vessel was loaded or from where it sailed. `` Some people were betting that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would not be able to renew its oil exports through the gulf for months or years after the halt of the war,'' he said. `` But here we are, and within a few hours, already launching our first shuttle.'' He did not disclose the destination of <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zalah </ORGANIZATION> nor mention another ship, the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, which shipping executives said sailed earlier today from a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> toward the gulf. The <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON> honked its horns as it began its northbound voyage from the port of Fujairah toward the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> almost immediately after the truce began, shipping executives said. One of the shipping executives monitoring spillovers of the war on gulf shipping said: `` There has been nothing special, everything is quiet. ... let's see if it lasts.'' The London-based <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> says 546 commercial vessels have been damaged in the so-called `` tanker war.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacked Iranian-chartered ships and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliated by attacking neutral shipping since <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> was shut down during the war. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s authoritative register of vessels lists the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON> as a 3,985-ton cargo vessel that could also be used as a tank-landing troop ship.'' The <PERSON> Idrissi </PERSON> is not listed. The <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, which the executives said has an Iraqi captain and a 21-man crew on board, would first sail through a 100-mile stretch from the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The vessel would then sail up the gulf to the southern <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, 600 miles from <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> chief, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will continue to search vessels in the gulf until `` the establishment of comprehensive peace'' between the two countries. Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegations are scheduled to begin negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next week. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has intercepted hundreds of commercial vessels in the past years, searching for Iraq-bound war-related cargo.

 A cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> took hold this morning after hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers moved into position along the war front to monitor the first truce in eight years of war. Peace officially began at 7 a.m. -LRB- 11 p.m. EDT -RRB-. Official media in the two countries carried no reports of any violations or other incidents along their common 730-mile border. For the first time in eight, years <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> resumed shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Iraqis marched in the streets of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and in towns throughout their country late Friday, celebrating what <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s media called that nation's `` victory'' in the conflict. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, acting Commander-in-Chief <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> warned that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> might not want peace and that if it renewed hostilities, it would face a much stronger <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it was reopening the international airport in the war-battered southern city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and announced that merchant ships will soon sail into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for the first time since the early months of the Iran-Iraq war. As night fell Friday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and public parks of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, many waving portraits of President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and chanting slogans in praise of peace. `` It is the happiest day in my life,'' said <PERSON> Alaa </PERSON>, an 18-year-old on <LOCATION> Karada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a main artery in downtown <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. He said he was due to be conscripted to the front in January. About 150 unarmed Blue Berets from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> were deployed along the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> side of the border to monitor the truce, worked out during talks between <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leaders. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said 200 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers would monitor the truce from the Iranian side. The officers were drawn from 24 countries. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has set a $ 75.6 million budget for the mission. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker and a powerful protege of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, said in a Friday prayer sermon: `` We are facing two paths, war and peace. We chose peace, but we are not sure about <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. If the enemy wants to continue the war, it will continue much more seriously.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also noted that `` Iranian forces have become much stronger and more experienced. This war was a great help to the export of our revolution and all the world realized that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> resisted without any help.'' The Iraqi general command, in a statement carried by Iraqi radio and television, also said <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s forces would abide by the cease-fire `` conscientiously and responsibly.'' It expressed hope for better relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but added: `` Our bitter experience, and the sea of blood that the Iranian aggression caused, make it our responsibility not to deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the basis of wishful thinking but on the basis of reality so that we are not cheated again.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahim </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ain </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalah </PERSON>, a government-owned 35,338-ton oil tanker, loaded up and sailed down the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> `` a few hours after the truce began.'' Another Iraqi ship, the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of Fujairah in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and headed north for the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> almost immediately after the truce began, said shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> often attacked shipping during the war, leaving hundreds of vessels damaged or destroyed in the gulf. Direct peace talks between the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> open Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, mediated by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks will focus on the peace plan decribed in Security Council Resolution 598. The resolution calls for the cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to their own territory, exchange of prisoners of war, direct peace talks, and establishment of an impartial commmission to establish responsibility for the outbreak of the conflict. The resolution was passed in July 1987 and accepted by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> at that time. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> finally accepted in last month, clearing the way for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks that led to the truce. Most Western estimates of the number of people killed since the conflict broke out in September 1980 range from a half million to 1 million, with some figures even higher. The countries participating in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Major Layoff Coming at Continental Airlines, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, plagued by losses in recent months, is planning a layoff of up to 1,000 pilots, flight attendants and other employees, its chairman says. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorzenzo </PERSON> disclosed the plan here Friday outside a court hearing at which he defended plans for a major layoff at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s sister <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, also chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, said a formal announcement of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> layoff would come in the next few days along with the carrier's new fall schedule. He told reporters the layoff would involve 2 percent to 6 percent of the company's 36,000 employees and include flight attendants as well as some management personnel. Between 300 and 500 pilots would be involved, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> posted a net loss of $ 231 million in the first six months of this year and announced earlier that there would be service cutbacks. At the hearing, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said its was necessary to lay off some 4,000 employees and cut back service at Miami-based Eastern. The cuts, which would curtail service to 14 cities, were announced earlier but have been blocked thus far under terms of a temporary restraining order issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> at the request of three unions that represent <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the cuts were needed to save the financially troubled line. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management is not permitted to take the actions to save this company, then <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> may run out of cash,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. He denied suggestions by attorneys for the employees that he has been attempting to engage in so-called union busting by transferring <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. He also said there was no plan to merge the lines. The cutbacks represent an effort `` to stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. Union attorneys did question <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> about the draft of a speech that he was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought Eastern. It said the purchase gave <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> leverage over the union. `` Eastern's airplanes can be repainted and moved over to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> where they will be flown by non-union pilots,'' it said. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said an investment banking firm prepared the speech. It was unclear whether he ever delivered it.

 It took dozens of investigators and an elaborate police scheme, but authorities say they finally caught a man who cheated manufacturers in at least eight states out of millions of dollars for years. `` He was terribly, terribly intelligent,'' police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said of 35-year-old <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Offen </PERSON>, who was nabbed Friday as he tried to complete yet another alleged swindle. Through fancy phone work, <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> was able to steal and move on without getting caught, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> would arrange for products such as light bulbs, luggage, sunglasses and packaging tape to be trucked to warehouses that he would rent for a few days, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Before the end of the 30-day period for paying for the merchandise, <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> would resell it, then disappear with the money. `` He was virtually a phantom, a voice on the end of a line,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The scam ended when detectives moved in on him at 4:30 p.m. at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> phone booth, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` He was terribly surprised because he's very disciplined and very intelligent and thought he was above arrest,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s special fraud squad. <PERSON> Offen </PERSON>, who used as many as 50 aliases and a variety of voices, was charged with grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, criminal impersonation and warrant for interstate flight to avoid prosecution, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> is wanted by <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, police in connection with numerous fraud cases that authorities estimate amounted to $ 15 million in losses for companies there, said Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. Other states where police say his schemes reached include <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. By late Friday, police had not located any of the money and did not know where <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> lived or what he did with the money, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Offen </PERSON>, who was last arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state on larceny charges in 1977, refused to speak to police and asked for an attorney, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. To earn the trust of manufacturers, <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> would learn the names of key people such as warehouse managers and would haggle during the purchases like a legitimate buyer, he said. <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> would use legitimate trucking companies and other unknowing go-betweens, but would only pay for the relatively inexpensive rental of the warehouses, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Rarely would <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> meet anyone himself. Although it was not known how many years <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> had been operating, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued an advisory about him in September 1986, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The case broke on May 11, when police Detective <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> began investigating the theft of about $ 30,000 worth of light bulbs from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> later arranged for a shipment of $ 100,000 in light bulbs but avoided a police trap in both instances by not showing up to collect the merchandise and not sending anyone else to collect, he said. `` If he felt something was wrong he would burn the operation,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. On Aug. 12, a cooperating witness for police was contacted by <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> and asked to warehouse $ 60,000 worth of light bulbs. The witness called police, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the theft of light bulbs from a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, company that were destined for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said agent <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. After learning that an additional shipment was destined for <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, police and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arranged the help of truckers, manufacturers, a store owner and others in duping <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> into thinking the shipment was on its way, he said. Still, <PERSON> Offen </PERSON> suspected something was wrong and even hired a private investigator to find out about the light bulb delivery, police said. On Friday, he continued to try to verify by phone whether the light bulbs had actually arrived, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Police traced the calls and arrested him, he said. `` He looks like a salesman,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` He could be a light bulb salesman.''

 A 2-year-old boy died after relatives accidentally left him in a car and searing afternoon sun raised the temperature inside the vehicle to about 200 degrees, police said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Krick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> was strapped into his child restraint seat and was in the closed car for about two hours before he was discovered Friday afternoon, police said. The boy probably died within a half-hour of heat prostration or heat stroke, investigators said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the boy and his 5-year-old sister were returning from an outing with their grandmother, 55-year-old <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, and their uncle, 33-year-old <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Krick </PERSON>, when the child was left in the car. Police said the child was asleep and apparently was overlooked when the uncle and <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, carrying <PERSON> James </PERSON>' sleeping sister, went inside Ms. <PERSON> May </PERSON>'s home after parking in the driveway about 3 p.m.. Ms. May assumed <PERSON> Krick </PERSON>, her son, would bring the boy inside, and <PERSON> Krick </PERSON> thought his mother would do so, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Feeling ill, the grandmother decided to nap, and <PERSON> Krick </PERSON> left the house in another car for an appointment, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. When Ms. May woke about two hours later, she realized <PERSON> James </PERSON> was missing. `` The windows are tinted so even the neighbors would n't have seen the child in there,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It is a very tragic situation.'' Paramedics who tried unsuccessfully to revive the boy took his temperature, but it was too high to measure with the thermometer, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Corich </PERSON>.

 A hidden in a parked car blew up near a busload of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers, killing seven men, injuring 28 and blasting a crater six feet deep in the highway, police said today. Victims were hurled into nearby fields, and their personal belongings and debris from the bus were scattered along the remote country road after the blast late Friday, officials said. No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion inevitably fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to end British rule in the province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for two other bombings Friday. The army threw a security ring around the blast site today and helicopters circled overhead as forensic scientists and anti-terrorist officers combed the debris for clues. The bus carried no military markings, and investigators were trying to determine how the attackers knew that it would be in the area at that time. It was the worst attack against <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since 1982, when 11 soldiers died in the bombing of a pub in <LOCATION> Ballykelly </LOCATION>. Police Superintendent <PERSON> Wynnefield </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooke </PERSON>, leading the hunt for the killers, said the bomb was in a vehicle parked on the side of the road. Initial reports said the blast was caused by a land mine. <PERSON> Hooke </PERSON> said one of the injured was on a life support machine and a number of others were very seriously injured. The injured were suffering from burns, fractures, internal injuries and severe lacerations, he said. The bus was carrying infantrymen returning from leave in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to their barracks at <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s middle-of-the-road <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who lives near the scene of the blast, described the attack as `` a terrible slaughter.'' `` The bus was a mess of mangled metal,'' said <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON>, who went to the scene with other local people. `` It was a miracle anyone got out of it alive. Mutilated bodies were stewn over a radius of 50 to 100 yards. I saw seven bodies. The faces of the injured were terribly cut and bleeding.'' His son <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, drove three injured men to <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` The whole side of the bus was blown out by the bomb,'' <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> said. `` Most of the boys were still in their seats when we got there. Some had been blown out the side and others out of the back.'' <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police said 35 soldiers were on the bus. Initial reports said there were 38 and the British domestic news agency later Friday put the number at 39. A press officer at Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was `` deeply shocked and distressed.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister responsible for the province, broke off his vacation in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to fly back to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> for an emergency meeting with army and police chiefs. Friday's blast occurred nine miles from <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>. The soldiers earlier Friday had flown back to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> from leave, landing at the military section of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Aldergrove </LOCATION> airport. Two other bombs exploded early Friday. One injured three police officers in <LOCATION> Lisnaskea </LOCATION> and the other damaged the Mourne Country Hotel in <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s newest luxury hotel. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> message to a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> radio station said the hotel, near the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, is `` a meeting place for members of the security forces and informers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for that bombing and the one in <LOCATION> Lisnaskea </LOCATION>, 62 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Also on Friday, funerals were held for a British soldier whom <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed last week in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and for a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> grocer shot to death Wednesday in his <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> store. In <LOCATION> Knighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 mourners attended the funeral of Warrant Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heakin </PERSON>, 38, who was killed by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen Aug. 12 in the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION> as he stopped his car for a traffic light. He was stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but his license plate identified him as a British soldier. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, thousands of people lined the streets to observe a funeral procession for <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Otley </PERSON>, 44, a grocer fatally shot by masked gunmen Wednesday in his shop in the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Shankill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> area of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> _ a previously unknown group _ and the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the grocer's slaying.

 Tens of thousands of mourners gathered at the huge Faisal Mosque today in a funeral procession for President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. Some clutched portraits of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and shouted, `` We will mourn you forever!'' The funeral cortege made its way slowly to the mosque as the crowds, composed mostly of men, chanted from the Koran, holy book of the Islamic faith, and shouted praises of their leader who died in a plane crash Wednesday. The lawns and terraces surrounding the mosque were jammed and scores of men clambered up on the roof and clung precariously to the soaring dome. The flag-covered, flower-draped coffin was transferred from a military ambulance to a gun carriage pulled by soldiers about 500 yards from the mosque. `` My heart is crying for him, and I am praying for his salvation,'' said 74-year-old <PERSON> Mian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihtishamuddin </PERSON>, who came by bus from <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, 100 miles away. Soldiers with bayonets and riot police with bamboo sticks lined the streets leading to the modern mosque, the world's largest. The crowd was generally orderly. The funeral procession was broadcast live by state-run television. The cameras focused briefly on the tear-stained faces of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Shafiq </PERSON>, and a son, <PERSON> Ijaz </PERSON>. Investigators were still searching for the cause of the crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, and 28 other people. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> landed Friday night with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, designated to replace <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>. `` This journey is a journey in sorrow,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` I will be expressing the heartfelt sorrow of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s tragic loss.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was one of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s staunchest backers. Thousands of people poured into <LOCATION> Faisal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> for prayers Friday, the Islamic holy day, and heard eulogies for their late leader. A sermon extolled <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> as the `` shaheed,'' or martyr, of the Moslems. `` It's difficult to imagine <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> without <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>,'' said a bearded army captain watching the crowd. Across the border in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the government of <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, an Indian state also claimed by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, passed a resolution expressing its `` profound grief and anguish'' over the death of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. The state government also lifted a curfew in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, the summer capital, for three hours. Security officials said the city of 700,000 was calm. Four people were killed in the state Thursday in riots stemming from <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death. In the absence of any government statement on Wednesday's in-flight explosion, Pakistani newspapers were rife with speculation Their unattributed and undocumented theories ranged from deliberate sabotage by unspecified enemies to a bomb hidden in a basket of mangoes. A Pakistani government information officer discounted all the press accounts. `` Nothing is known yet,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The investigators are still at the scene.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> Ijaz </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, said he believed the plane was sabotaged, and he told <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that `` naturally'' he suspected the Soviets. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency today reported on the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> media reports of sabotage, but it did not mention <PERSON> Ijaz </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>'s comments. Like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> supports rebels fighting the Soviet-backed government in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had often accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating a U.N.-mediated agreement providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Acting President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> has said he would not rule out sabotage in <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death but would await a report from the military investigators. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a team of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> was assisting in the investigation at the crash site near <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION>, 330 miles south of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Two Urdu-language newspapers said police had detained people for questioning about the crash, but a senior official police who spoke on condition of anonymity said the detentions were unrelated to the crash. The mass circulation <PERSON> Jang </PERSON> newspaper said those detained were employees of <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Markaz </PERSON>, a smaller newspaper, said 16 people were detained near <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION> but did not say whether they worked at the airport. Nawa-i-waqt, an authoritative <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION> daily, said investigators had recovered the plane's flight recorder. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, who succeeded <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ,64, by virtue of his post as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said he would carry out <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s pledge to conduct nationwide parliamentary elections Nov. 16 But like <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, he has not said whether the presidency also will be at stake in the voting.

<HEAD>Eight Insolvent S&amp;Ls Merged As Southwest Plan Continues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In the wake of the merger of eight insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans into one government-owned unit, analysts questioned whether the consolidation will lead to a long-term resolution of the state's banking troubles. `` The question is: What have they accomplished by this?'' asked <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, Va.-based consultant on thrift institutions. `` I characterize this as throwing toether a bunch of minnows and sharks and getting one bloated whale,'' he said of the consolidation, announced Friday by federal regulators. Similarly, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he was concerned such long-term commitments from the government might mean taxpayers eventually will have to bail out the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Resolving hopelessly insolvent thrifts like these once and for all takes real money, no funny money notes and asset guarantees,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. He called the deal a `` temporary Band-Aid'' that only serves as a delay to a taxpayer bailout. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> estimated Friday it will spend at least $ 5.5 billion over the next decade to create the new institution and combine the thrifts, which include three of the largest institutions in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The merger, announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, is the biggest under the government's <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, which was developed to consolidate or close 120 ailing savings and loan associations of the 279 operating in the state as of Jan. 1 The thrifts involved include Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, whose first-quarter loss of $ 1.2 billion ranked it No. 1 for quarterly losses among the nation's savings and loans this year. Also part of the consolidation are <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, which ranked 12th in losses for the first quarter, and <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION>, ranked 20th in first-quarter losses. The other institutions are: <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan of <LOCATION> Brady </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Multibanc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alice </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Texana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` The eight thrifts have the most complex and troubled assets portfolios in the state,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F.S.B. </ORGANIZATION>, as the consolidated institution will be called, will be headed by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wageman </PERSON>, now director of <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Each of the eight merged thrifts will be operated as branches and depositors will be covered, bank board officials said. In the early 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> thrived on real estate lending, and according to federal regulators, loose lending practices. Sunbelt and the seven other institutions had interlocking loans and investments, often lending money for the same projects. But as the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> property boom went bust in 1985, primarily because of an overbuilt market, the fortunes of the eight institutions slid. Friday's announcement was the second in as many days of federally sponsored consolidations of troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts as part of the government plan to rid the state of mismanaged and poorly operating savings and loans. Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> announced the consolidation of 12 troubled thrifts. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a settlement was reached that would return $ 100 million to depositors in five failed thrifts. The agreement, announced Friday night by Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, would pay $ 100 million of the $ 106 million that was on deposit when the savings and loans collapsed in 1986. It also contained a provision to repay the remaining $ 6 million if and when the money is collected. The five failed thrifts covered by the agreement, which is subject to legislative approval, were <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Interlake </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>, and Charter Thrift and Loan.

 Workers at four more coal mines today went on strike and joined thousands of other miners, dockworkers and transit workers in demanding legalization of the Solidarity trade union federation. At least 10 mines were crippled, and the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> was without dockworkers or public transportation in what appeared to be the nation's worst labor unrest since 1981. Unlike the nationwide strikes of 1981, however, the current unrest was limited to two geographical areas. `` We will not back down from our demands that Solidarity be legalized,'' said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Milczanowski </PERSON>, a strike leader at the <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> docks where about 2,000 workers held an occupation strike. `` The authorities must realize that if they want improvement, they must restore Solidarity,'' he said. Reporters witnessed new strikes at the 3,000-worker <PERSON> Krupinski </PERSON> mine in <LOCATION> Suszec </LOCATION> and the 3,500-worker ZMP mine in <LOCATION> Zory </LOCATION>. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said strikes also were under way at the First of May and <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mines. All the struck mines are in the southwestern region of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertig </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, said two other mines were on strike in the region: <LOCATION> Brzeszcze </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jaworzno </PERSON>. Mine officials reached by telephone denied the report. Since the strikes began Tuesday, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has lost 110,000 tons of coal production worth $ 5.5 million, <PERSON> Antoni </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilny </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> area mining authority said Friday. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> put the strikes' cost at $ 222,000 a day. The Council of Ministers accused strike organizers of trying to `` take advantage of the material difficulties and hardships of everyday life. `` Instigators and organizers of the illegal strikes, in which as a rule only part of the crew takes part, not infrequently place at the top of the demands the issue of reactivating the former ` Solidarity.' It is an unrealizable demand,'' the council said. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> warned that workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> would join the labor unrest unless the government legalizes Solidarity. The stikers are also demanding more pay and better working conditions. The government says the strikes disrupt safety maintenance at the mines, allowing potentially explosive methane gas to build up. `` We appeal to our brother miners, to their families, youth and the whole population of the province to maintain reason'' and end the strikes, the Katowice provincial council said after a special meeting. Miners were told over loudspeakers they could be fired if they did not return to work, but they ignored the warning. Dozens of police vans moved into the area around <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, center of the labor unrest, but there were no signs of immediate plans to end the strikes by force. `` We are not afraid. All the other miners are with us!'' shouted an unidentified striker at the gate of the July Manifesto Mine, where the coal strikes began Tuesday. `` We do feel danger,'' said <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stawski </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` but we get used to it.' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> rally that employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, where he works as an electrician, were prepared to stop work Monday. `` Fantastic! We were waiting all the time for <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to join in,'' said a woman at the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. She spoke on condition of anonymity. A strike by <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard workers eight years ago gave birth to Solidarity. The free trade union movement had a 15-month legal existence before it was suppressed and outlawed after martial law was imposed in December 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> workers struck in May to support steel workers who shut down the huge <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> steel mill. The <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> strike ended with a pre-dawn police raid, and the workers later gave up without a settlement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s call for a sympathy strike was applauded by the 500-600 workers at the rally, who chanted `` There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' said <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Majewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. No talks with management were announced. The strike committee said it was prepared to negotiate if its legal advisers and a priest were let into the July Manifesto mine. Miners are treated as an elite sector of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s working class and earn the equivalent of about $ 177 a month, nearly twice the national average, but frequently are expected to work seven-day weeks under often hazardous conditions. They say their pay is not enough to survive with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 60 percent inflation and nationwide price increases this year of 40 percent. This week's strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages in April and May, which until then marked the worst labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1981. Production was stopped at the strikebound mines, idling about 40,000 workers. It was impossible to determine what percentage of the mine employees actively supported the strikes.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday as a strong leader who has given him `` straight-from-the shoulder advice'' and offered voters a clear `` road map'' of his intentions if elected president. `` I'm proud to stand with him,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address, delivered from his vacation hideaway in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> mountains 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. The president will travel to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Tuesday for a series of political speeches, including a joint appearance Wednesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who watched <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on television in his ranch house, said, `` After hearing his speech Thursday night, all Americans could see what I've seen for eight years _ dedication, integrity, and commitment to principle, a strong man and a strong leader.'' `` And one other thing,'' the president said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> has always given me straight-from-the-shoulder advice and counsel, on how we could advance our vision for the future. And he's always been candid with me when we disagreed.'' He gave no examples. The president drew a contrast between the detailed platform written by the Republicans in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and the relatively brief platform adopted at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month. `` That document is a plethora of platitudes and it points up the difference between the two parties,'' he said. `` Our friends in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> wo n't tell you what they will do if they get elected, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> already have. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and our party have spread their road map out on the table for all to see, while the other guys wo n't tell us where they're going and wo n't even give us directions,'' the president said. `` It will take more than platitudes to convince the American people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also had praise for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose for his vice presidential running mate. He made no reference to the controversy over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. `` The strength and wisdom of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was reflected this week in the strength and wisdom of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> itself _ just as the energy and enthusiasm of the party were reflected in the energy and enthusiasm of Senator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on the day I was first elected president. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> shares with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and me a vision of an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a world no longer threatened by the specter of nuclear attack. That's why <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> has labored with conviction for the Strategic Defense Initiative. `` And he shares a vision of opportunity for all Americans. And that's why he's stood with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and me throughout the fight to lower tax rates and increase opportunity for all Americans.'' In the Democratic `` response'' to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, said the Republicans have stood silent on major economic issues such as trade. `` America is paying a heavy price for that Republican neglect and indifference,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in the radio remarks taped Friday for broadcast Saturday.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sent three merchant vessels into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Saturday for the first time in nearly eight years but said one of them was shadowed by an Iranian helicopter gunship and a warship. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its navy, backed by helicopters, intercepted and searched the vessel, the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> but allowed it to proceed after finding no weapons aboard. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> sought to test its right of navigation in the gulf after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect in the region early Saturday morning. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it launched a number of boats into the strategic <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway to `` display their power and readiness to defend the borders of our Islamic homeland.'' Sovereignty over the waterway, which flows between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea at the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, is a key point of dispute between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In another development, Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Golamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said the port of <LOCATION> Genaveh </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, with a capacity to export 2 million barrels of oil a day, renewed operations. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said that with the cease-fire taking effect, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was giving top priority to the reconstruction of the oil industry to generate foreign currency reserves from oil exports. Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahim </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zalah </LOCATION>, a 35,338-ton government-owned tanker, sailed from the northern gulf a few hours after the truce began at 7 a.m. The minister, quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, did not say which port the ship sailed from. He said the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON> sailed from the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> coast of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and was later shadowed by an Iranian helicopter gunship and a `` war vessel'' as it passed through the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, gateway to the gulf. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> made `` an open attempt to provoke the ship.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> quoted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> officers as saying the ship was intercepted and searched in the Hormuz by `` naval units supported by helicopters.'' It said the ship was found to be empty and allowed to proceed. Iranian naval chief Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> said earlier <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would continue to intercept ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> until a comprehensive settlement was reached in the war. The Iraqi captain of the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, speaking in a ship-to-shore contact with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, declined to discuss his cargo and said `` there are no problems.'' He did not mention Iranian helicopters or warships. A third Iraqi merchant vessel, the <PERSON> Idrissi </PERSON>, sailed into the gulf from the port of <LOCATION> Khor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Zubair </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on its way to the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the Iraqi agency reported. No other details on the ship were given. Earlier, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio quoted Iraqi naval commander Rear Adm. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> as saying that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> searched ships, that would be a `` a serious violation of the cease-fire'' and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would `` strongly resist'' such a measure. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Iranian forces launched a number of boats flying the Iranian flag into the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers watched. `` Complete calm exists on both shores of the river,'' it said. The radio report did not say what type of boat was launched or precisely where. The <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> is the only navigable channel between the Gulf and the city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only major port.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate For Democracy In Burma</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people rallied Saturday in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital to demand a return to multi-party democracy, one day after the country got its first civilian leader in 26 years. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said 112 people were killed Aug. 8-12 in the capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, in rioting that led to the ouster of hard-line leader <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. Earlier govenment figures put the death toll at about 95. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> estimated 4,000 people rallied peacefully in front of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which became a gathering place for protesters after troops reportedly fired on doctors and nurses there Aug. 2. It has not been possible to get reliable details on the incident. But the government Saturday denied some demonstrators' charges that medical personnel were killed. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> as saying three female nurses and one male nurse trainee were wounded. Of the female nurses, only two required treatment, it said. A <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who arrived in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said security forces still were patrolling the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital on Saturday, `` but they are relaxed. The situation is much less -LRB- tense -RRB- than a few days ago.'' Violence flared in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> after leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned last month and hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, widely hated for his brutal supression of dissent, succeeded him. Tens of thousands of student-led protesters battled security forces across <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, demanding <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation, democratic rights and an easing of economic hardships in a nation where rigid socialism and isolationism have spelled economic ruin. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power. The protests continued but focused on a demand for an end to one-party rule. On Friday, the nation's attorney general, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, succeeded <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> as state president and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became the first civilian leader since Ne Win led a 1962 military coup and replaced democracy with a military-dominated, one-party system. One of <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s first acts Friday was to address the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He urged reconciliation, noted the complaints of workers and students, cautioned against anger and vengeance in seeking out those behind the violence, and said every attempt must be made to prevent it from recurring. The Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was important that <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s speech `` did not rule out a multi-party system.'' The diplomat described <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> as `` kind of a compromise candidate'' who `` was not in the queue to be leader'' but who has shown concern over the students' demands and is a civilian. The Asian diplomat, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, said Burmese had a mixed reaction to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s speech. `` There is one group of people who say they will wait and see what he can do to meet the people's desires and demands,'' he said. `` The other group of people say they are n't satisfied with the speech and that they do n't expect the ... ruling circle to keep whatever promise it makes. `` It is too early to tell which group is the majority,'' the diplomat said. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> moved Friday to defuse the situation by forming a committee to determine `` the wishes of the people.'' `` People are waiting for the committee. It has to report -LRB- to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- by the end of September and then we will see where the real power lies,'' said the diplomat. Peaceful pro-democracy rallies were held almost daily last week. Observers say <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s real test will come Monday, when students have called for a nationwide strike to demand the one-party system be dismantled. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, quoting the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said 112 people were killed and 267 wounded in the riots in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Previous broadcasts had said about 95 people were killed and 240 wounded in the Aug. 8-12 nationwide rioting, during which security forces repeatedly fired to disperse crowds.

<TEXT>
 A former top aide to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> portrays the late president as a fearful man whose `` world started slipping from his control in 1965'' because of the pressures of political opposition and the Vietnam War. In a book titled `` Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties,'' former <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> senior speechwriter <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> describes him as a president intensely fearful of his political rivals and wont to lapse into irrational ramblings about them. The book, soon to be published by <PERSON> Little-Brown </PERSON>, quotes <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> referring to blacks as `` niggers,'' describing top foreign service officials as `` those damn <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me,'' and accusing liberals and top newspaper columnists of being communists. An advance chapter of the book, provided to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by an agent for the author, focuses on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s behavior in 1965, the year when he was at the height of his political power. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was planning the first full-scale commitment of troops to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, while in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he was pushing landmark legislation on poverty and civil rights. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, although not a trained psychologist, argues <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> exhibited paranoid behavior. The conclusion is based on <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>'s observations as well as discussions about <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> the author had at the time with a psychiatrist `` <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had become a very dangerous man,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> writes. `` There is no question in my mind that both the atmosphere of the White House and the decisions taken until 1965 -LRB- the only period I personally observed -RRB- were affected by the periodic disruptions of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s mind and spirit.'' `` Although, I never lost my affection and admiration for the man,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> says, `` <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s world started slipping from his control in 1965 with pressures dissolving his confidence in his abilities to control events.'' Debate on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at cabinet meetings was frowned upon and cabinet members warned senior aides not to offer any criticism of the war. Still, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> seemed well aware of the perils that awaited the nation there. On July 14, two weeks before he ordered 100,000 soldiers sent to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> writes, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said of the war in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>: `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is like being in a plane without a parachute, when all the engines go out. If you jump, you'll probably be killed, and if you stay in you'll crash and probably burn.'' The ill-feeling the man who was president from 1963 to 1969 had toward <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, liberals and the press has been well documented in past accounts. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>'s book provides quotations of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> from <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>'s diary that support and elaborate on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s well-known feelings. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> suspected <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of engineering civil rights disturbances to discredit him. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> saw his chance. He saw I was in trouble so he put -LRB- Martin Luther -RRB- King on the payroll to rile up the Negroes. That's why we had the riots,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> quotes him as saying. Shortly before delivering a major foreign policy address, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> to delete several proposals on arms control because they too closely resembled ideas supported by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` I do n't want one word in there that looks like I'm copying <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, according to the book. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> made no secret of his dislike for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, but said he was mystified by the president's concern over his activities, writes <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, who was also a close friend of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator and later a campaign aide. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, a novelist, free-lance reporter and playwright, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once told him after a private meeting with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> that he could n't stand the president, `` But he's the most formidable human being I've ever met.''

 Like letters to a friend, the feelings expressed in a survey of drought-weary retailers reveal the hurt, despair and uncertainty gripping businesses as they struggle to survive the worst drought in decades. `` I love my town and the people in it, but if this continues, we are not going to be able to afford to live here,'' a <LOCATION> Cavalier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> retailer wrote in response to a state <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey on the drought. As the hot weather sucked the life from income-producing wheat fields and pastures across the state, it dried up sales for many store owners who deal with farmers, the surveys show. `` Some days you wonder if it's worth turning on the lights,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> business owner. `` You always wonder if <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> or <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> will still be farming next year. By the same token, we wonder if we'll still be here.'' `` The way our books are looking at this time, we are in the red and afraid of the long winter,'' said a <LOCATION> Dickey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> business owner. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mailed surveys to 700 retail businesses July 27, trying to measure how much state revenues might decline because of the drought. About 280 businesses returned the questionnaires by Aug. 10. The numbers provide the evidence of the drought's effects _ 64 percent of the respondents reported reduced sales from what the owners had expected. Tax Commissioner <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Heitkamp </PERSON> agreed to make the surveys public, but excluded the names of the businesses and any sales figures. Respondents were promised confidentiality. `` It is just hard to see the hurt that is on these pages,'' she said. `` It is hard to see the despair in the small towns.'' One <LOCATION> Barnes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> business compared the state's economy to the Great Depression. `` The dirty'80s have not left us, and I do not look for a big increase in sales for several years.'' `` It takes two years to get back to normal after a drought, in my opinion,'' wrote a Foster County retailer. `` It is going to be a long, hard winter for all of us.'' `` We'll have to put all of our help on unemployment this fall, and I had to take a second job! We may have to refinance just to keep the doors open,'' wrote a <LOCATION> Bottineau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> businessman. One business reported surviving tough times for years due to dry weather. `` By 1983, even our business was beginning to slow down,'' wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> store owner. `` Interesting note: One week in July 1983 grossed more than the whole month of July 1988.'' `` The drought is just another nail in the wooden box,'' said a <LOCATION> Mountrail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> business that has also been hit by hard times in the state's oil-producing sector. There were many pleas for help. `` Some place along the line, someone is going to have to help us out,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Cavalier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> business wrote. `` If that does n't happen, then you might, as it has been suggested, turn this area into a great national park.'' A handful of businesses sympathized with the farmers, but said farmers always get bailed out of their problems. `` What about the small-business person? We never get help,'' a <LOCATION> Burleigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> respondent wrote. Three business owners used the surveys to write their companies' obituaries `` Our sales will drop to zero very soon as we intend to close this business and seek employment in another state,'' one <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> retailer wrote. But several retailers found a silver lining in the drought. `` We have sold twice as many bird baths than we expected to. People are feeling sorry for the birds. It was a real different twist for our sales,'' a <LOCATION> Ward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> retailer wrote.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of mourners jammed the grounds of the world's largest mosque Saturday and chanted praise as President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> was buried. Acting President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said he asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help investigate the `` dastardly crime'' of the crash Wednesday that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and 28 other people aboard a military C-130 plane. `` We do suspect that a C-130 is such a stable plane that it does n't disintegrate into thin air,'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> told reporters at his first news conference since taking office as president. `` The enemy has penetrated the inner defenses of the country,'' he said. But he added that he had no proof that sabotage was to blame and that it would be `` pure speculation'' to cast suspicion on any group. As <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s funeral cortege moved slowly through the streets toward this city's white, futuristic Faisal mosque, the nearly all-male crowd bade him farewell with chants from the Koran, the holy book of Islam. Police would not give an estimate, but reporters estimated more than 200,000 mourners. Dozens of men clambered onto the mosque's vaulted roof, clinging to the soaring dome and pinnacle, and shouted praise for <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, an army general who ruled <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for 11 years. Other officials seemed certain the crash was no accident. `` It's generally felt that it was sabotage,'' Gen. <PERSON> Imranullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, one of many senior army officers at the funeral, told a reporter He refused to elaborate. `` The crash of President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>'s aircraft was definitely sabotage, but the investigation is still under way,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Nasim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> was quoted by the Urdu-language newspaper <PERSON> Jang </PERSON> as saying. Reports of sabotage have appeared in Pakistani newspapers every day since <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s plane crashed, but most were unattributed and gave no details. Mourners, many drenched in sweat from the 93-degree heat, surged for a final look as <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was buried on the mosque's front lawn under a canopy of green and white, the colors of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Officials and relatives threw handfuls of earth on the coffin to the sounds of a 21-gun salute. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, fired by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> as prime minister in May, picked up a shovel and joined dignitaries in filling the grave. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> joined other foreign envoys in laying wreaths at the grave. Mourners began streaming toward the mosque early Saturday morning, many shielding themselves from the sun with umbrellas and stopping for water at the gates of the swank villas lining the wide boulevard to the mosque. `` My heart is crying for -LRB- Zia -RRB-, and I am praying for his salvation,'' said <PERSON> Mian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihtishamuddin </PERSON>, 74, who came by bus from <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, 100 miles west of the capital. Many expressed admiration for <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s efforts to broaden the influence of Islam in this country of 107 million. The funeral cortege began its three-mile journey from the president's office shortly after noon with <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s coffin inside a military ambulance. The procession was broadcast live by state-run television, and cameras focused briefly on the tear-stained faces of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Shafiq </PERSON>, and a son, <PERSON> Ijaz </PERSON>. Crowds standing as many as 50 deep on grassy knolls on each side of the road strained to catch a glimpse of the flag-draped coffin covered with tinsel and flowers. Soldiers with bayonets and riot police with bamboo sticks lined the streets. Among the mourners were at least 600 men sent by Afghan guerrilla leaders who long have received support from <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in their fight against the Soviet-backed Marxist government in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Strung cross the road in front of the mosque was a sign that read: `` Dear <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. Our hearts mourn and shed tears on your sad demise. Afghan mujahedeen -LRB- guerrillas -RRB-.'' Investigators were still searching for the cause of the crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, and 28 others. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> landed Friday night with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, designated to replace <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>. The 64-year-old <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since seizing power in a bloodless, military coup in 1977. He was a staunch ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which appreciated the help he gave the Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> praised the smooth transfer of power to <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s constitutional successor. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a 73-year-old civilian, so far seems acceptable both to the powerful military and to opposition politicians, analysts here have said.

 Iraqis crowded into stores and waved flags Saturday on the first day of a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but the government said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> violated the truce by killing an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldier. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers reported no violations on the front. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also said that in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, an Iranian helicopter gunship and a `` war vessel'' shadowed an Iraqi merchant ship, one of three sent into the gulf waters to test the truce. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an Iranian soldier infiltrated an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ground position and shot a private. It did not say whether the Iranian soldier was captured. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not retaliate for the Iranian violation,'' the Iraqi agency said. It was not clear exactly where the incident occurred, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment. Earlier, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Slavko </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the ceease-fire was holding. He said he had `` no information about violations and everything is going very fine.'' Most of the 350-man observer group began patrolling the 730-mile warfront at 7 a.m. Saturday, capping a year-long effort by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to halt a war that has cost an estimated 1.5 million dead and wounded since it broke out in September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the cease-fire shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved it in July 1987, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted it only July 18 after a series of defeats. <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON>'s chief assistant, Canadian Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Annand </PERSON>, told reporters that a few technical hitches in transport and communications were `` the growing pains of a new mission with two countries who have absolutely no experience with this type of thing.'' Cease-fire celebrations continued into the morning. Processions of drivers honking their horns wound through the streets of this city of 3.5 million, many waving <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> flags. Many Iraqis celebrated the cease-fire at shopping centers, where they have suffered severe shortages of consumer goods over recent years. Minister of Trade <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> termed the day `` an economic festival'' to mark celebrations of the `` great victories scored by our people.'' In an interview published by the official <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Qadissiya </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> ordered the ministry to flood state-run stores and local markets with goods. `` The goods will be unlimited in quantity and that includes all kinds of goods available at the ministry's stores,'' including such sought-after items as televisions, radios, freezers and other electrical appliances, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said. Iraqis lined up in front of state department stores by the hundreds to get first crack at the new goods. Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahim </PERSON> said an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> merchant vessel, the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, sailed from Fujairah in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and was later shadowed by an Iranian helicopter gunship and a `` war vessel'' as it passed through the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, gateway to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The minister, quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> made `` an open attempt to provoke the ship.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, claimed Iranian naval units backed by helicopters `` intercepted and searched'' the ship but let it go when no weapons were found. Iranian naval chief Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> said earlier that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would continue to intercept ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> until a comprehensive settlement was reached. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio quoted Iraqi naval commander Rear Adm. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would `` strongly resist such a measure,'' which he called a serious violation of the cease-fire. In a welcome sign of a gradual return to normal life, an Iraqi jetliner completed the first Basra-to-Baghdad flight since the early days of the war. Civilian traffic was halted at <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'s airport when Iranian shelling devastated the southern port city Iraqi soldiers continued to man anti-aircraft batteries atop many of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s major high-rise buildings, and the government warned that `` the road to peace might be littered with hardships.'' Iraqi and Iranian negotiators are to meet face-to-face Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to begin work on a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. An unidentified Iraqi military spokesman was quoted in Saturday's newspapers as saying: `` The cease-fire is likely to lead to comprehensive peace for which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been endeavoring. But there could be some who will try to hamper this process. This requires that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> should remain vigilant and not be complacent.''

<HEAD>Chile Police Commander Says He Might Be Willing To Negotiate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of the Chilean military junta says he would be willing to negotiate with the civilian opposition on far-reaching political changes if the government's candidate is defeated in this fall's plebiscite `` If the ` no' wins -LRB- in the yes-or-no vote -RRB-, there would have to be an accord between those who won the majority and the junta,'' Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Saturday. `` And if they want changes in the constitution, well, there would have to be an agreement on what those changes would be.'' It was the first time a member of the four-man junta, which includes the president, Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, seemed to accept the opposition's argument that the defeat of the junta's nominee should be interpreted as a vote of no confidence that could lead to constitutional reform. <PERSON> Stange </PERSON>, who is also commander of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s national police, made his comments Friday in his office in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, to reporters for the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> newspaper and The Independent of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has been in power since the bloody right-wing coup in 1973 that overthrew elected-Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has overall control of the nation's political direction but shares power with the other three members of the junta. Sometime this fall, probably in October, Chileans are slated to vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a single candidate for president, to be chosen by the junta late this month. It is expected that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will be that candidate. According to the constitution, which was enacted by the junta in 1981, if the junta candidate is defeated, then <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would stay in power for one year and hold open elections. If <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> wins the plebiscite, he would stay in power until 1997. <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> put no limits on what could be negotiated between the junta and civilian political leaders in case of a `` no'' victory. Even the armed forces' wide powers in the national security council could be discussed, he said. Previously, military authorities have rejected any suggestion that a possible defeat in the plebiscite might lead to major structural changes in the system. <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> even questioned whether <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> should be the man on the ballot in the plebiscite. The nominee should be `` someone who has the will and ability to unite all Chileans so that the transition to democracy occurs in peace and stability,'' he said. Asked if <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is best equipped to fulfill these requirements, <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> said: `` That is a difficult question. ... My responsibility is to find a candidate acceptable to the majority.'' The ideal candidate should be a civilian, <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> said.

 A traffic patrolman who wrote more than 1,000 bogus tickets and gave some motorists a break will remain with the police department, his superiors have decided. `` I've lost 15 pounds over this. It's a hard way to diet,'' said patrolman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>, a 17-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He was given a 25-day suspension last month after the deception surfaced, and officials decided last week to keep him on the force. `` I just could not bring myself to write tickets. I had a conscience. l had a heart. I started seeing the human beings behind the wheel,'' the 36-year-old officer explained in an interview Thursday. A computer listing indicated <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> had written more than 1,000 tickets since 1981 to people for whom state employees could find no <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> driver's licenses, Chief Jefferson District Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said. Initially, officials thought only 100 tickets were involved but said later the number had been understated because of poor communication within the department. `` There was no indication that he was shirking his duty,'' city Safety Director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON> said. `` He was just wasting a lot of paper and screwing up the court's statistical system.'' <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> said he started writing bogus tickets because, `` If I gave too many people breaks, my activity level would be too low.'' Police officials denied that there is a ticket quota system and said <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> was motivated by `` self-imposed peer pressure.''

<TEXT>
 About 200 people gathered in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square Saturday on the 20th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed reform in 1968. They discussed the need for more freedom in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as uniformed and plainclothes police stood near the gathering and checked identity documents. Participants had responded to leaflets distributed to mailboxes by a group called the `` Critical Citizens.'' Earlier, police detained the three spokesmen of the human rights group Charter 77 as they walked to the Soviet Embassy with a statement demanding that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> tell the truth about the invasion by Soviet and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks and troops on Aug. 20-21, 1968. The invasion crushed the `` Prague Spring'' of reform pioneered by then-Communist Party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was ousted in April 1969 and expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1970. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> this week he planned to spend the anniversary quietly at his country cottage. Despite pouring rain, about 200 people converged on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the scene of fierce protests against the 1968 invasion. The gathering reflected increased activism by a handful of independent groups formed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began implementing his reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the past three years. A group of about 100 sang the Czech and Slovak national anthems, then discussed what could be done to change the country. Some called for more religious freedom, democratic elections and constitutional reform. Roman Catholic believers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have grown more active in recent months. About a half million signed a petition to communist authorities this year demanding more bishops for vacant sees, more priests and an end to alleged harassment of believers. A young man who said he was from <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> appeared to lead the hourlong discussion, in which there was no specific mention of the 1968 invasion. Western diplomats said those who had initiated the discussion were not known activists. A group called `` Czech Children'' also distributed leaflets calling for a discussion on Wenceslas Square Sunday. Charter 77 spokesmen <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bohumir </PERSON> <PERSON> Janat </PERSON> had announced plans to lay flowers on the square, at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building and at state radio to commemorate countrymen who were killed or injured in violence at those sites after the invasion. But an unidentified man at the square told the crowd: `` Those with the stronger experience are not here. They are in jail. Now the spokesmen of Charter 77 are in the police station.'' It was presumed the three spokesmen would be detained for 48 hours and then released. Czechoslovak law allows detention for 48 hours without charge. Police warned other leading group members before the weekend they would be detained, and left town for the anniversary. Police presence was heavy in the capital Saturday, but few citizens were expected to make any public display of emotion over the anniversary. Commentaries in the state-run media continued to reflect the official view that the invasion was a painful but necessary move because <ORGANIZATION> Dubcek </ORGANIZATION> and other leaders allowed reform to veer out of control, threatening <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s ties to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.

<HEAD>Government Orders Increase In Consumer Goods Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Saturday announced a program to increase production of consumer goods said continuing shortages could undermine <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform efforts. The Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, said it has ordered state-run industries to produce $ 38 billion more consumer goods in 1989 and 1990 than originally planned, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also reported the council plans an 18 percent increase in the total amount of consumer goods originally planned for 1991-1995. It did not say what the original plans were. The new economic directive also provides for an increase in the production of refrigerators and other electric appliances, and promises to eliminate within two years shortages in automobile spare parts. The Council of Ministers directed the Soviet automobile industry to manufacture 2.3 million cars a year by the mid 1990s, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In the first half of 1988, 386,000 cars were produced. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the black market price for a car is at least $ 28,000, about triple the average official price, accompanied by at least a one-year wait for delivery after the order is placed. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the number of refrigerators, washing machines and kitchen appliances produced for every 100 Soviet families is 20 percent less than in Western countries. The gap is even bigger in cars, video, hi-fi and radio equipment. The new economic plan calls for production of 13.6 million television sets a year, up from 10 million this year, and 2 million video recorders compared to 70,000 this year. The government said it will buy Western equipment for garment factories in order to increase by 50 percent the number of coats and jackets produced, and shirts and knitwear by 20 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. It did not say how much Western equipment would be purchased for the clothing industry, or where it would be bought. In the past, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invested heavily in manufacturing equipment, but many times has not been able to install or operate it properly. Shops selling fashionable clothes are rare in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the more attractive goods often are sold out the same day they are displayed. Long lines form for many other goods that are of poor quality but are in short supply. The ministers said the three years of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform efforts have failed to improve the supply of goods to Soviet consumers and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader himself has repeated the criticism many times. The Soviet leader has encouraged decentralization of control over local industry managers and better pay incentives for good work to try to improve the supply and quality of consumer goods _ a major goal of his reforms. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his advisers acknowledge that consumers still are no better off than they were when the reforms began. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at the end of July `` pointed out that the ongoing scarcity of goods has an adverse impact on people's attitudes to perestroika -LRB- or restructuring -RRB-, subverts their trust in the reality of the transformations planned.'' But the new government plan says nothing about improving the chronically poor quality of Soviet goods, which Western economists say is the crucial problem. They say production actually should be reduced in many cases to allow production of more modern and popular items.

 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are no longer citizens of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, but they may obtain temporary two-year passports from the kingdom if they need a travel document, officials said Saturday. It was the latest in a series of decisions by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to sever links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and turn over responsibility to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` All citizens residing in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> before July 31 are considered Palestinian citizens, not Jordanians,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the official <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents can `` obtain temporary Jordanian passports, valid for two years, if they desire.'' The old five-year passports issued to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents before July 31, the date that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced he was cutting links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, will be valid until their expiration date. But after then, residents can obtain only the two-year document. Another senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new law would `` allow <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents to travel, but not to qualify for Jordanian citizenship.'' About 850,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents carry a permanent Jordanian passport, valid for five years and renewable on demand for another permanent passport. In addition, a minority of the 650,000 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> residents already hold temporary Jordanian passports valid for three years. They will be replaced with the two-year passports upon expiration. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has dissolved the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, half of whose members were Palestinian; dissolved the occupied territories ministry; canceled a $ 1.3 billion development plan for the territories; and laid off or retired thousands of state employees. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> said if schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> opted for the Jordanian system, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> would make arrangements for exams to be held on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But he said the `` tests would be corrected and grades would be given by the ministry in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War.

 Five children died Saturday in a smoky blaze at their grandmother's apartment in a high-rise housing project, officials said. The grandmother, four other children including a 9-month-old, and two firefighters were injured. A new alarm system was being hooked up in the hallway but was not yet in operation, said acting city housing director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>. A smoke-alarm in the apartment near the bedroom was inspected and replaced in March, he said, adding that it was up to the tenants to keep the batteries fresh. The fire at the city-operated Curry Woods project apparently began in the kitchen of the small apartment at about 4:20 a.m., said Police Lt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Loehwing </PERSON>. It did not spread to other apartments. `` This is the worst fire I can remember, especially over in the projects,'' Loehwing said. The fire was not believed to be arson-related, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McComb </PERSON>, a Fire Department battalion commander, but authorities were investigating. The nine children were listed as residents of the third-story apartment and were in the custody of their grandmother, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, 62, said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeon </PERSON>, manager of the seven-building project. <PERSON> McComb </PERSON> said the children's relationship to each other was unclear. He said they apparently were members of separate families, one with three children and the other with six. Officials identified the dead as <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, 5; <ORGANIZATION> Eugene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cousins </ORGANIZATION>, 6; <ORGANIZATION> Rashica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cousins </ORGANIZATION>, 7; Jarmine Cousins, 10; and <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, 9. They died in their sleep of smoke inhalation. `` They were all in bed. They never woke up,'' <PERSON> McComb </PERSON> said. Mrs. Cousins and three of the injured children, including a 9-month-old infant, were in critical condition, hospital officials said. The other surviving child, <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, 14, was treated for smoke inhalation and released. He said he escaped through the front window and climbed down a fire department ladder. `` I did n't see nothing. They was in the other room and there was a lot of smoke,'' he said of his relatives. `` I'm trying to take it. I feel very sad.'' <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 17, said she was sitting outside the building when the fire started. `` We smelled something burning and it got stronger. When the smell got strong we got up and looked at the windows, and that window just burst out,'' she said. `` We were yelling at the windows for the family to come down. There were men out here with sheets yelling to throw the baby. We were telling them to drop the baby but nobody did.''

 As the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> approach, supermarket checker <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> vividly recalls singing to the world during the opening ceremonies of the Summer Games four years ago. `` It was the most spectacular moment. It was bigger than life,'' she said. `` It was a really magical experience.'' Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, a musical unknown, sang the hit `` Reach Out And Touch -LRB- Somebody's Hand -RRB-'' at the opening ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Memorial Coliseum. But Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, 34, who still works three days a week as a checker at a market in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in addition to taking part-time singing jobs, is glad in a way that her moment in the spotlight was n't a springboard to a famous singing career. `` I did n't have any expectations,'' she said in a telephone interview from her <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> home. `` I'm not disappointed for what has happened because being thrust in at that level with my inexperience would have been a mistake. `` I really would n't have had an inkling of how to handle it,'' she added. The $ 7 million opening ceremony had a cast of thousands and was staged before a capacity crowd of 90,000 and an international television audience. The show included a 1,000-voice choir, a 750-piece marching band, a 100-piece symphony orchestra, 7,500 athletes and 2,500 pigeons. Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> appeared as the lead singer for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>, a position originally intended for a star of the caliber of <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> or Leontyne Pryce. She said she was first hired by the Olympics as a musician who could serve as a standby soloist. But after Olympics officials heard her sing, they chose her to perform with the jazz choir because they liked the idea of having an unknown singer in the spotlight. `` It was kind of in keeping with the amateur spirit of the Olympics,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said she is happy working as a part-time professional singer, performing solo at banquets and ceremonies and with the group Daddy's Money, which does nostalgic and rhythm and blues songs. `` I have n't really done a <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> act as of yet,'' she said. `` I'm still looking for a repertoire. It's hard to find material you're comfortable with by yourself.'' She said that as long as she can support herself she is happy continuing with her current musical path. `` It takes a lot of artistic development to find your niche,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Police raided a printing company to crack down on a newspaper that published an interview with <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s best-known guerrilla leader, the newspaper's editor said Saturday. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> told reporters that 40 police officers swept into the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> printing firm <PERSON> Imprenta </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> before dawn Friday, arrested owner <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and four employees and confiscated 100,000 copies of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diario </LOCATION>. Police sources confirmed the raid took place, but refused to provide details. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> charged the government with harassing the paper in an effort to force it out of business. `` We have no guns, not even a knife ... The government is trying to put us out of business,'' he said. The government alleges <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON> is the voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla organization, whose insurgency to impose Marxist rule in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has claimed more than 15,000 lives in eight years. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diario </LOCATION> is openly Marxist but has denied links to the guerrilla movement. But independent observers say <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> reflects the ideology and political objectives of the rebel group more accurately than any other publication. The <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> tabloid drew widespread criticism on July 24 when it published a 48-page interview it claimed was the first with Shining Path leader <PERSON> Abimael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> since the rebels launched their insurgency in 1980. Four days later, President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a law empowering the government to close media believed to support terrorists. Lawmakers are studying the proposal. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON> reprinted the interview July 31, the day on which the newspaper's contract with its printer expired. The agreement was not renewed, according to <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>. Since then, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON> has had trouble finding another printer and has appeared only intermittently, <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> said, adding that the government has intimidated <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> printing companies into not working with the newspaper. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> said the edition seized by police was a special third printing of the <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> interview. In the article, <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> was quoted as saying the Shining Path would not hold talks with the government until the rebels were ready to change from a guerrilla to a conventional war. He was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s chronic economic problems eventually would foment a general insurrection led by the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, but did not give a timetable for the revolt.

 <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> president who was found dead Saturday from a gunshot to the head, was described by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official as a brilliant visionary. `` He was a true leader of his people,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salii </LOCATION> was found dead in the living room of his home in <LOCATION> Koror </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s capital, with a single gunshot to the head, according to <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON>, a presidential assistant. It was the second violent death of a president in the tiny, sparsely populated <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island chain in three years. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was elected president in August 1985 following the June 30, 1985, assassination of <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s first president. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>, 54, was pro-American and a staunch supporter of a proposed Compact of Free Association with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which would end <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s 41-year <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trusteeship status. Under the compact, <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> would become self-governing while retaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic assistance. At his inauguration attended by <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders, <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> spoke about the issues facing the nearly 15,000 people who live on eight of <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s 200 islands, which are roughly 800 miles south of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and 600 miles east of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> had been involved in political status negotiations involving the then-Trust Territory of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, established by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1947. He was a member of the first <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micronesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and later was a <ORGANIZATION> Palau </ORGANIZATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> is an area of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> that includes <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Federated </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mariana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. All were part of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Trust Territory. The Marshalls and the Federated States of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> became freely associated states in 1986 after they approved <ORGANIZATION> Compacts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Northern <LOCATION> Mariana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> became a commonwealth. Remeliik and <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> were close friends. <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON> named <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> as his chief negotiator for a compact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which administers <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>. `` He was a brilliant visionary on free association status,'' said <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. `` He was patient and persisted with a constant vision of his country as a sovereign nation in free association with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, principal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> secretary, said she `` was shocked and stunned and deeply grieved at President <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s passing.

<HEAD>Mandela Rebounds From Tuberculosis, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s health has improved and the jailed black leader has an excellent chance of completely recovering from tuberculosis, doctors said Saturday. Leading newspapers, meanwhile, predicted the leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon may be released from prison. The Star, the country's largest daily, said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is `` one step from freedom.'' The 70-year-old <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best-known black leader, was diagnosed with tuberculosis and transferred Aug. 12 from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> to nearby <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is responding well to our treatment,'' said Dr. J.G.L. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION>. `` He is cheerful and is up and about.'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said the prognosis for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s full recovery was `` excellent.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s family asked the government Friday to release <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s medical records to resolve `` nagging doubts'' about how he contracted tuberculosis. The family questioned whether conditions at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> Prison caused <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s illness and whether prison doctors could have made a quicker diagnosis. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> first complained about his health July 28 but was not transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Tygerberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> until two weeks later, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has said. The government insists <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been receiving the best possible treatment. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said doctors who have seen <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> include the Swiss president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pneumology </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzog </PERSON>. Meanwhile, The Star quoted Minister of Information <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> on Saturday as saying security concerns were the main reason <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> remained imprisoned. `` There is no reason to punish him further for the crimes of the 1960s,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> told The Star. `` The government is now concerned with ... what the -LRB- security -RRB- implications would be for the country if he were released.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been imprisoned since 1962. He is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release was under serious consideration. He indicated the government was trying to persuade <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to accept its condition that he renounce violence. The president has been making the same offer since 1986. However, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has said the government's 1960 decision to ban the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which operated peacefully at the time, left him no option but to fight. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> says he will disavow violence only if the government lifts its ban on his group, dismantles the apartheid system of racial segregation and extends full political rights to the nation's 26-million member black majority. The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, is the main black group attempting to undermine the government and apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that influential academics with close government contacts were urging authorities to `` bring the <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> issue to an end.'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Schirnding </PERSON>, the country's former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador and head of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group, told <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> the government should try to avoid the appearance of `` bowing to international pressure.'' But he added, `` the issue must be resolved.'' State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive.

 Two powerful earthquakes jolted the capital Saturday and gave its 6 million residents a scare, officials said.

Another temblor briefly rocked the city late Saturday morning. <PERSON> Orbegozo </PERSON> said it measured 4.5 with an epicenter 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. He said two other quakes of lesser strength struck Saturday afternoon, but seismic data had not been tabulated.

 A federal jury assessed the flamboyant Hunt brothers more than $ 130 million in damages Saturday after finding that they had conspired to corner the world silver market in the late 1970s. The jury said the three Hunt brothers and two other defendants had ruined the investments of the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company, <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, by sending the price of silver to artificial heights. All of the Hunts but one _ <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, 56, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> _ also were found to have engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the silver market. Since the case is a civil one, there would be no criminal penalties attached to the finding. The verdict was a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, which lost millions in the volatile silver market, and a setback for the three sons of the late <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman H.L. Hunt. The jury found that <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fustok </PERSON> had participated in the conspiracy with the three <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers. <PERSON> Fustok </PERSON> is a prominent race horse-owner and brother-in-law of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> crown prince. None of the Hunts would comment, but a lawyer representing them, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, said, `` I'm disappointed and we disagree with the jury.'' Asked if the defendants would appeal, he replied that the jury's verdict `` is just the first step in the process.'' A lawyer for Minpeco, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON>, said the jury rewarded the company's perseverance and `` faith in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. system.'' `` Minpeco is very happy,'' <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON> said. Another lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Corette </PERSON>, said he doubted the verdict had opened the door for criminal charges against the Hunts, since the statute of limitations would have run out. The findings came on the jury's sixth day of deliberations, and only after it appeared that there might be no verdict at all. The jury of three men and three women sent a note to Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> earlier Saturday, saying: `` Very sorry to say we have been unable to reach a unanimous decision.'' When <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> asked them to read the findings they had reached, the jury forewoman answered `` Yes'' to everything except the racketeering charge against <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. She answered `` No'' to that. The judge ordered the jury to continue deliberations after it failed to determine damages in the case. About two hours later, the jury decided price increase the Hunts had engineered cost Minpeco $ 63 million in short silver futures contracts. The jury also determined that the Hunts cost Minpeco $ 24.5 million in interest on loans to pay for its losses and $ 12.2 million in future trades. However, the jury also said the damages should be offset by $ 33.4 million that <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> earned in profits on silver it held during the same period. Because of the reacketeering charge, some of the figures are trebled. <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON> estimated the damages at $ 134 million, but <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said he calculated them to be $ 132.6 million. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> had claimed that <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> and his two brothers _ <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 59, who also has extensive real estate holdings, conspired unsuccessfully with several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> businessmen to corner the silver market. Three others, two Arab sheiks and a Lebanese businessman, are living outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and did not challenge <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON>'s court papers <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> claimed the conspiracy violated anti-trust, commodity exchange and civil racketeering laws. It sought treble damages, some $ 450 million, through the allegations that the conspiracy constituted a racketeering enterprise that used wire and mail fraud to achieve its aims. Because it was a civil lawsuit, <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> had to prove its case only by a preponderance of the evidence rather than the `` beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard required of criminal prosecutions. Six financial institutions originally named in the suit, including some of Wall Street's biggest names, settled out of court for a total of nearly $ 65 million before the trial began. Those defendants included <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ContiCommodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AML </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> Testimony during the trial, which began in February, sometimes sounded like the script from a network miniseries. Witnesses described meetings at exotic locales around the world, and the high finance world of Swiss bankers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sheiks and Wall Street commodities traders. Lawyers for Minpeco charged the Hunts and their co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $ 9 an ounce to more than $ 50 an ounce between September 1979 and January 1980. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> claimed it lost more than $ 100 million due to skyrocketing silver prices that fell back to about $ 10 an ounce in March 1980 when the Hunts failed to meet a margin call for $ 100 million in silver future contracts. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> had a large short position in the silver futures market, which meant it would make money on dropping silver prices and lose money on rising prices.

 One of four Andean condors en route to a wilderness area for an experiment on how to reintroduce endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors into the wild died Saturday. The other three zoo-bred Andean condors were safely placed in secret holding pens in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, and more will be brought to the area in October, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This was a real shock, especially because the first three birds came through well,'' said <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON>. `` But except for everybody being down right now, it has very little effect on the program.'' The Andean birds, all female, are being used to test techniques biologists hope to use to begin returning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor to nature. The Andean condor was chosen because it's the closest relative to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor. The Andean condors also are endangered but they number in the thousands. Scientists are doing the experiment to see how birds hatched in captivity adapt to freedom, fending for themselves in a region without native birds of their species as role models. The four Andean condors were transported in airline-style animal shipping crates. Two came from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. One was from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Patuxent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and the one that died came from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said. `` We're not sure why this particular bird died. We discovered it died just before we released it. So it happened somewhere in transit,'' said <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON>. The 3 - and 4-month-old birds will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures in the forest 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Scientists will prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large population of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors, but whose numbers have dwindled to 28, all in captivity. When the Andean birds are able to fly, sometime in November, scientists will fit them with radio monitoring gear, release them, and monitor their progress.

 President <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was found shot to death in his home Saturday, the second president in a row to die by gunfire in this tiny, isolated <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island chain that has been split by a dispute over a proposed self-governance agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was not immediately known if <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>, 54, had killed himself or was shot by an unknown assailant. Police Officer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Obak </PERSON> at first said an unknown gunman had fired the shot, but a government spokesman said later that a gun was found and suicide had not been ruled out. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlovski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION>, said investigators `` are going along the line it's self-inflicted There are indications that's what it was.'' <PERSON> Pavlovski </PERSON> said he had no details on what evidence pointed to suicide. Vice President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who also was <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s minister of justice, was sworn in as the new president <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON>, 57, will serve out the remainder of <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s term, which ends later this year. <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>, about 4,500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and 600 miles east of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, has been beset by economic and political problems. The chain, with a population of 15,000, has been administered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the end of World War II. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was elected in August 1985 to succeed <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON>, the country's first elected president, who was gunned down outside his home two months earlier. Three men were convicted for the crime, but were later acquitted on appeal. Two of the three were relatives of a political opponent of <LOCATION> Remeliik </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON>, a special assistant to the president, said <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was sitting alone in his house while his wife, driver and maid were eating lunch outside. The three heard what they thought was a shot about 1:30 p.m. The driver checked the grounds of the house and found nothing unusual. About 20 minutes later, Mrs. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> went into the house and found her husband, shot once in the head, <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said. He was pronounced dead at a Police found a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver and a spent bullet, he Asked if the death was a suicide, <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said, `` We're not ruling out anything.'' He declined to comment further. <LOCATION> Koror </LOCATION>, the capital, was quiet. `` The people are shocked, but are very calm. There is no problem. Everything is under control,'' <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said. `` Everywhere you go, the people are talking in hushed tones.'' Both <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> and Remeliik were strong supporters of a proposed <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which would provide for self-governance and continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid. In the wake of World War II, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> placed several groups of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, all previously held by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in a unique strategic trusteeship administered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the past decade, all of the island groups but <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> have approved plans for self-governance. Since 1983, Palauans have voted several times on the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal includes giving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships the right to visit the islands. Palauan courts have held that the compact conflicts with anti-nuclear provisions of <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s constitution, since those warships could contain nuclear weapons. The constitution provides that the anti-nuclear provisions could be overridden by a 75 percent majority vote. However, in several compact plebiscites, the highest voter approval has been 73 percent. Last September, the father of a man associated with a group that opposes the compact and wants to retain the anti-nuclear clause in the constitution was killed. Several anti-compact activists said they were threatened by compact supporters. <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> has long been regarded as a possible fallback site in event the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> loses its military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. One of the islands in the group, <PERSON> Peleliu </PERSON>, was a major battleground in World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other American law enforcement officials were present in <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> at the time of <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s death in connection with a law training program `` They are cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> in the investigation of <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s death,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Afghan rebel leaders said Saturday they expect continued economic and military aid from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> despite the death of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and 28 other people perished in the crash Wednesday of a C-130 military plane. Anti-communist rebels have been fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government for 10 years About 3 million Afghan refugees have fled into northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and that is where most of the rebel organizations have their bases. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, a staunch Moslem, was a strong supporter of the Afghan insurgents. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, a rebel leader who had close ties with <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, said that after the president's death `` I personally met with senior people -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> government -RRB- who assured me the policy will not change.'' <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-party rebel alliance, said he did not expect any major change. `` We never put all our hopes in one person, in one country,'' he said. `` Our support is from God almighty and he will support us in the future.'' But some Pakistani opposition leaders have said <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s policies prolonged the Afghan war and prevented the refugees from returning home. The <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Peoples' Party, a significant contender in the Nov. 16 general election, wants a program to quickly return the refugees to their homeland. It says they have strained <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s economy and there is resentment in northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by local residents who say they have lost their jobs and businesses because of the refugees. <PERSON> Zabihullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddiddi </PERSON>, vice president of an `` interim'' government organized by the rebels, said, `` We do n't see any chance of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Peoples' Party winning an election. We hope not.'' A car bomb exploded Saturday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, wounding six people, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency. In a dispatch filed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Afghan news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> as reporting the bomb exploded at about 11 a.m. on one of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s main streets. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been the target of an increasing number of bombings and rocket attacks since Soviet troops began withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14 between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Afghan rebels did not participate in the negotiations or accept the accord. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Marxist government and had an estimated 100,000 military personnel in the country when the withdrawal began. The withdrawal is to be completed by Feb. 15, and on Sunday the Soviets said they had met their commitment to withdraw half the force by Aug. 15. They also accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the accords by continuing to aid the rebels but said the Soviet troops would be withdrawn as scheduled.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Saturday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` farther and farther away from the mainstream'' and questioned the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president's vow to create 30 million jobs if elected president. The Democratic presidential candidate linked up with his vice presidential running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, for a visit with <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at the LBJ Ranch. After having breakfast with Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> paid tribute to her and saluted late husband for `` the passion and comitment he had to people, especially to people who needed a helping hand and a leg up on the road to opportunity.'' Then they all visited <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s grave, moving quietly beneath giant oak trees. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> never referred to President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> by name but recalled that `` another son of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>'' won the presidency in 1960 with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as his running mate. It was an obvious effort to keep alive the <LOCATION> Boston-Austin </LOCATION> connection that Democrats hope will help them at the polls. At a news conference at the 250-acre ranch, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of conservative Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as his running mate signaled an effort to bring GOP policies further to the right `` My sense is that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is moving farther and farther away from the mainstream while Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are campaigning on Main Street,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The Democratic ticket mates also appeared together at a rally in nearby <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> before splitting up. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> headed to a county fair in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on his way home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> traveled to a fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inspected prize-winning cattle, fed milk to a calf and rode on a mule-pulled cart. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Monday to attend a national security briefing at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home, to be conducted by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. Both were on the road during the Republican National Convention; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in several states while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stayed close to home in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> except for one quick trip to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. On Saturday they continued to pound away at the two issues they have accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of ducking: the federal trade and budget deficits. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was skeptical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration that he could create 30 million new jobs if elected. `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> once said never put a date and a number in the same sentence,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. ` I think it's good advice. ... I do n't see any evidence that this Republican ticket even understands how to create jobs, especially in those parts of the country that are hurting and hurting badly.'' He declined to predict how many new jobs he could help create as president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> predicted the Democratic ticket would carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, considered a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stronghold until <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tapped <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to run with him. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in a message to his fellow Texans, praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' integrity and record of economic development `` This man from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> really talks our language,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` And that language is one that is understood across the country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued to criticize <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by mentioning <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s leadership role in the passage of several major bills, including a trade bill President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to sign this week. `` On that trade bill this administration was no help whatsoever,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I'll bet they'll try very hard to do that,'' the senator said when asked if he thought Republicans would try to take credit for the bill. There was a somewhat awkward moment at the ranch when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> standing behind him, discussed his opposition to the Vietnam War. President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> escalated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` It was a war that divided this country, that in some ways we're still recovering from,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, accompanied by their wives and Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, were greeted by Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> when they arrived at an airstrip on the ranch. She served them a country breakfast of bacon, eggs, grits, biscuits, peaches and figs. `` I have great confidence and great pride and high hopes for these four folks,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told reporters gathered outside her home on the bank of the <LOCATION> Pedernales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> cattle, a favorite of the late president, roamed across a road as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' motorcade drove off

 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cattle farmers in desperate need of hay to supplement drought-depleted supplies would love to accept <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s offer of help, but few farmers can take the time off to go and get it. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> is having trouble finding volunteers to travel to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and harvest hay because many farmers ca n't leave home for a week to 10 days. The drought of'88 has forced them to haul water and feed to cattle that normally would be grazing and drinking on their own, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, a regional manager for the bureau. A group of cattle farmers in parched southern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is to leave Monday for a 37-hour bus ride to <LOCATION> Orofino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said Saturday that while transportation, housing and meals all have been donated, he still has only 20 farmers who can go. He would like to get at least 40. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> offered unlimited hay to drought-stricken farmers if they would supply the labor for the harvest. The venture is a cooperative effort of the farm bureaus in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, with Greyhound donating a bus for the trip, the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> railroad donating freight space for the hay and three banks putting up cash for meals along the way. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said that while he is having difficulty finding farm workers with the time to spare for the harvest, farmers were extremely grateful for the offer. `` I have never worked on a project that has received the acclamation, pleasure and impact this has,'' he said. `` People become emotional when they learn this has been donated.''

<DATELINE>SZCZECIN, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the main gate of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>'s sprawling, strikebound port, a steady stream of women pushing baby carriages and carrying buckets of food has replaced the normal caravan of rumbling trucks The wives of the longshoremen who went on strike Wednesday are visiting about 2,000 men holed up on the docks of this Baltic city on the <LOCATION> Odra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near the East German border. `` We've got enough food stockpiled to last us a week,'' said a beaming worker in his late 20s. Supporters of Solidarity, to which the men belong, carried bread and vegetables through gates festooned with the flags and banners of the outlawed independent union federation. Shortly after the strike began, negotiations broke down between management and workers, who remain steadfast in their demand that the government grant legal status to their union. In 1981, the communist government arrested many Solidarity leaders in a military crackdown. Solidarity was outlawed in 1982. Solidarity leaders said the harbor strike and a walkout by the city's transit workers arose from growing dissatisfaction with the policies of state-run unions and anger over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s deteriorating economy. The strikes have idled port operations and brought city transit services almost to a standstill. At the July Manifesto mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> in the southwest, spirits also were high. Strikers sitting on makeshift wooden benches spoke bravely. `` We wo n't go back to work until we get a second trade union,'' shouted one miner tanned by the hot summer sun. `` We will stay here until the end,'' said another. Still others cheered. `` We believe the government will have to recognize us because we are in the heart of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s industry,'' said miner <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Golec </PERSON>. Management for the first time Saturday allowed three priests into the mine, and a Mass was planned Sunday. The strikers erected a 6-foot white cross with a picture of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in front of the building where the strike committee meets. Mine officials also permitted workers to buy cigarettes, food and bottled drinks at a lunchstand inside the mine. Meanwhile, some miners expressed bitterness about their economic plight. `` A miner is forced to work Saturday and Sunday to be able to support his family,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowosielski </PERSON>, of the mine's strike committee <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new wave of labor unrest began Tuesday, when coal miners at the July Manifesto mine declared their occupation strike. The mood quickly spread to <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, a city of 395,000 and the country's largest port city after <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` The strike began spontaneously, when we got our paychecks last week,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Radziewicz </PERSON>, a forklift operator who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Interfactory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> representing dock and transit workers. `` It became very clear that we had no one to stand up for our interest and that we were on our own.'' Workers here said they had no faith in the official union's ability or desire to represent them and complained that rampant inflation has cutting into their buying power `` The union represents management and its interest and not us,'' said a young dockworker who spoke on condition of anonymity. A 50-year-old crane operator said he could barely make ends meet on his salary. `` After 30 years on the dock I get paid $ 67 a month. A black-and-white television costs $ 156 dollars. We got an 11 percent pay increase recently, but prices went up by more than 40 percent,'' he said. Transit workers at a nearby bus depot had similar views. `` Reinstatement of Solidarity is the first step in setting up further talks,'' said <PERSON> Romuald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziolkowski </PERSON>, head of the depot's strike committee `` We can negotiate wages later.'' He said 1,800 transit workers were on strike and were posted at the depot's gates, which were blocked by buses. Thousands of residents in outlying apartment complexes Saturday trudged past empty bus stops into town to shop. State-run food stores said sugar and flour were quickly disappearing from store shelves. The run on staples indicated that residents were bracing for the possibility of more strikes and shortages. City officials urged factory and tourist buses in service to aid stranded commuters. But the transit strike has been a boon for the city's taxi drivers. `` Business is flourishing,'' said one driver in downtown <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>.

 A hand grenade exploded Saturday night near a crowded sidewalk cafe and toy store in downtown <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, wounding at least 25 people, including seven members of one family, police and witnesses said. Fifteen Arabs were detained for questioning after the explosion at 9:15 p.m. in the center of this northern port city, police reported. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, 8, lost parts of both legs and suffered head injuries and his 2-year-old brother <PERSON> Yonathan </PERSON> was wounded in the stomach. The boys' parents, their 6-year-old sister <PERSON> Keren </PERSON>, and grandparents who were visiting from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> suffered minor injuries. <PERSON> Keren </PERSON> told people at the <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> the boys were pointing at toys they wanted their grandparents to buy when there was an explosion, witnesses said. At the hospital she jumped from the stretcher to hug her grandfather as he was being carried into the emergency room. A police source said the blast was caused by a hand grenade that was either thrown or rolled along the sidewalk. `` Suddenly there was an explosion. Small children flew into the air,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taub </PERSON>, 32, an art student who was standing near the cafe. `` People were in shock. We tried to cover their wounds. We took off pieces of our own clothing and ripped table cloths to tie their wounds,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> and Rambam hospitals said four of the victims suffered severe or moderate injuries and the others were slightly wounded. The police source, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said three Arabs were seized as they ran from the scene and 12 other Arabs also were detained for questioning. The grenade blew up between the toy store Land of Wonders and the crowded Cafe <PERSON> Kapulski </PERSON> in a pedestrian mall. There were pools of blood, pieces of bloody clothing and a pair of a child's sandals along the sidewalk. Scores of anxious relatives crowded the waiting room at the <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bracha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornan </PERSON>, 48, said she was waiting for her son's fiancee to be treated. `` There was glass everywhere,'' she said. `` I grabbed her -LRB- the fiancee -RRB- and ran.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ornan </PERSON> suffered slight cuts from flying glass. The attack increased tension in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, a city where 223,000 Jews and 20,000 Arabs live.

 Forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hurricane center were watching two tropical depressions that formed in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on Saturday. One formed at midday about 150 miles southeast of the southernmost <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> islands, off the African coast, and was moving west at 15 to 20 mph. It was expected to continue that movement and gradually strengthen, the weather service said. The depressions's highest sustained winds were estimated at about 30 mph, with higher gusts in squalls. The second depression was just south of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, which are in the <ORGANIZATION> Lesser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antilles </ORGANIZATION>, and was moving west at near 15 mph. Highest sustained winds were estimated at 30 mph, but the depression was expected to strengthen as it moved into the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> on Sunday. The weather service urged small boats in the <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to stay in port. Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph. There have been three tropical storms so far in the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> hurricane season, but none reached hurricane strength. Meanwhile, a tropical wave _ a weather system weaker than a tropical depression _ was moving northwest Saturday after dumping almost 6 -LCB- inches of rain in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Friday. Showers and thunderstorms from the wave were expected to leave as much as four inches of rain over parts of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by Saturday night.

 Israeli leftists demonstrated Saturday near a desert prison camp to protest the detention of thousands of Palestinians held without trial for up to six months. In <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, 25 people were wounded when a hand grenade exploded near a toy store and sidewalk cafe. Arab doctors said three Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the army reported <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed three armed Palestinian guerrillas in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police and witnesses said the grenade blew up in downtown <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> at 9:15 p.m. Among the wounded were seven members of one family. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, 8, suffered severe leg and head injuries and his 2-year-old brother was wounded in the stomach. Slightly injured were their sister, 6-year-old <PERSON> Keren </PERSON>, parents, and grandparents who were visiting from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, they said. Police said 15 Arabs were arrested for questioning in the northern port city. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said an Arab from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Tamun </LOCATION> died Saturday, two days after he was shot by soldiers who fired at villagers attacking the troops with knives. It identified the victim as <PERSON> Saoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>, 22. The army said it could not confirm the report. At least 249 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed since the Arab uprising began in December. The violence broke out in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hours after the army lifted curfews in seven of the strip's eight refugee camps, ending five days of restrictions imposed to quell widespread rioting. In its report on the action in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army said soldiers shot and killed three heavily armed Arab guerrillas who were on their way to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to carry out an attack. It said the Israeli troops suffered no casualties. The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, claimed responsibility. The group said its guerrillas raided an Israeli border settlement before being killed. About 200 Israelis, including three parliament deputies, demonstrated near the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention camp in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, said organizer <PERSON> Zahava </PERSON> <PERSON> Galon </PERSON>. The protesters demanded that the nearly 3,000 Palestinians held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for up to six months without trial in so-called administrative detention either be tried or released. About 2,100 administrative detainees are held at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>. `` Anyone who is suspect should be brought to court and in front of a judge,'' <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a legislator of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>, a camp of open-sided tents, was erected several months after the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> broke out last Dec. 8. Thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists have been arrested in the past eight months. The Israeli demonstrators also demanded improved prison conditions and called for a commission of inquiry into a prison riot last week in which two inmates were killed and one wounded. <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> inmates have complained they are exposed for many hours a day to the brutal desert sun and not given enough water. The protest, organized by groups opposed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation, was staged at a gas station about three miles from <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> after security forces barred protesters from approaching the camp. Demonstrators released about 100 balloons at the gas station. `` We wanted the detainees to see that people are demonstrating on their behalf,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Galon </PERSON>. About a dozen followers of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> staged a counter - demonstration nearby, calling for all of the leftists to be imprisoned at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> They also demanded the deportation of all administrative detainees, Ms. <PERSON> Galon </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths shouting `` Allahu Akhbar'' -LRB- God is great -RRB- blocked main roads with burning tires. They also stoned army patrols. Two 18-year-old Palestinians were shot during clashes in the <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp near the Egyptian border, hospital officials said. At <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a 68-year-old man was treated for a gunshot wound in the right foot, doctors said. An 85-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> woman suffered multiple fractions in the leg and foot. <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> doctors quoted the woman as saying she was beaten by soldiers after trying to stop them from arresting her son. The army said the guerrillas seeking to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were intercepted just north of the Israeli-Lebanese border fence in the central section of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone. The Israeli unit spotted the guerrillas around midnight Friday south of the village <LOCATION> Maroun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> a-Ras </LOCATION> and opened fire, killing all three, the army said. The last reported infiltration attempt from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> occurred May 10 when Israeli troops shot and killed a Lebanese guerrilla in the security zone, a six-to-10-mile buffer strip north of the international border. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up the security zone in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, ending a three-year occupation.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would defeat Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 51 percent to 42 percent if the presidential election were held now, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll released Saturday.

The poll found that 43 percent of those contacted said they were more likely to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because of what they saw or read during the convention. Fifty percent said they were more likely to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after watching the vice president's speech on Thursday. The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, found the registered voters thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be better than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at keeping the country out of war, creating good economic conditions, dealing with the drug problem and reducing crime. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was perceived as stronger at helping families and children, it said. Thirty-six percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate made them more likely to vote Republican, while 33 percent said it made them less likely to do so.

 Crack cocaine addicts desperate for money to support their habits are breaking into already needy churches in north <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and stealing everything from children's toys to religious icons. Thirty-five churches in the county have been burglarized an average of three times each this year. `` We are attributing 90 percent of these robberies to drug addicts looking to turn over a quick buck on anything they can steal for a piece of crack ... they do n't care about the sacredness of the church,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> detective <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. Besides toys and religious articles, other items stolen have included toilet paper, speakers, microphones, amplifiers, food, typewriters, telephones, adding machines and yard tools. Most of the churches are within walking distance of crack houses, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, adding that the number might be even higher than reported because many ministers have told him they fear their insurance premiums will go up if they report burglaries. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has been hit 20 times this year, but Deacon <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> has reported only one. `` What can we do?'' <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> asked. `` Burglars break the windows, and every time we replace one, they just break it again. That costs about $ 100 to $ 200 each time. `` When the burglars hit the day-care center in June, they stole toys and $ 200 worth of food and milk,'' he said. `` Can you imagine stealing things that belong to children?'' Deacon <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON> Seventh-day Adventist said his parishioners dug deep to put in a $ 3,500 alarm system in July, but that cut into the church's limited resources. `` Before July, we had deacons taking turns in twos to sit up at the church between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. to see if they could spot the thief,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` He would always strike afterward when the deacons would leave.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the young, Vietnam-era senator he hopes will share the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with him pitched horseshoes Saturday and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the flap over his running mate's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> membership is a `` tempest in a teapot.'' The Democratic contenders sought political solace at the grave site of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> controversy vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received some favorable news from a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll released Saturday. It said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would defeat Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 51 percent to 42 percent if the presidential election were held now. The poll of 1,000 registered voters found that 43 percent of those contacted said they were more likely to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because of what they saw or read during last week's Republican convention. Fifty percent said they were more likely to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after watching the vice president's acceptance speech on Thursday. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during an appearance at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION> to answer questions about the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. The current vice president said his reasoning in selecting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate `` was very sound, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to see that, loud and clear.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceding that questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had overshadowed their campaign plans, but declared, `` I think it will turn out to be a tempest in a teapot.'' He said news media attention to the questions reminded him of `` bluefish, when they're swimming around, all in a frenzy.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> defended himself for the second straight day at an impromptu news conference and also said he had not misled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials in talks leading to his selection. `` I told the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign there was nothing embarrassing in my military record, and I'm sticking to it,'' he said. On a lighter note at the fair, both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> pitched a few horseshoes along with contestants in the state contest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who pitches horseshoes for relaxation at his home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, scored a ringer after several tries. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not. It was still early in the day when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signaled his determination to fight hard to get <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other Southern states in the Democratic column on Election Day. Running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> confided to reporters that the Greek immigrant's son spooned picante sauce onto his grits _ `` seeming to like it'' _ during breakfast at the <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> Ranch. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was stopping off in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, en route back home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for the night. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was swinging through <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on his return home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After breakfast, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and their wives drove over to the bank of the <LOCATION> Pedernales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where former President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is buried in a family plot shaded by huge live oak trees. `` I have great confidence and great pride and high hopes for these four folks,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, told reporters. Reporters were kept well back while Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and her guests strolled near the grave. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had saluted the man buried there for `` the passion and commitment he had to people, especially to people who needed a helping hand and a leg up on the road to opportunity.'' There was a somewhat awkward moment when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> standing behind him, reminded reporters of his opposition to the same Vietnam War that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had escalated. `` It was a war that divided this country, that in some ways we're still recovering from,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. There was a certain irony given the furor surrounding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s acknowledgement that he sought assistance _ needed or not _ to get into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 while many other young men entering combat in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> The controversy over the war ultimately forced <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to decide against seeking re-election in 1968. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he is and was then, at age 22, a supporter of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the war. He also has said there should have been more of an all-out effort to win the conflict. Although he figuratively passed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political baton to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week at the party's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave it another hearty wave Saturday. In his weekly radio address, broadcast from his mountain hideaway in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president never held back from straight talk. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> has always given me straight-from-the-shoulder advice and counsel on how we could advance our vision for the future,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` And he's always been candid with me when we disagreed.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave no examples.

 Thousands of youths packed a city street Saturday for a rally called to protest the military's selection of a presidential candidate. The protest, which was authorized by the right-wing military government of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, was peaceful and festive. Participants danced, waved banners and chanted anti-government slogans while police remained several blocks away. Journalists estimated the crowd, which filled several city blocks, to number about 25,000. From a colorfully painted stage with the snow-capped Andes as a backdrop, opposition youth leaders urged the crowd to vote `` no'' in the upcoming referendum. `` If he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pinochet </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- does n't leave, we're going to throw him out,'' declared <PERSON> Yerko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ljubetic </PERSON>, leader of a group called <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> for a No Vote `` Our triumph must be at the ballot box and also in the streets, the plazas and the neighborhoods,'' he said. The government plans a yes-or-no vote in early October on a single presidential candidate to be picked by the commanders of the army, navy, air force and national police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who is army chief, is expected to be the nominee. If the military-picked candidate wins the referendum, the candidate will begin an eight-year term in March. If a mayority of voters rejects the candidate, open elections will be held in 1990. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, led a coup in September 1973 that ousted the late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an elected Marxist. His government does not include opposition representation. Another opposition rally, expected to be larger, is planned for Sept. 4. It has not yet received government authorization, but organizers said it will be held even if permission is refused.

 A baby sitter and a young boy drowned when a rain-swollen creek swept their car off a bridge, but two men who tried to warn the victims managed to pluck a second child from the water. `` They're heroes in my book,'' said Detective <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bare </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's fair to say they risked their lives, both of them.'' The body of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, 41, of <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON> was found Saturday about 4 miles downstream from the site of the accident. Rescuers would resume searching Sunday for the body of 4-year-old <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Zins </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Oldenburg </LOCATION>, police said. Mrs. <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> had been baby sitting with the boy and his 6-year-old sister, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Zins </PERSON>, and was taking them home on a rural road about 8 p.m. when a rainstorm flooded <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. Two friends, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Macyauski </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Effing </PERSON>, happened to be watching the flooded creek and tried to warn the car to stop as 4 feet of water gushed over a primitive bridge, police said. After the vehicle plunged into the stream, <PERSON> Macyauski </PERSON> ran downstream and dove in to rescue the girl, who had climbed out a window of the car. <PERSON> Effing </PERSON> hung out over the creek on a tree limb and tried to grab the woman and boy, but the limb broke and <PERSON> Effing </PERSON> was swept downstream a few hundred feet before he managed to climb out. The bridge consisted only of a concrete slab, Bare said, adding that most residents of the area know to use caution with such bridges during sudden storms. `` In the flash flood conditions such as existed last night, it's not at all uncommon for the water to go over the top of the slab,'' he said Saturday `` We've had several instances in the past where cars have been washed off.'' The accident occurred about 6 miles north of <LOCATION> Batesville </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` These slabs -LRB- bridges -RRB- are characteristically found on roads that are quite lightly traveled,'' Bare said. `` This area is the very definition of rural.''

 Military leaders met in emergency session and troops moved across the southern region of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> on Saturday after workers at four more coal mines joined nationwide strikes to demand legalization of Solidarity. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, and the national <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reached `` appropriate decisions ... in connection with the present threats,'' the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. The brief dispatch gave no hint about what the government planned to do about the strongest challenge to communist authorities since Solidarity, the independent union federation, was crushed in 1981. Opposition activists said police and army were on the move in <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, where the 10 coal mine strikes were centered. Unusual police movements also were reported in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION>, the scene of a cripping steel strike last spring. `` There are helicopters flying over Jastrzebie and many army units near. Police are also erecting roadblocks at the towns' outskirts, just like during martial law,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>, a leader of the rightist opposition group <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poland </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> `` We want to appeal to miners to be on the alert, put on all possible lights and make sure they will not take them by surprise.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw long police convoys on the 36-mile route between the <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> and the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>. `` There are many army-and-police patrols, as if they suddenly ran short of police,'' <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosiak </PERSON>, a Jastrzebie resident, said late Saturday. `` Most of the patrols are two soldiers and two police.'' A government spokesman, asked Saturday if he could rule out police intervention in the strikes, said only, `` It's 8 o'clock, and we'll have nothing more for you tonight.'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> carried a dispatch accusing strikers of forcibly keeping some miners locked in at the strike-bound mines and of having `` crowbars and other such objects for alleged defense action.'' Solidarity, meanwhile, observed its eighth anniversary this week. The movement was suppressed with the imposition of martial law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. The government rejected the demand to legalize it and said the strikes harmed every Pole. About 40,000 workers were participating in the coal strikes, which were costing an estimated $ 1.3 million in lost coal production daily. Production was stopped, but it was impossible to determine what percentage of mine employees actively supported the strikes. Spirits were high among 2,000 cargo workers occupying the docks of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s second-busiest port in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> since Wednesday. Bus and most tram drivers there went on strike Thursday and Friday, crippling public transport. The four mines that joined the walkouts Saturday were the 3,000-worker <PERSON> Krupinski </PERSON> mine in <LOCATION> Suszec </LOCATION>, the 3,500-worker ZMP mine in <LOCATION> Zory </LOCATION>, and the First of May and Borynia mines in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>. Authorities confirmed 10 coal mine strikes in the vital coal-producing region of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, concentrated around Jastrzebie, a city of 100,000 people near the Czechoslovak border. Also, Solidarity activists said two more mines were on strike, but the claim was disputed by mine officials. Solidarity activists from the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> issued a statement Saturday announcing `` strike readiness.'' Workers said they would call a strike if police intervened against strikes elsewhere. A similar warning came from activists of the <ORGANIZATION> Ursus </ORGANIZATION> tractor plant outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. On Friday, national Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> threatened a strike Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> unless Solidarity was recognized. A 1980 strike by the shipyard workers eight years ago gave birth to Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union. Solidarity had a 15-month legal existence and signed up 10 million members before being suppressed. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Friday that legalizing Solidarity was an `` unrealizable demand,'' but workers said they disagreed. `` We will not back down from our demands that Solidarity be legalized,'' said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Milczanowski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> docks strike leader. `` The authorities must realize if they want improvement, they must restore Solidarity.'' `` I ca n't predict how or when it will end,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Radziewicz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Interfactory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. `` We may win or we may be removed by force, but we can not back up even one step, because there is only water behind us.'' The labor unrest began Tuesday at the July Manifesto Mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most modern mines producing high-grade coal for export. State-run radio and television devoted heavy coverage to the labor unrest, including reporting the demands for legalizing Solidarity. The reports emphasized the mounting cost of the strike. The week's strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages in April and May, which until then were the worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law crackdown. Coal production is crucial to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy and a major source of hard currency to service its $ 39 billion debt to Western creditors. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is the world's fourth-largest coal exporter and its mining operations are essential to its steel, power and shipbuilding industries.

He bypassed reporters at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after he arrived from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> had an `` extensive review'' of Palestinian issues but they gave no details. They said the talks were at a presidential guest house where <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> stayed and <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> aide, also was present. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> Thusday for a private visit at the end of an <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> tour that included <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. He met with Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> Friday and returned to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for the talks with <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government prohibits its officials from dealing directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The restriction has been in effect since 1975 with successive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations, including <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s, insisting that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must renounce violence and recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist before direct talks can be held. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was unable to arrange a meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> last week between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives. Of six delegates proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> through the Egyptian government, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> approved four but rejected two on grounds they were too closely connected with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two people died and two others were seriously injured when they fell while dancing Saturday night in a crowd of 100,000 people at a heavy metal rock music festival, police said. The annual concert was held at <LOCATION> Donington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Track </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Leicestershire </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Leicestershire </LOCATION> police spokesman said the four were `` slam-dancing'' with dozens of people in front of the stage. The technique involves running into other people and jumping up and down to the beat of the music. `` The ground was slippery and it seems they may have slipped and been crushed underfoot. It was definitely an accident,'' a <LOCATION> Leicestershire </LOCATION> police spokesman said. `` Up until then, there had been no problems at all. There had not been a single arrest _ the fans were on their best behavior,'' the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice. Police said the four young men, in their late teens or early 20s, were carrying no identification. The two injured men were both unconscious, police said. Fans watched the rock groups, including Iron Maiden, in the open air on a hillside sloping down toward the stage. No announcement was made over the public address system and the bands were unaware of the deaths.

 A jury's decision that the Hunt brothers must pay over $ 130 million in damages to a Peruvian company is the latest in a series of problems faced by the sons of the late <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman H.L. Hunt. After six months of testimony and five days of deliberations, a federal jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jury determined Saturday that the brothers conspired to corner the world silver market in the late 1970s, thereby ruining the investments of <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company. The ruling comes as the Hunt brothers try to complete settlement of a two-year, $ 1.5 billion dispute with 23 lenders. The dispute has absorbed much of the fortune left the brothers by their father. <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said the Hunts were disappointed by the verdict `` and obviously disagree with it `` However, this is merely a first step in a long civil process that has been going on for nearly eight years,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` Motions, raising other issues, will be filed to set aside or modify this verdict. `` The brothers are confident that this wrong result will eventually be overturned as they proceed through the court system.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 59, and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 56, mortgaged much of their share of the family legacy to cover $ 1.1 billion in losses they suffered when the market crashed in March 1980. The loss also prompted their sisters, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoellkopf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and representatives of another brother, <PERSON> Haroldson </PERSON> `` Hassie'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to separate their fortunes from those of their brothers, significantly cutting into the wealth of their trusts. After the silver losses, the Hunts' <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> went bankrupt and are now defunct. In the spring of 1986, two Hunt businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, failed to make payments on a total of $ 1.5 billion in loans. In July 1986, after attempts to renegotiate the loans failed, the three <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers sued their banks and lenders, charging them with negotiating in bad faith and trying to take over their offshore oil businesses. Soon after, the Hunts put the most valuable loan collateral _ <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s trust _ into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to guard against foreclosure. Later, the trusts of <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> were put into Chapter 11 for the same reason. In the settlement they proposed to the lenders, the Hunts would pay $ 663.5 million from funds raised through Placid operations, primarily in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Hearings on the settlement, which must be approved by the lenders, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevice </ORGANIZATION>, other major creditors and the bankruptcy court were to begin this month.

 Hey, hey it's a whole new generation of <LOCATION> Monkees </LOCATION> fans, and they're not too busy to attend the 1988 Official Monkees Convention. The band, which had six top 10 hits and a popular television series from 1966 to 1968, has captured the adoration of 1980s teens through a revival of its show on cable television. `` I do n't think they're too old,'' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I dream about meeting them, and I play around and think they're still not married and they're my age.'' Despite wrinkles and some gray hairs, band members still draw shrieks and tears from female fans, who gathered by the thousands Saturday. `` I'm closer in spirit to their ages now,'' said guitarist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tork </PERSON>, 46. `` I thought I was older then.'' The convention drew fans, including a handful of men, from as far away as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION>' only performance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, convention organizer.

 Twenty-two members and supporters of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes walked single-file up a seven-mile mountain road to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch Saturday, seeking an `` ongoing dialogue'' on Indian rights. The walk was triggered by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in May, when he spoke of Indians living a `` primitive lifestyle'' and said that, `` Maybe we should not have humored them.'' Before the march, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials met with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and arranged for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Indian leaders, probably in September. `` I would like to thank President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for publicly inviting us to open up a dialogue,'' <PERSON> Wonono </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>, a Chumash Indian from <LOCATION> Goleta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told the group outside the gate of the ranch. `` I hope that he keeps the door open and keeps a dialogue as long as he is president,'' <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> added. `` One meeting is not going to solve our problems, and I hope that he keeps it in mind this is going to be an ongoing dialogue.'' The walkers marched from <ORGANIZATION> Refugio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, chanting, beating drums and playing other musical instruments as they walked up the steep, winding blacktop road. Some wore elements of traditional Indian garb as part of their costumes. One was in the robe of a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk. The leader of the march, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, wore a <LOCATION> Mickey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mouse </LOCATION> shirt. When they reached the ranch, they lined up across the road from the gate while members designated as elders of various tribes led them in prayers and songs. The walk took about three hours. Earlier, about 100 persons assembled at the state park north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. `` This is going to be a spiritual walk,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, a leader of the organization. `` I emphasize this, because it is not a protest march.'' An announcement of the walk issued on Wednesday had referred to it as a protest against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in May, when he said of American Indians: `` Maybe we should not have humored them in wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, ` No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us'.'' <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> said the reference to a protest was `` erroneous'' and the group had apologized to the White House. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> and offered to arrange a meeting between the Indians and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides here to set up a session between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Indian leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> said, he met with <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and M.B. <PERSON> Oglesby </PERSON>, the deputy White House chief of staff, who said the meeting could probably be arranged for September. `` They also informed us the president would not be able to meet with us today as we originally requested,'' <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> said. The president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, were entertaining old friends, Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> and Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, at the ranch. The Wilsons and the Jorgensens were giving a belated birthday party for the first lady, whose birthday was last month. The weather at the ranch, which has generally been sunny since the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> arrived on Tuesday, was cloudy and cool. At <LOCATION> Refugio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> listened to speakers on environmental and other issues, and assembled under a eucalyptus tree for the walk.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report released Saturday said <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> is not cooperating in efforts to return children of Argentines detained under that nation's military juntas. Referring to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, the report said it was `` inadmissible and a matter of serious international concern if a country becomes a hiding place for kidnappers and illegally appropriated children.'' The report by Dutch human rights specialist <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Boven </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, ruled since 1954 by President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s authoritarian government, should take immediate measures for repatriating the children At least 9,000 people suspected of being leftist subversives were seized by Argentine security forces and disappeared during the `` dirty war'' of 1974-81, officials have said. Human rights group put the number closer to 30,000. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Boven </PERSON>'s report said pregnant detainees were placed in secret detention centers where they gave birth and were separated from their children. His report said many of the children were turned over to supporters of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s junta through an unofficial adoption ring, and some of the people who adopted the children fled to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> when Argentine military rule collapsed. The report said some of the `` kidnappers'' forged documents to register the children as their own. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s military rule ended in 1983 with the election of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Boven </PERSON> gave no figure for the number of children believed to be involved. His report said three of 45 such children located to date were found by the Argentine government and the 42 others were found by relatives and the Grandmothers of the Plaza Del Mayor, a private relatives' group. That group has said 182 children were taken from their parents and at least 72 have been repatriated. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Boven </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> denied him entry to investigate the cases, citing pending judicial inquiries. He presented his findings to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sub-Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a vote of confidence Saturday, saying he is `` satisfied that there was no impropriety'' in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enlistment in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. Joining <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in answering reporters' questions at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fairgrounds here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his selection of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. `` The premise for this decision was very sound, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to see that, loud and clear,'' he said. `` I've made a good choice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` So, the fact that there is some flurry out there, and a lot of rumors have to be run down, I do n't see that it's detracting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained that stories suggesting the young <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had enlisted in the Guard to avoid being drafted at the height of the Vietnam War `` were greatly overdone.'' `` I think it will turn out to be a tempest in a teapot,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained that the heavy focus on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> record by news reporters had interfered with some elements of his campaign operation during the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last week. `` Please do n't judge me by this moment,'' he told reporters. `` We've had to shoot down many unfair rumors. There was this flurry, you know, ... like bluefish, when they're swimming around, all in a frenzy. You've made the charges and we felt we had to answer them.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he had not deceived the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign about the circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> nearly 20 years ago. `` There's sort of a sentiment out there impugning the motives of people'' who sign up for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` I told the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign there was nothing embarrassing in my military record, and I'm sticking to it.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he could not immediately disclose the communications he might have had with his draft board at the time. But he repeated that he had asked to have his full military record supplied to him so that he can release it and better answer questions about it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Saturday marched together with their wives, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, in the Paper Day Parade in nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, home of several paper plants. Standing on a freshly painted blue stage on a baseball field, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked a highly partisan crowd into a frenzy with a restatement of his hard-line opposition to tax increases. He said that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tried to get a tax increase past him, he would `` stare them right in the face, and say what I said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> the other night.'' He then paused just along enough to get large numbers of people in the crowd of 5,000 to 7,500 to join him in a chorus of, `` Read my lips. No more taxes.' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> won cheers Saturday from an Oktoberfest crowd of German-Americans near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, when he said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would `` see the Berlin Wall come down.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> watched German folk dances and drank beer from steins at the celebration in Olmsted Township near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, putting aside questions that had dogged them earlier in the day about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military service. Several hundred people jammed into a German-American cultural center cheered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to demonstrate its reforms are real by permitting `` a little more freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a senior campaign official, said that while he thought news reporters would continue to ask questions about the circumstances under which the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think it's behind us. We feel good. We feel upbeat.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he thought there was nothing inappropriate about having a mutual family friend make inquiries in 1969 about the possibility of the young 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` At least he served,'' said one placard held aloft at the ball field grounds. Several other signs among the crowd suggested that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enlistment in the Guard was a non-issue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, emerging from a restaurant here Friday night, said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had not misled the campaign about his military record. `` This guy did the honorable thing and told the truth,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s question-and-answer session Friday had `` relieved a lot of the press pressure. She said the interruption in getting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign message out was only `` temporary.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, a former White House press office official now at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will join <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign as press secretary on Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Report: Attacks Against Americans in Panama Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attacks against Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have increased in recent weeks in what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials see as an effort to force the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift sanctions against the country, according to a published report. Officials of the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> say there have been incidents of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of American military personnel and their dependents, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions. The regime is also refusing to honor visas of some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and has banned mail service at <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military and civilian bases, officials told the newspaper. The officials view the incidents as a campaign of harassment by the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> aimed at pressuring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The Southern Command, the American military headquarters for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, has protested the incidents, but officials said the protests have had no real effect. The Times said the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> reported a June incident in which an enlisted man and his wife were assaulted at gunpoint by a Panamanian military officer who forced the man into the trunk of his car, then beat and raped the man's wife. In another reported incident, a serviceman who got into an argument over a parked car with a man believed to be an undercover Panamanian intelligence officer was taken into a military station and beaten. On August 1, the command reported, four Panamanian military officers detained a serviceman and his father for 24 hours, questioned them at gunpoint and robbed them of $ 300. Two days later, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> enlisted woman was sexually abused by two Panamanian officers, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> officials said. About 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, chief of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the power behind the civilian government, is under federal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which continues to recognize the deposed <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president, has applied economic sanctions in its effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Although the sanctions have helped push <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into a depression, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has refused to step down.

 Protestant lawmakers on Saturday demanded that the government begin locking up guerrilla suspects without trial after a car bomb set by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blew up a busload of British troops, killing eight. Seven soldiers perished in the Friday night blast and one died Saturday of his wounds. The army said 27 survivors were injured. The car bomb blew a crater 6 feet deep in the road and hurled mutilated bodies into nearby fields. It was the deadliest single blow by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> against the British army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since 1982. It brought to 26 the number of British military personnel killed in a summer <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blitz in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. British Armed Forces Minister <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said in a television interview there was `` obviously a possibility'' that an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spy had managed to penetrate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s security forces and that `` is something that will have to be investigated. The bus was an unmarked vehicle and supposedly its route and schedule was secret. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> politician, said, `` I believe there must have been inside information for them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas -RRB- to pinpoint the attack.'' `` What I want to know is who informed the terrorists this busload of men was coming through here,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> asserted responsibility for the attack in a statement to the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> media and declared, `` We will not lay down our arms until the peace of a British disengagement from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is granted to our nation.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said: `` We have no choice but to fight and to stand and to defeat the men of violence.'' At a news conference in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said officials have evidence the explosives were part of several loads of Libyan armaments reportedly smuggled onto the island in recent years. He did not elaborate. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> broke off a holiday in <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON>, one of several <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Protestant members of Parliament who demanded the return of `` selective internment'' _ a controversial policy of locking up guerrilla suspects without trial, last used in 1975. <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON>, in whose <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION> constituency the bombing occurred, was among the first on the scene. He tearfully described going to a barn and finding `` a young man gasping his last, just dying. He had crawled into the most available cover and died over a bale of hay.'' With him at the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> meeting was <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, who lives near the scene of the bombing. `` I heard screams of agony I shall never forget,'' he said. `` The road was littered with the dead and the dying, they were scattered and sprayed across the road, behind hedges; and one poor soul I found wrapped around a telephone pole.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> met later with <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Lt. Gen. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, commander of the British army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON>, chief constable of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, the province's police force. After two hours of talks King would say only that the possible reintroduction of the internment policy was still under review. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Lately, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> appears to have shifted tactics away from attacking local police and militiamen and has concentrated on army personnel from mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. On June 15, a bomb killed six soldiers in their van in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Five more have died in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks this summer in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Of the nearly 2,700 people killed in Irish-related violence since 1969, 76 have died this year, compared with 93 in all of 1987. The number of troops killed has gone from three to 25. <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON>, a member of the Protestants' largest party, the Official Unionists, said of Friday's attack: `` I and the people in this area know who detonated that bomb. The police know.'' He did not name those he believed responsible. `` Internment is the only alternative to a court system which has been unable to put murderers behind bars,'' he said. `` I believe that internment is the only way to deal with these people.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has refused previous internment calls, but Armed Forces Minister <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said nothing was ruled out. Internment was last used between 1971 and 1975 to hold 1,981 people, mostly pro-IRA suspects. It damaged <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s human rights record, and moderate politicians warned Saturday its reintroduction would givr the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> a propaganda victory. The bomb, in a car parked by the road, blew up as the unmarked bus passed carrying soldiers of the First Battalion of the Light Infantry to base at <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. They had just flown in from mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after furloughs and were still in civilian clothes. The army said seven of the dead ranged in age from 18 to 21. It withheld information on the eighth victim. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it used 200 pounds of plastic explosives. The blast, 10 miles from the base, was the deadliest blow to the army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since 1982 when a bomb in a pub killed 11 soldiers and six civilians. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The families of the dead and injured British soldiers are paying the price of British interference in <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> affairs that <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> families have paid for decades.''

 Rain fell across broad sections of the eastern part of the nation Saturday, including heavy rain in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from a tropical wave, and meteorologists watched two new tropical depressions in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Rain and occasional thunderstorms extended from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, including the central and southern Appalachians, and spread into <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Rain in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> came from a tropical wave, a weather system weaker than the tropical depressions that can grow into hurricanes. It dumped almost 6 -LCB- inches of rain at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Friday. The wave moved toward the northwest and up to 4 inches of rain was expected over parts of central and northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The tropical depressions included one that formed at noon about 150 miles southeast of the southernmost <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> islands, off the African coast. The second formed Saturday just south of <LOCATION> Saint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, which are in the Lesser Antilles. Rain also fell on the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and rain was scattered over northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and from southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> across southwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. A creek swollen by heavy rain in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> swept a car off a bridge late Friday north of <LOCATION> Batesville </LOCATION>, and police said Saturday that a babysitter and a 4-year-old boy were missing. A 7-year-old girl escaped from the car and was rescued, and a would-be rescuer was swept downstream before he managed to climb out, state police said. <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, reached 91 degrees, one degree higher than the record for the date set last year. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, reached 100 degrees, breaking a record of 97 set in 1971. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 degrees at <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to 99 at <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 The nation's wildfire control center on Saturday asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to provide a battalion of infantry troops to help suppress fires in the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where nearly 13,000 firefighters are already on the lines. The <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> requested the military assistance to provide relief for civilian firefighters, some of whom have been on fire lines for more than two weeks, and to release expert firefighters to build new lines and deal with more complex situations, said spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>. The fire center has sent 18 instructors to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to train 600 soldiers of the First Brigade Combat Team of the 9th Infantry Division Motorized on fighting wildfires. After training on Sunday and Monday, the troops will be deployed to fire lines in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, military helicopters headed to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> Saturday to assist in the battle against huge forest fires, and fire crews in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> fought against high wind to tighten their control over dozens of fires. Winds gusting to 60 miles an hour throughout the day and evening kicked up fire activity in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. The campgrounds and park buildings at <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> were evacuated and several park roads were closed. The Norris, <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and Madison campgrounds remained closed. Officials expected the 74,000-acre <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> blaze to burn across the park's <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> and steps were taken to protect <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> while crews removed debris and flammable materials from the area. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> officials had called in two military helicopters to assist other aircraft already making water and retardant drops on the 110,000-acre Clover-Mist fire in the park's northeastern section. Outside the park in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, a five-man team launched an investigation into a helicopter crash west of the 6,500-acre Lost fire that killed one and injured three. The 750 people working the fire hoped for a second day of relatively calm westerly wind that on Friday supported efforts to protect a ranch and a group of summer homes. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, south of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, the devastating Warm Springs Creek fire in the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> cooled Friday night after dramatic runs earlier in the week, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, fire information officer, said Saturday. `` It looks pretty good here; we had a real cool night,'' he said. `` There was very little growth in the fire. There was very little wind.'' About 2,000 firefighters were battling to contain the fire, shoring up fire lines on the northeastern flank, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Crews had encircled about 60 percent of the fire, compared with only 30 percent the day before. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast wind blowing up to 40 mph, but temperatures were expected to be somewhat cooler, with possible showers in scattered areas of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, which is suffering through a severe drought. `` It will be tenuous for the next 24 hours,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Saturday. The Warm Springs Creek fire destroyed at least 10 residences and killed 30 head of cattle late Wednesday and early Thursday, but turned just before reaching a mountain subdivision with scores of residences. The fire grew by about 200 acres Friday night, but that was small compared with the 7,000 - and 15,000-acre runs the two previous nights As the fire moved generally to the east, flames headed onto flatter land near the community of Winston, and officials said they would have more of a chance of checking the fire once it left the rugged mountain ridges. Firefighters were backed for the first time by three <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> transport planes used to drop retardant on the flames. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, smaller fires were burning over thousands of acres, many of them the result of lightning strikes earlier in the week, including 46 in the <LOCATION> Flathead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> drainage of northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, firefighters extinguished a 600-acre southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> brush fire near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>, and on Saturday declared contained a 50-acre blaze in the region's <LOCATION> Wahwah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.

 Pro-independence groups in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and residents who want the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> archipelago to remain a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> territory reached agreement Saturday on a transitional plan for the islands' future. But militants quickly denounced the accord. Last spring 30 people were killed in political and ethnic violence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. The agreement provides for a referendum on independence in 1998. During the intervening 10 years the territory would be divided into three provinces with more autonomy. The referendum would be restricted to voters who have lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> during all of the intervening 10 years. Native Melanesians make up only 43 percent of the population. Separatists claim many settlers _ Europeans, Asians and Polynesians _ are short-term residents who want to maintain links with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and outvote them in elections. The ethnic Melanesians, known as Kanaks, also have had a higher birth rate in recent years and expect to form the majority again by the end of the century. `` This is not the finish today, this is a stage,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON>, the minister for overseas territories in the French government of Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON> said the agreement was more than could have been hoped for `` if one remembers the situation the territory found itself in three months ago.'' The breakthrough in negotiations following the violence in April and May came in June when the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, and conservative <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON> reached an agreement in principle during talks directed by <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>. In the Caledonian capital of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the far-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Saturday saying pro-French leaders who participated in the talks had committed treason. It said the accord `` will lead the territory irreversibly to independence sooner or later.'' <PERSON> Yann </PERSON> <PERSON> Celene </PERSON> <PERSON> Uregei </PERSON>, leader of the separatist <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that is a member of <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>'s alliance, said <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> had no authority to sign an agreement. He said the proposal should have been presented first to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonians </LOCATION> for debate. The plan, drawn up as a law to be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, will include constitutional changes that must be approved by French voters in a national referendum to be scheduled later this year.

 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyer said Saturday he will ask <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities not to cooperate with the government if it refuses to allow the ex-president to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to face charges he kept money in secret Swiss bank accounts. The government believes <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stashed millions of dollars in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> during his 20-year rule, which ended on Feb. 25, 1986, when a civilian uprising swept him from office. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said on Friday she will abide by a court order approving her ousted predecessor's return from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he fled after his ouster. On Thursday, an anti-graft court said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or his attorney had the right to be present during testimony of a former government minister scheduled to give a deposition against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in November. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who is a lawyer, said he would demand his right to come home and conduct his own defense. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> told reporters he would send copies of newspaper reports on the court's ruling to Swiss federal and cantonal authorities who are involved in an investigation into secret bank accounts the former president allegedly opened in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` If the government should refuse to respect <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' human right to freely return to his own abode, the Swiss government might be forced to withdraw assistance to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> said that if the government still blocked <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return, it would be in violation of European human rights covenants, which the Swiss have signed. Those covenants state that a defendant has the right to face his accuser personally or with the counsel of his choice. At a news conference Saturday, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the military command would respect the court's decision despite security risks `` Certainly, there are some security implications that may come about with the return of ex-president <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> at this time,'' de Villa said. `` But as I said, and I wish to stress, a court order must be respected and obeyed by everybody.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters include small numbers of soldiers who have been dismissed for involvement in previous coup attempts. But he said they do not have the capacity to topple the government. Others have said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> still commands the loyalty of a considerable number of low - and middle-ranking officers and men

 Federal agents seized about 1,100 pounds of cocaine and made seven arrests Saturday after the drug was driven from a Haitian freighter to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> apartment while under surveillance by both the smugglers and the agents, officials said. The freighter Dieu Plus Grand was watched by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents after the illegal cargo was discovered in a routine boarding Wednesday, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. `` It was very well concealed. We put everything back the way it was so no one would know we had found it,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Agents found the cocaine in a water tank below deck but acted as if nothing had been found and arranged surveillance, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` A van came and people unloaded the cocaine from the vessel into the van. They then left with the van, and we had extensive countersurveillance by the smugglers looking for us, and followed it from place to place,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The smugglers stopped twice, switched drivers and had four cars following the van, but undercover agents kept up with them, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Agents made seven arrests and seized the drug, which had been packed in vegetable oil cartons, after the van stopped to unload its cargo at the apartment, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Five Haitians and two Colombians were taken into custody Saturday. All seven face narcotics smuggling charges, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said.

 A strong earthquake damaged buildings and slightly injured eight people in an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> island, a newspaper reported Friday. It was the third tremor to rock parts of this <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country in four days. The latest quake hit <LOCATION> Manado </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of Celebes island, on Thursday morning, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Suara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pembaruan </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> reported Friday. It quoted sources at a <LOCATION> Manado </LOCATION> hospital as saying eight people were treated, all for minor injuries, and released. At least 17 buildings were damaged by the quake, which registered 5.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the newspaper said. The country's <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that the quake measured 4.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Thursday's quake was centered 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manado </LOCATION> at a depth of 37 miles, the newspaper said. It was followed by 10 minor quakes the same day. On Monday, an earthquake measuring 5.3 rocked the tourist island of <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>. Another one registering 6 shook eastern Java island and <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> on Wednesday. No injuries or major damage were reported in the first two quakes. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. An earthquake measuring 4 can cause moderate damage, one of magnitude 5 considerable damage, and a 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas.

 Corruption among the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s vice squad is systemic but does not involve high-ranking officers, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said Friday. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> declined to identify the targets of the secret three-year investigation, nor would he say exactly what misconduct is alleged. But <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Suddes </PERSON> confirmed the probe concerns possible misappropriation of drugs and cash seized by <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officers. The investigation was kept secret until the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> demanded hundreds of pages of documents from the police on Thursday, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said. `` Until this year, the investigation was extremely covert, extremely need-to-know. It was an intelligence-gathering investigation,'' he said. The case involves more than just one or two bad apples, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said. `` It would be systemic,'' he said. But he added that high-ranking officials were not under suspicion. `` You're basically talking the street cop,'' Almond said. A state law enforcement source who spoke on the condition he not be identified suggested the investigation may involve a group of officers who agreed to underreport the cash seized in drug raids and split the rest among themselves. Police Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. An aide said he had left for vacation and would not be back until Tuesday.

 The modest white house with the pointed-arch window that inspired <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s painting `` American Gothic'' was promised to the state of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Friday so that the `` major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> icon'' can be preserved. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 81, of <LOCATION> Breckville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who inherited the house after his parents died, signed an agreement providing that the state will take control of the six-room frame house 18 months after his death. `` It's my vision that this agreement with the state of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> will continue to preserve the American Gothic -LRB- home -RRB- and make it an attraction,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said during a ceremony on the front porch of the house. Wood, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s most famous artist, received national acclaim in 1930 when the `` American Gothic'' painting won a $ 300 first prize at the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s contest for American painters. The painting, which has inspired countless parodies, still hangs in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> museum. Wood is said to have gotten the idea for the painting after he saw the house during a visit to <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON>, a town in southeastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> with a current population of 1,250. The painting depicts a dour-faced farmer _ Wood's dentist was the model _ holding a pitchfork and standing beside his spinster daughter, who actually was <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who lives in a nursing home in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm tickled stiff'' about the agreement to give the house to the state of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` That house represents real Americans; people who are forthright, hard-working, just ordinary Americans.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said his father bought the house at a tax sale in 1942, which coincidentally was the year <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> died. `` I do n't remember what he paid for it, but it was n't very much,'' he said in an interview. `` The taxes had n't been paid on it so he decided to buy it.'' The house's role in art history made no difference to his father, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` He bought it because he wanted a place for his brother, <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, to stay.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> currently rents the house for $ 50 a month to a couple with three children. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency, said the agreement with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will ensure the house `` will be preserved for posterity.'' `` We will be able to continue to preserve what is one of the most important symbols in the world,'' <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON> said. `` When people see ` American Gothic,' they think of traditional values, not only of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> but of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> particularly.'' The agreement `` guarantees both the preservation and interpretation of a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> icon,'' <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON> said. The Legislature has appropriated $ 50,000 for development and operation of the site as a tourist attraction. Officials said they will improve the gravel road leading to the house and possibly build a parking lot across the street. <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON> said the house will not be moved.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay the families of 15 people killed in a January 1987 train crash $ 8.2 million, on top of the $ 58 million settlement agreed to by <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> two months ago. In addition to death claims, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s settlements also create a $ 9 million fund to pay 330 passengers who filed claims for injuries or distress they suffered because of the Jan. 4, 1987, accident near <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, Md. `` That makes this settlement -LRB- on the death claims alone -RRB- the largest group personal injury settlement in the country,'' said <PERSON> Read </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>, an attorney for the victims' families. Claims filed by the 16th victim's family were settled earlier. `` We think it's a fair settlement and hopefully will put an end to the uncertainty and the waiting period a lot of people have gone through,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> public affairs director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said Friday, a day after the settlement offer was made. `` <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> feels it is in some ways as much a victim in this as anyone else is.'' `` A plan has been formulated where a committee of attorneys representing -LRB- injured victims -RRB- will review the claims and recommend who should get from the $ 9 million fund,'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train collided with a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotive. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer who was at the controls at the time of the accident, is serving a five-year prison term for manslaughter after admitting he'd smoked marijuana shortly before the crash. The total $ 66.2 million the train companies have agreed to pay on the death claims means each of the victims' survivors will receive about $ 4.5 million, <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said. Under terms of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s settlement, the railroad did not admit responsibility for causing the crash or the deaths, <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said.

And tonight the world-class city of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> has the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Oaken </PERSON>, secretary of the state <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. The crowd lined the banks of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as the fountain was triggered. It took 20 minutes for the computer-controlled fountain's 41 jets and red, white, blue and amber lights to complete its program of patterns, which concludes when the fountain sprays a fleur-de-lis _ <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s official symbol _ about 400 feet above the river. The fountain, on an octagonal barge 39 feet across, is a gift to the city from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who donated $ 2.6 million for its construction and maintenance for three years. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, patriarch of a three-generation media family, died Monday at age 82. `` I know that he -LRB- <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> Sr. -RRB- is with us tonight in a spirit of joy and fulfillment,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said he would never see the fountain without thinking of the elder <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> and that the fountain would flow `` as an eternal flame would burn in his memory.'' Plenty of entertainment was on hand, including dancers, singers, an orchestra and bands _ the <ORGANIZATION> 100th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, country music and rock' n' roll. A flotilla of at least 100 boats gathered near the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed to vehicular traffic and was packed with 8,000 to 10,000 people. Interstate 64, which skirts the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> was jammed as motorists stopped to watch the fountain dedication, creating a massive traffic tieup. `` I think the whole city is planning a party,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, executive director of the <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> Sr.. Fund Electrical engineer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavuld </PERSON>, who was aboard the barge, said afterward: `` It ran perfectly. We've had it up to 429 feet, but the 420 feet tonight was right on target.'' `` I thought it was excellent,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, who staked out his spot six hours before the fountain was turned on. `` It's like fireworks made out of water. It's something the city can be proud of.'' The fountain, proposed almost 30 years ago, was built by <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Serodino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a marine contractor who has built other floating fountains around the world. This one sprays the highest, backers said. Plans call for the fountain to operate primarily in the afternoons and evenings from early spring to early fall. When operating fully, it will spout 15,800 gallons of water a minute, more than the average <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> household consumes in two months. The fountain is one of five of its kind in the world, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, an agency promoting the city. <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a member of the development team of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said the second-largest such fountain is in <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. That fountain was rated to run at more than 500 feet but is actually run at less than 400 feet, he said Each of the other four fountains, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said, is a single jet going straight up into the air.

<TEXT>
 Four Andean condors that will serve as scouts for reintroduction of the gravely threatened <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor into the wild are headed for temporary pens in a rugged mountain range. The 3 - and 4-month-old avian pioneers, hatched and reared in zoos, will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures as scientists prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a thriving population of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> species _ a black, vulture-like carrion eater with a wingspan up to 9 -LCB- feet _ has dwindled to a mere 28, all in captivity. Two Andean condors from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Animal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> were loaded into airline-style animal shipping crates Friday evening for a 200-mile trip to the secret holding pens in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON>, a spokesman for the animal park, said in a telephone interview Friday. `` They want to arrive and put the birds in their new home in the dark of night so the birds awaken the next morning thinking they are in the same place they were before,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said as his crew was ready to depart at 6:45 p.m. for the six-hour drive. The birds were not drugged, but were captured and wrapped in blankets by familiar handlers, he said. `` By moving them in the dark it basically minimizes the stress,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. A third Andean condor hatched at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo will join the contingent, along with a fourth, flown in from a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Patuxent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo biologist overseeing the program. The Andean birds, all females to prevent breeding in the wild, will be used to test techniques biologists hope to use _ perhaps as soon as 1992 _ to begin returning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor to nature. More Andean condors will be added to the test flock later. In a $ 440,000 program overseen by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the birds will be taken to a special mesh enclosure, measuring about 20 feet by 40 feet and 15 feet high, in rugged territory. The exact spot is secret to deter the curious or the malicious. About November, when the birds are able to fly, they will be fitted with radio monitoring gear and released. It's expected they will cover much of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor's five-county range, a land of bare grassy hills dotted with occasional oaks, and rugged, rocky cliffs and canyons in the mountains that ring the southern end of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The purpose of the test, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said, is twofold: To see how birds hatched in captivity adapt to freedom; and to see if such birds can learn to fend for themselves in a region without native birds of their species to serve as examples. The program also will help scientists spot such possible hazards as poison bait illegally left for coyotes or lead shot in animal carcasses left by hunters, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. The Andean birds will be captured from the wild when it's time to release their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cousins, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. The first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> birds could be released as early as 1992 if breeding programs are successful, he said. The Andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is the closest living relative to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor. Though the Andean species is endangered, they number in the thousands. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land bird, once roamed widely along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, but its numbers had shrunk to 40 when the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> launched a rescue effort in 1976.

Sales to customers in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> averaged 717,000 barrels daily between January and July _ 54 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s petroleum exports during that period, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the main client. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said the price increases will be 10 cents per barrel for light Isthmus crude and 30 cents for heavy Maya crude because of a `` technical adjustment in export formulas.'' In July, Isthmus sold for $ 13.78 a barrel and <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> for $ 11.21 a barrel in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> told a news conference that `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reiterated its collaboration with the petroleum cartel not to increase its production and to search for the stabilization of the market.'' He said he was convinced of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s commitment to work with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and he hoped `` soon the world petroleum market will be stabilized.'' The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> has begun exports of special diesel fuel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a 30 million-liter shipment from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>.

 A convicted rapist who is accused of slaying a young couple after he escaped from jail in 1983 broke out of jail again, terrifying residents of this small community. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, 41, stymied searchers who believed they had him surrounded Friday in a wooded area near <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Reed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police captured his accomplice in the escape Friday afternoon on a residential street just north of Big Rapids. Authorities suspended their search for <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> after hunting through the woods with tracking dogs and finding no sign of him, said state police Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maturen </PERSON>. The area `` could n't be searched any more thorough,'' he said. `` Once he leaves the immediate area, where's he at? There's a million places he could be. He's still on foot, as far as we know.'' `` We just do n't have any idea where he is,'' <LOCATION> Mecosta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayer </PERSON> said. `` We're all going to go home tonight and sleep on it'' and decide in the morning whether to resume the search. <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> was believed armed with a handgun, <PERSON> Wayer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> and inmate <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, 24, a convicted burglar, escaped Thursday from the <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail after beating and tying up a guard, authorities said. `` Both of them are considered to be extremely dangerous,'' Lt. <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenks </PERSON>, the jail administrator, said before <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> was recaptured peacefully. `` I'm nervous about both of them being out of my jail, but <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> would be the one I'd be most nervous about.'' <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, sentenced to life in prison in 1966 for the rape and beating of a 17-year-old girl, escaped from jail in 1983. He was captured in November 1985 in a Grand Rapids suburb where he was staying with his sister. While on the run, police allege, <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> killed a couple from <LOCATION> Manton </LOCATION>, a small town near here, and sexually assaulted three prostitutes in Grand Rapids. He was convicted of the assaults and was awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges when he and <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> escaped. Police say they never determined a motive for the May 1984 killings. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 21, had his throat slit and then he and his new wife, <PERSON> Alida </PERSON>, 19, were both shot. `` I guess you could call him cunning,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, who investigated the murder. `` On an outward appearance, he does n't expose his violence. He's quite well spoken, soft-spoken, and does not have the appearance of a brutal killer.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, clerk <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinken </PERSON> said he sent his wife out of town to spend the night with an aunt after news of <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION>'s escape got out. `` Everybody is worried, I know that,'' he said. <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, who faces charges of robbing a grocery store, was in a cell next to <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION>'s in the maximum-security unit of the jail. They assaulted the guard and escaped after their cell doors were unlocked so they could take showers and use the telephone, authorities said. The guard, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, was hospitalized in stable condition Friday. <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> was moved to the county jail Wednesday from the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Reformatory at <LOCATION> Ionia </LOCATION> so he could appear at a preliminary examination Thursday regarding the <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> killings. The hearing was postponed after a witness failed to show up.

 A series of mistakes by men, not machines, led to last month's shoot-down by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser of an Iranian commercial jet, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must share some of the blame, say the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s civilian and military leaders and an investigation into the July 3 incident. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired at the Iranian A-300 Airbus in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> because the cruiser mistakenly believed the plane was an Iranian F-14 fighter taking part in an attack in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, according to the report. No <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel will be disciplined, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, as they released the report Friday. `` I believe that given the operating environment, Capt. -LRB- Will C. -RRB- <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> -LRB- III -RRB- acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the defense of his ship and crew,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. All 290 people aboard the Airbus were killed when it was shot down after taking off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> uses as a joint civilian-military airfield, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> noted. The incident came only minutes after the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had fired at some Iranian speedboats which had shot at the cruiser's helicopter. `` By any measure, it was unconscionable -LRB- for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- to ignore the repeated warnings of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to permit an airliner to take off from a joint military-civilian airfield and fly directly into the midst of an ongoing surface action -LRB- battle -RRB- ...,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> declared. But Iranian U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism. `` Our civil airliner was using an internationally recognized air corridor, used five times a week by the same captain,'' he said Friday. The Iranian envoy blamed the tragedy on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` One should conclude that the mere presence of such highly dangerous equipment, which can not be controlled even by trained <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel, is the source of tension,'' he said, and called for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet to pull out of the gulf. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is an Aegis-class cruiser, containing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s most sophisticated air defense system The investigators concluded, `` The Aegis Combat System's performance was excellent _ it functioned as designed.'' But the welter of information provided by <PERSON> Aegis </PERSON> was evaluated by a crew seeing its first combat, and who had been warned about the possibility of attacks from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, the investigators said. `` Stress, task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may have played a major role in this incident,'' concluded the unclassified, 53-page version of the report released Friday. The Iranian plane was picked up by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> as a radar contact and the crew then sought proof the plane was n't part of the earlier attack, the investigators noted. `` The proof never came. Given the time available, the commanding officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect his ship and crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies or ambiguities,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has apologized and informed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> it will offer compensation to the victims' families. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which was scheduled today to begin a cease-fire in its long war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of deliberately shooting the plane down. The investigative report dismissed that charge, stating:

<TEXT>
 `` The USS Vincennes did not purposely shoot down an Iranian commercial airliner. Rather, it engaged an aircraft the commanding officer ... believed to be hostile and a threat to his ship and to the -LRB- nearby frigate -RRB- USS Montgomery.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said that some of the mistakes by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' crew included:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ A conclusion the civilian <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was descending rather than ascending as it approached the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, implying the plane was preparing to attack _ A conclusion the jetliner had transmitted a radio signal identifying it as a military aircraft _ A report the plane was outside a commercial air corridor crossing the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> also had a short `` critical decision window,'' the report states. Only seven minutes passed from the time the ship detected the airplane taking off until its destruction. `` And from the time the CO -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- first became aware of -LRB- the plane -RRB- as a possible threat, until he made his decision to engage, the elapsed time was approximately 3 minutes, 40 seconds,'' the report states. `` The fog of war and those human elments which affect each individual differently ... are factors that must be considered. Stress, task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may have played a major role in this incident.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the investigation would lead to a number of changes in operations, including modifying the devices that display critical information on approaching targets in the cruisers and subjecting the operators of the Aegis system to psychological testing to ensure they are ready for combat.

 Soviet spelunkers, joining explorers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and two other nations, have concluded a 10-day probe of <LOCATION> Lechuguilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cave </LOCATION>, the third-deepest cavern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The cave is in a designated wilderness area of the <ORGANIZATION> Carlsbad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caverns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and is known to be at least 21.1 miles in length. That makes it the deepest cave in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ at least one-third of a mile longer than the surveyed length of the Carlsbad Caverns. The two known deeper caves are in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Seventy cavers from 18 states, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> participated in the expedition. Project leaders <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasier </PERSON> said the group discovered a considerable amount of `` spongework,'' or passageways, that add to the cave's complexity. Among other findings were a 30-inch gypsum `` flower'' and gypsum formations resembling yarn and cotton balls. The cave has a 90-foot vertical drop at its entrance, according to park officials. Explorers have known about the cave opening and entrance room since about 1914. At that time, the cave was mined for guano, or bat waste. Extensive exploration of the cave began four years ago.

<HEAD>Chicago Company Receives Largest-Ever Fine Under New Immigration
Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A day-labor firm will be fined $ 60,000 for violating the new federal immigration law _ a reduced fine that still is the largest ever levied for such violations, federal immigration officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> initially fined Ready-Men, a company that provides temporary help to construction firms and factories, $ 308,000 for hiring five illegal immigrants and committing more than 515 violations in record-keeping. After two months of negotiations, however, the two sides agreed on the smaller fine. `` It's not our intention to put anyone out of business,'' <PERSON> A.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director, said Friday. `` The moment that I'm assured that they are doing everything they can to comply with the law, then I'm satisfied. He said the company was now `` on the right track'' and that the settlement demonstrates the effectiveness of the law. Ready-Man president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Heraty </PERSON> said he felt the sanction was fair and that his company would try to be `` a model company'' in the industry. <PERSON> Heraty </PERSON> did acknowledge that the new law makes his business more difficult and that he occasionally has trouble finding enough workers. `` I have never found so many people who do n't have the ID they need to get hired,'' he said at a news conference. The immigration law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 initially allowed some illegal aliens to seek amnesty and apply for legal residency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The yearlong amnesty ended in May. The second phase of the law, begun in June 1987, makes employers responsible for verifying that their workers are legal residents and provides for fines if companies knowingly hire illegal aliens. Before the law, employers faced no sanctions for hiring illegal aliens.

 Here are excerpts of remarks at a news conference Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, on the results of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the downing of an Iranian jetliner by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>: `` It's important to bear in mind that this ship was engaged in combat with Iranian Boghammers -LRB- armed speedboats -RRB-. There had been reports of sounds of metal hitting the side of the ship, which we assumed and still assume today were bullets from the Boghammer. The ship had ... to turn a 30-degree turn. This turn took place just at the crucial decision point, so it was heeling over at about a 32-degree angle. `` Things were falling in the <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Combat Information Center -RRB-, lights were flickering, and in the background, guns were booming. I dare say it would be hard to even have this press conference under those conditions, much less reach crucial decisions on a number of targets during a very short timeframe. Nonetheless, the investigators found that the captain acted prudently on the basis of the information available to him. Both Admiral <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and I and General -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> -LRB- head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- concurred in that judgment.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>: `` An examination of the events on 3 July leads quickly to the conclusion that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must share the responsibility of the tragedy, and the investigation so found. By any measure, it was unconscionable to ignore the repeated warnings of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to permit an airliner to take off from a joint military-civilian airfield and fly directly into the midst of the ongoing surface action in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, which the Iranians themselves had initiated. `` The tragic events of July 3rd did not occur in a vacuum, as the Secretary explained to you. They happened in an area where 36-37 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors on board USS Stark had been killed by an air attack in May 1987, and where our military has been tested by fire time and again over the last year. The actions of Captain -LRB- Will -RRB- <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew must be judged in that context ... `` During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was airborne, Captain <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> team were conducting a surface action, tracking a multitude of contacts, coordinating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> units, and trying to sort out friend from foe with spotty information. He had a genuine dilemma ... `` The villains of the piece were six significant problems which plagued the captain and which he could not control or discount. <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was engaged in intense surface action with Iranian gunboats. The unidentified, assumed hostile contact had taken off from an airfield used by military aircraft. `` The flight was heading directly at <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, and its range was relentlessly closing. The unknown aircraft radiated no definitive radar emissions. Seven Vincennes warnings went unacknowledged and unanswered. The compression of time gave him an extremely short decision window, less than five minutes. `` It was only prudent for Captain <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to assume that the contact was related to his engagement with the Iranian boats until proven otherwise. The proof never came. Given the time available, the commanding officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect his ship and crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies _ or ambiguities ... `` Admiral <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>'s investigation also revealed that mistakes were made on board <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> that day. That, in itself, is not surprising to anyone who understands the stress of hostile action in a life-or-death situation. No military combat operation is flawless, even when there is a successful outcome ... `` Our early <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> briefings of the accident were based on information received from the ship shortly after the action, some of which were found by the investigation to be incorrect ... `` Questions have been raised about the ship's initial report that the aircraft was outside of the air corridor. The report was wrong. ... Perhaps the most puzzling mistake was the ultimate call of Flight 655 as descending instead of climbing ... `` In fact, the investigation concluded that the time between the initial report of decreasing altitude and the decision to fire was in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 seconds. It is impossible to say with assurance how those two inputs bore on the commanding officer's final decision. But it is important to keep in mind that the C.O. had this information for only 20 to 30 seconds and that during this interval he was involved in other things, as well as the preparations to fire ... `` Singly, the errors or mistakes were not crucial to the fateful decision. Even cumulatively, they do not appear to change the picture in a decisive way. The commanding officer never received the clear evidence that he felt he needed to establish that the Iranian aircraft had not come to participate in the ongoing surface action ... `` I believe that given the operating environment, Captain <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the defense of his ship and crew. Q: What did the crew of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> do right? <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>: `` Well, the question is not whether mistakes were made. Mistakes are made in virtually every combat situation. The question is whether the mistakes were made through negligence, or whether there is culpability. And the determination is that, no, these mistakes were not due to negligence or culpability.'' Q: So the equipment itself and the procedures did contribute to the errors made? <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>: `` No, the equipment functioned as designed. We can not find any errors in the equipment. ... And we're taking this experience, and trying to make some improvements that will make it easier for people to read the display and to communicate with each other. Once again, who knows whether these would have been critical elements. It does not seem to me that they are critical elements at all.''

 A younger brother of the Soviet-backed leader of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, says he broke with his brother because he imposed an `` infamous regime'' on the Afghan people by force of arms. `` He is not being supported by anyone so far as the Afghans are concerned,'' <PERSON> Sediqullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> told reporters Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only support he has is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He has tried to impose his regime by way of bayonets.'' The defection of <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Soraya </PERSON>, and their two young sons is a propaganda coup for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has provided Stinger missiles and other weapons to guerrillas who are at war with the Afghan and Soviet armies. <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON>, 37, who had worked for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government as a banker, broke with his brother several years ago and, after serving some months in prison, fled with his family to the mountains last winter. They crossed into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> last month and arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week where they were granted refuge immediately and given the protection of bodyguards. <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said the escape was arranged by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, leader of one of the factions at war with his brother's forces, and that they had to change getaway cars seven times and houses three times on their way from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>'s mountain hideaway. `` We were constantly under surveillance and they were following us,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said. Her bearded husband nodded his concurrence. <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> denounced his brother as `` mentally deranged and the sadist type.'' He said the government's strength is waning and its morale is very low. The Soviets are in the midst of withdrawing their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> where they had backed the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in an 8 -LCB- - year war with the rebels Once the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is gone, <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said, the government will fall. `` He has tried to impose his regime by way of bayonets,'' <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said of his brother. The rebels `` are the true fighters and defenders of our country.'' <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said he expected the Soviets to try to rescue elements of the pro-Moscow government by arranging a coalition with other Afghan forces. He said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> might be given haven in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or another communist country. Asked about the Afghan president's claims that his government can survive without the support of Soviet troops, <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said: `` Sheer lies.'' There are two younger brothers. Tradition binds them to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> even if they disagree with him, <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said. He said the two brothers were trained in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and are working for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. He said he broke with tradition. Mrs. <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> offered assurances that the rebels were not the sort of fundamentalists who rule neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` This is something the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people would repel and repudiate,'' she said. <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON>, meanwhile, paid tribute to President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who perished in an airplane crash Wednesday, as a staunch supporter of the rebels. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons are funneled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to the rebels, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has taken in millions of Afghan refugees. Referring to reports of a bomb exploding aboard the presidential plane, <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said, `` This makes one wonder whether this was arranged by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in order to muddy up the situation so they could take advantage of it for some ulterior motive.'' He added through an interpreter: `` This could have possibly been one of the Soviets' intrigues and tricks. Simply, they realized by trying some diplomatic maneuvers they could not move away Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> from his support of the resistance so they decided this could be the last remedy.'' Asked if he had evidence to support the allegation, <PERSON> Rahi </PERSON> said: `` We have no evidence. We simply are thinking that because the Soviets had given <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> warning many, many times that they will take proper action in due course, if necessary.''

<TEXT>
 The Centers for Disease Control disputes a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that the number of Americans infected with the deadly AIDS virus is actually twice the official estimate. In a study released Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that up to 3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate that is far above the calculation by <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, the primary federal agency monitoring the spread of AIDS. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> mathematician, said his study uses `` realistic'' assumptions not used by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> and, as a result, his estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS. `` The actual number of people carrying the HIV virus in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- at the end of 1987 -RRB- was not the 900,000 to 1.4 million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice that number,'' the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> report said. `` There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close to 2.4 million,'' the report said. Dr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, chief of a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> branch studying the spread of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however. In a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said he and his staff reviewed the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> study and the methods used and said, `` We do not feel a change in our data is appropriate.'' He said that for the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> model to be correct, about 2 percent of the young adult population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to be infected with HIV. Yet, he said, `` their figures are inconsistently high within segments of populations for which there are test results.'' <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent _ 0.2 percent to 0.66 percent _ among young adults. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> admitted, `` We're all in a guessing game'' when it comes to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus. Nonetheless, he said he believed the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> method is a more realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> may be right and we may be wrong,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. `` Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not know. ... The main conclusion is that we can not be complacent about this disease.'' The study by <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a privately financed public policy research organization with headquarters in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, used basic <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> data on the number of AIDS cases. But <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> used different computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV virus, is the end stage of the disease and may not develop for years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected person can spread the virus before developing AIDS. For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic. HIV infection is determined by a blood test which identifies antibodies in blood serum. A person with such antibodies is known as seropositive. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> study also estimated that the number of heterosexuals infected by the virus may be three times higher than <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. The <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> study estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and 500,000 are those who do not use drugs. `` There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,'' said <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. `` A breakout into the non-monogamous population is unavoidable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that the AIDS virus has infected only 80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population. The <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals infected are `` mainstream'' population members. `` They are not poor, and they are not IV drug users,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` But they are nonetheless carriers of the virus and, through their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the disease to others of their same class.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Quayle's Military Record Dominates Campaign Following GOP
Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Tops prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The military record of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dominated the campaign as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic tickets launched road shows on the final stretch to the November election, the political conventions now just a memory of balloons and patriotic music. Despite the controversy over whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used family influence to get into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and duck combat in the Vietnam War, the Republican ticket led by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rode the crest of publicity from the just-ended GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> into a dead heat in the polls against Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. A CNN-USA Today poll released Friday of 842 registered voters put the race at 45 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> to 44 percent for Dukakis-Bentsen. The spreads for the survey conducted Thursday night were within the poll's 4 percentage point margin of error. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> planned joint appearances today in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were scheduled to visit the LBJ Ranch outside <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The Republican standard bearers were buoyed Friday by a supportive crowd in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where boos and hoots of `` b-o-r-i-n-g'' greeted reporters' questions about the Guard issue at an outdoor news conference. The conservative 41-year-old, two-term <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator acknowledged that a family friend made calls on his behalf after he expressed interest in joining the Guard in 1969, but he insisted: `` I got in fairly.'' `` You're going to be surprised at how outraged people and families that identify with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are going to be towards these accusations,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. According to an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll released Friday, 63 percent of 613 registered voters contacted Thursday night said the fact that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at a time when others faced possible service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should not be a campaign issue. Twenty-three percent said it should be a minor issue and 11 percent a major issue. But if it turns out that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used family influence to get into the Guard, the poll results changed, with 23 percent saying it should be a major issue, 27 percent a minor issue and 47 percent saying it should not be a campaign issue. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he turned to his parents for advice during his senior year in college as he faced the loss of college deferment from the draft following graduation. The family discussed the matter with <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, a former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> who worked for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s grandfather at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, adding, `` I would assume that calls would be made.'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> has said he contacted the Guard on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at the rally, calling him `` a young man of vision, of character.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took separate campaign trails before meeting up in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for a fund-raising event Friday night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, took an indirect shot at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, telling a rally in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.: `` The test of strong presidential leadership is strength, the quality of the people you select to serve with you.'' On a day that saw him in rural <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention address Thursday night `` was n't a bad speech actually,'' but he criticized it for what it did not discuss. `` He talked a lot about missions but I must have missed a page,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who did not watch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech but reviewed its text. `` There was nothing in there about the two biggest economic challenges we face in this country,'' he said. `` We did n't hear a word from the Republicans on the budget deficit or the trade deficit last night or this week. And we know why. They do n't know how to deal with it. They do n't know what to do with it. That's why we're going to have a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president and vice president.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, meanwhile, stayed on home turf in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he criticized the Republican National Convention as a `` Mardi Gras for the Moral Majority'' that ignored the concerns of working people. Like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention address did not deal with `` how the Republicans are going to face some of the real problems'' of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including trade and budget deficits. `` Let's face some facts,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` What we saw was the Republicans putting on a convention for the Far Right. They had a Mardi Gras for the Moral Majority.'' `` The hard right drove the Republican agenda,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` There was no reaching out for the center as we have done in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> confirmed a report in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that his blind trust invested in his son's business after being steered there by the senator. He said he reported the investment, even though he did n't have to do so. He said his wife's position as a trustee on a mutual fund affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the blind trust.

<HEAD>Indians To March to Reagan's Ranch To Protest `Primitive

<TEXT>
 American Indians are going ahead with a march to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch to protest his remarks during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit about Indians' `` primitive lifestyle,'' despite <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> assurances that the president will meet with them in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The American <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that arrangements were being made for such a meeting. The Indians, who already had planned today's demonstration, said they would proceed with it because they had made a commitment and people were traveling distances to participate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in May, `` Maybe we made a mistake in trying to maintain Indian cultures. Maybe we should not have humored them in wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle.'' The president also suggested that perhaps the government should have told the Indians, `` No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us.'' American Indians were made full citizens by an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1924. The president's remarks were greeted with outrage by many Indian leaders. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would meet with them `` at any time,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> said he failed to respond to letters and telephone calls from them. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> who said she used only the name <PERSON> Pilula </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> telephoned the group Thursday after plans for the demonstration had been announced. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> spoke with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group, and said that a letter would follow, <PERSON> Pilula </PERSON> said. Neither <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> could be reached for comment Friday afternoon. <PERSON> Pilula </PERSON> said she assumed <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s call was prompted by the announcement of the demonstration, as `` he would not have had any other reason to call us.'' `` We did let him know that we would go ahead,'' she said. Deputy White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said presidential aides would meet with the Indians soon, probably while the president is vacationing at his ranch, to arrange a meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> after the president returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 6. `` During his administration, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has never met with Indian leaders,'' the group said in a statement. `` The remarks he made in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were his first reference to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in eight years.'' The group said more than 200 American Indians were expected to rally at <ORGANIZATION> Refugio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> and then walk to the gate of the president's ranch 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The Reagans arrived at the ranch Tuesday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where the president addressed the Republican National Convention. They will go to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> next Tuesday for a five-day stay. On the way to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the president will stop at the Marine Operations Building of the Port of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to sign a landmark bill designed to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficits in world trade. The president already has indicated that he would sign the bill, and Tuesday is the deadline for him to do so. The Long Beach setting was chosen for the ceremony because of the port's role in overseas trade. The bill would authorize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators to reach agreements in the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of international trade and talks and would streamline the government system of import curbs, designed to protect American business and retaliate against trade violations.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a defendant in the Iran-Contra case, lost a bid to have criminal charges dismissed on the grounds that his congressional testimony was used against him improperly by prosecutors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Friday denied a motion to dismiss the charges against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> that accuse him of conspiring to ship arms illegally to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and concealing the covert operation. However, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> ordered independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to submit by Sept. 23 detailed documentation to show his evidence against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was obtained independently of testimony the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent gave to the House-Senate committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 51, who operated under the pseudonym <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> when he was the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, testified before the committees under a grant of `` use immunity.'' That meant that prosecutors can not use his congressional testimony against him in the criminal case and can not obtain evidence based on leads provided by the immunized testimony. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> directed prosecutors to turn over to the court a list of all <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> witnesses who were interviewed after <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> gave his congressional testimony and the basis for the discussion. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has denied defense contentions that he relied on congressional testimony as a source of evidence in the case. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is accused of conspiring to ship arms to the Contras, who oppose <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, in defiance of a congressional ban on such aid. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> also is charged with lying to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the presidential commission headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. The judge, meanwhile, also ordered <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> to comply with the provisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act, refusing to declare unconstitutional the statute that requires defendants to notify the court of any plans to reveal government secrets at trial.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today with running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the man <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> increasingly talks about as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defends his choice to fill the Republican ticket. `` Is n't it great to have a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for the vice presidency whose qualifications have never been questioned by anyone?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked rhetorically Friday evening at a rally in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, before he flew here. `` The true test of leadership is to be able to make the big decisions, to choose the best people, and to inspire confidence in government,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a crowd of about 2,000 people. `` That's the test of true leadership. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been using lines similar to those since <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate, a selection that was followed quickly by questions about whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to step in as president and whether he used family influence to get into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 to duck combat duty in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared together Friday night at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> fund-raiser and were traveling today to the LBJ Ranch outside <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was to stop in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on his way home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The Walnut Ridge stop was the end of a <LOCATION> Dukakis </LOCATION> whistle stop train swing Friday through rural <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. He drew large crowds at all four depots he visited and was joined at each by numerous elected officials. `` Today we begin that journey to the future,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the depot rallies. `` And we begin it in the style of another great Democratic president, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>,'' he said at Walnut Ridge. While he indirectly criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and the senator's credentials, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aggressively attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, which the Democrat said was `` missing a page'' because it failed to address how a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency would deal with the budget and trade deficits `` Nowhere in it was there a word about the two most important economic challenges that will face the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech. `` The first is eight years of running up budget deficits that have added more to the national debt than all of the presidents from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> combined. And the second was a record trade deficit.'' At his second stop Friday, in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or other Republicans failed to mention the deficits during their convention because `` they do n't know how to deal with it.'' He labeled attacks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans on him the sign of a `` losing campaign.'' `` I do n't think that you can go to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and seek their support for the presidency if you spend 80 and 90 percent of your time cutting up the other guy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The Duke Express'' traveled through the heartland the day after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted the Republican presidential nomination. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor at each of the rallies mentioned his state's unemployment rate has been about 3 percent for several years while the jobless rates in each of the towns he visited was near 10 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies that, he said, fueled prosperity in some regions but ignored and exacerbated economic distress in others. `` They may be satisfied, but we are n't,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We can do a lot better.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly mentioned the deficits, a lack of affordable housing, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal and the stewardship of former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He said Republicans ducked those issues at their convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led the crowds in the refrain `` not a single word from the Republicans'' after mentioning each of those issues. The candidate drew laughs from reporters in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> when he joked about criticism from Republicans that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, show too much affection in public. `` It's true that Democrats sleep in double beds and Republicans prefer twins,'' he said. `` That's why there are more Democrats.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, meanwhile, campaigning across his home state, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention address did n't deal with `` how the Republicans are going to face some of the real problems'' of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. For example, he said, `` If you're worried about health care for the elderly or for children, we did n't hear any of the specifics about how those concerns are going to be met.'' `` Let's face some facts. What we saw was the Republicans putting on a convention for the Far Right,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` They had a Mardi Gras for the Moral Majority.''

 South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegates ended a second day of talks Saturday but failed to make major progress on clearing the way for full-scale talks on a non-aggression pact and sharing the Olympic Games. They agreed to a third meeting Monday. The two sides appeared far apart on all main issues as lawmakers from each side met in the South Korean pavilion at the truce site straddling the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. On Friday, delegates met in the North Korean pavilion. The five-member delegations shook hands and cracked jokes before beginning negotiations, but observers described the mood as guarded. Chief South Korean delegate Park Joon-kyu, in an opening speech, offered a number of minor concessions on the terms for holding joint parliamentary talks. The changes were basically rewordings of proposals and the South did not revise its main positions. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s delegates said the South was making discussions more complex without making progress. `` There is nothing new in your proposal,'' said chief North Korean delegate <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>. The North Korean delegation continued to press for full-scale parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact and allowing the North to co-host the Olympic Games that begin Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> showed no willingness to back down on its position that the only solution for the Olympics was for the North to participate in the Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but that co-hosting was impossible. The meeting on Friday also ended with no progress. Before the sides met, <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said he was optimistic an agreement could be negotiated, but after the working meeting, he rated chances for holding full talks at `` 50-50.'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said he needs `` a little bit of glasnost'' _ using Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s catchword for openness _ from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before agreeing to full talks on easing their 40-year rivalry. The Korean peninsula was divided north and south at the end of World War II in 1945. The nations technically are still at war since no peace treaty was signed after the Korean War of 1950-53. North Korean has called for a joint meeting of the two countries' parliaments, involving nearly 1,000 lawmakers, to discuss the Olympics and a non-aggression pact. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sought to call a `` representative meeting'' of 20 lawmakers from each side, whose main business would be to fix the agenda and work out other details for full talks. The North Koreans also proposed that both legislatures make a joint declaration of non-aggression, bypassing their governments. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> maintains that military matters must be handled by the executive branches of the two governments. Park said the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> are trying to avoid dealing with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, and get 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops withdrawn from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Chief North Korean delegate <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON> reinterated his country's demand to share in the Olympics. He said the event `` is not a simple sports game but a serious political problem which will decide the destiny of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said the only solution was for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to participate in the Games. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would keep the door open for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s participation, but noted the deadline for entries is Sept. 2. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is demanding to be a o-host at the Olympics to stave off a major political defeat. Both sides claim to be the sole legitimate government of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sees its selection to be host of the Olympics as international recognition of its claim. The International Olympic Committee says <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can not be a co-host because the Games are awarded to a single city. South Korean authorities say <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may use terrorism to try to disrupt the Olympics. Sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 1970s failed to make progress on easing hostilities. The last talks collapsed in January 1986 when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> pulled out to protest annual South Korean-U.S. military exercises.

 Police say they arrested a man who admitted setting 62 fires in three years _ an arson record. No one was injured in the fires, which caused an estimated $ 15 million damage. The 36-year-old man told investigators he used paper and a lighter to start the fires, always on weekends. `` To us, it seems that the man had a need to fill up his weekends with excitement,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Bjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Haneborg </PERSON> said Friday. The man was not identified in keeping with <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> police regulations.

<HEAD>Spending on Banquets, Luxuries Goes Unchecked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government offices continue to waste money on lavish banquets, imported cars and luxury gifts in defiance of government austerity orders, an official daily said today. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, quoting earlier press reports, said consumer spending by government organizations totaled $ 10 billion during the first seven months of the year, up 19.8 percent from the same period in 1987. The increase came despite orders that government offices reduce spending on consumer items by 20 percent this year. The report said the amount spent on feasting and luxury items this year is already more than the total year's budget for education and urban construction. According to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, restaurants in large hotels earn 60 percent to 70 percent of their income from offices using public funds for banquets. One dinner at an expensive hotel can cost the same as a factory worker's monthly salary. The report cited sharp increases in purchases of imported vehicles, color televisions, motorcycles, air conditioners, sofas and carpets despite a government freeze on buying such items. Government offices are also spending large amounts on expensive `` gifts'' such as quartz clocks, leather suitcases and cosmetics, mainly to gain access to hard-to-get goods and services, the report said. The Communist Party this week outlined a five-year economic reform package that said one top goal for 1989 was to reduce purchasing power of government organizations while countering waste and extravagance in the party and bureaucracy.

<TEXT>
 Nurses at six private hospitals rejected Friday by a 2-1 margin a tentative contract that would have boosted their pay 20 percent over three years and halted a 2 -LCB- - week-old strike that closed some emergency rooms About 65 percent of the 2,200 striking nurses voted on the offer, said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The strike is growing stronger, which is unusual,'' she said. The nurses' negotiating team had recommended the contract, but not unanimously, according to the union, which had sought a bigger pay raise. A spokesman for Affiliated Hospitals, representing the six struck hospitals, criticized the rejection as `` unreasonable and totally unjustified.'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the hospitals' chief negotiator, said the offer not only would have made the nurses among the highest paid in the nation but also exceeded the union's settlements with other hospitals in the area. Responded <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>: `` They're also paying lower than any other hospitals in the area.'' The agreement was reached early Thursday after negotiators sat through two consecutive, 17-hour bargaining sessions. The pact called for raises of 7.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 6 percent over three years, bringing salary for top nurses on the night shift to about $ 50,000. The union had originally raises of sought 11 percent and 10 percent over two years. `` A lot of people out here are disappointed,'' nurse <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> said Thursday of the tentative agreement. `` It's a slap in the face, and I do n't think I'm going to vote for it.'' The hospitals affected by the strike are <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, Children's, <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In addition to the nurses, 1,700 hospital service workers honoring the strike have stayed off the job. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, board president of the Affiliated Hospitals, acknowledged that the hospitals lost patients during the strike, but he could not provide numbers or an estimate of how much the strike cost. But <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said income for the hospitals was 50 percent below normal and that the institutions were further hurt financially by paying up to $ 56 an hour to substitute nurses from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It was just an economic nightmare for them,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It was just a lot of red tape and a lot of money for them.''

. <LOCATION> BELFAST </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A land mine destroyed a military bus carrying <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers to their barracks Friday night, killing seven troopers and injuring 29 others, police said. The military bus, which bore no markings, was taking 38 soldiers to their barracks at <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, following their leaves in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters at <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> The vehicle detonated the mine nine miles from the soldiers' barracks, on the road between <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ballygawley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION> <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s centrist <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who lives near the scene of the blast, described the attack as `` a terrible slaughter.'' <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON>, who went to the scene with other local people, said: `` The bus was a mess of mangled metal. It was a miracle anyone got out of it alive. The faces of the injured were terribly cut and bleeding.'' A press officer at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters said a report in the initial confusion at the scene of the blast that the final death toll could mount to at least 13 could now be discounted. No one claimed responsibility, but police suspected guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The army spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity, in keeping with British practice. Police and army units rushed in to seal off the area and search for the killers, while ambulances took the casualties to <ORGANIZATION> Tyrone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a province where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, and unite it with the Catholic Irish Republic. Police blamed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas for two other bombings Friday. One injured three police officers and the other damaged <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s newest luxury hotel. Also on Friday, funerals were held for a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed last week in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and for a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> grocer shot to death Wednesday in his <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> store. The three police officers were wounded when they responded to a ringing burglary alarm early Friday at a gas station in <LOCATION> Lisnaskea </LOCATION>, 62 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Officials said one of the officers, a 26-year-old woman, lost an eye and remained hospitalized. Her two male colleagues were treated for cuts and released. Guests and staff of the Mourne Country Hotel in <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> were evacuated at 2:30 a.m. after three warning calls to a <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> hospital and the Samaritans charity organization, police said. A car bomb exploded outside minutes later, causing extensive damage to the hotel's kitchen area but no casualties. `` There was only a few guests. We were lucky in that,'' said an employee, who spoke with the condition he not be identified. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> message to a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> radio station called the hotel near the border with the Irish republic `` a meeting place for members of the security forces and informers'' and claimed responsibility for that bombing and the one in <LOCATION> Lisnaskea </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Knighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 mourners attended the funeral of Warrant Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heakin </PERSON>, 38, who was killed by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen Aug. 12 in the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION> as he stopped his car for a traffic light. He was stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but his license plate identified him as a British soldier. At the parish church of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, his cousin, the Rev. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Heakin </PERSON>, prayed that `` the forces of evil and terrorism will never ever have the last word in our world and that peace and justice will prevail.'' In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, thousands of people lined the streets to observe a funeral procession for <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Otley </PERSON>, 44, a grocer shot to death by masked gunmen Wednesday in his shop in the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Shankill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> area of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility Wednesday. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> asserted responsibility and claimed <PERSON> Otley </PERSON> belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary organization. <PERSON> Otley </PERSON> stood trial in 1985 on charges of membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and bombing a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> social club, but was released when a government informer withdrew his evidence.

 Newly crowned presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kicked off his general election campaign in the heart of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but the star-spangled kickoff rally was marred by running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s continuing defense of his military record. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came to the senator's hometown to launch their campaign, and a crowd of some 8,000 to 10,000 flag-waving and cheering townspeople greeted them. But not long after the pair delivered standard campaign-style speeches, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was off to the side of the <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> lawn, answering reporters' questions <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in a give-and-take session that had been set up by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> organization and piped to the crowd by loudspeaker system, combatively defended his 1969 decision to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the height of the Vietnam War. Commenting on persistent reports that he used family connections to win a spot on a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit roster, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I can assure you that I asked no one to break any rules, and that I broke no rules at all.'' `` I was on active duty for six months,'' he said. `` I could have been called to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as many <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> units were, and if I had been called, I would have gone.'' Members of the crowd, witnessing an extraordinary confrontation between a high-profile public figure and reporters, booed lustily when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked repeatedly about his motives for joining the Guard. During his speech to the crowd here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought he would beat historical odds against vice presidents seeking the presidency. He said that at the end of Thursday night's acceptance speech, `` I just could n't help but think that old <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> was up there giving me the high-five sign,'' he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> was the last vice president to win the top job, and that was over 150 years ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared together in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> earlier Friday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The newly minted ticket got well wishes from party figures before flying to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> continued to poke fun at the uproar surrounding reports of his National Guard involvement during his appearance before the RNC. `` <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife -RRB- and I are just getting used to how we are supposed to conduct ourselves on the campaign trail,'' he said. The 41-year old senator strode to the podium following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech and said, `` I think I now know how to introduce myself. He came to attention, snapped his heels together and said: `` Name: <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' `` Rank: sergeant.'' `` Serial number: 303 50 4096.'' `` Status: In the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> six years and proud of it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> were in high spirits the morning after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention, and both seemed eager to proceed with what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called `` the countdown phase.'' The pair scheduled campaign trips over the next two days to <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and to the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. In a brief talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders before leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the convention amounted to another `` shifting of gears'' in the campaign, and said that now `` we're coming to the beginning of the end I'm convinced we're going to win.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought the convention had helped him get his message to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and `` beyond the filters'' that obscure his points. He evidently was referring to fact that his speech was broadcast live. He said his basic campaign message will be constituted in part by emphasis on maintaining world peace and security and the other half will focus on `` enlarging the prosperity so that everyone benefits.'' `` We have a good message, it's an upbeat message,'' he said. Saying most elections hinge on the pocketbook issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the coming campaign gauge `` the innate optimism aand pessimism of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` we have not yet captivated'' the kinds of public opinion poll numbers that would be reflected by a belief by people that they're better off than they were eight years ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saluted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` that young spirit'' who relates to the `` changing decade we're moving into.''

 If at first you do n't succeed in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, try the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. That's what singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> did. After unsuccessfully seeking to be a passenger on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle, he has asked the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a ride aboard its Mir space station, an industry magazine reported Friday. Aviation Week & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> had requested transportation to Mir aboard one of the Soyuz spaceships that regularly carry crews to and from the orbiting station. `` The Soviets responded with two conditions,'' the magazine said. `` They told <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> they would charge him $ 10 million for the ride and that he had to get permission from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took its customary cautious approach, advising <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> it was taking ` no position' on the matter _ effectively putting it back into the hands of the Soviets.'' The magazine quoted an unidentified American official as saying, `` We very carefully did not endorse his going, but at the same time we ca n't prevent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens from going to exotic places.'' <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has been a guest of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> at several space shuttle launches and has asked several times over the years for a shuttle ride, saying he wanted to compose in orbit a song about space.

<HEAD>State Turned Down Feds' Elite Anti-Terror Squad In Hostage Ordeal</HEAD>

 The federal government says it offered state authorities the use of an elite anti-terrorist squad after two bank robbers set off on a murderous highway rampage, but the crack unit was never used. A young woman, a 15-year-old boy and a police officer died during the 54-hour ordeal that began with a bank robbery, escalated into a bus hijacking and ended with a bloody gunfight on a highway near <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Criticism of the state government's handling of the case heightened considerably on Friday, one day after two men and a woman were arrested. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the country's elite GSG-9 anti-terrorist force was offered to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> state officials to help end the crisis. Instead, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> officials dispatched a police commando unit. The commandos rammed the getaway car, and a gun battle ensued that resulted in the death of one of two hostages. Asked if the federal government regrets that the GSG-9 was not used, <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> replied only: `` The legal situation in which the states have responsibility for police deployments must be respected.'' The GSG-9 rescued 86 passengers held by terrorists on a <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> airliner on Oct. 13, 1977 at <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. Some politicians criticized <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> officials for not making use of the GSG-9, which stands for Grenzschutzgruppe-Unit 9, or Federal Border Guard Troops-Unit 9. State officials defended their actions during the ordeal, which began Tuesday when two men robbed a bank in the northwestern town of <LOCATION> Gladbeck </LOCATION>. Authorities gave them a getaway car, and they fled with two hostages. The gunmen surfaced Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, 125 miles to the northeast, where they seized a bus with about 30 people aboard. Most of the ordeal occurred in <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> state, but the gunmen also drove the bus across the border into the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, then returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a car provided by Dutch authorities. A federal official, Education Minister <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> - <LOCATION> Westphalia </LOCATION> Interior Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnoor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, interior minister for the city of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, should resign `` It is totally unconceivable why actions were not taken sooner -LRB- to stop the bandits -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Schnoor </PERSON> said he takes `` political responsibility'' for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> law officials' handling of the crisis, but he rejected allegations they bungled the job. Meanwhile, officials said they are certain that hostage <PERSON> Silke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischof </PERSON>, 18, was killed by one of the bank robbers and not by police during Thursday's shootout. Police identified the gunmen as <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Degowski </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roesner </PERSON>, 31, and their alleged female accomplice as <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeblich </PERSON>, 34. A second hostage in the getaway car, identified by the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> as 18-year-old <PERSON> Ines </PERSON> <PERSON> Voitelle </PERSON>, was grazed by a bullet on the back while gunman <PERSON> Roesner </PERSON> was shot in the thigh during the police shootout. An Italian teen-ager, <PERSON> Emanuele </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgi </PERSON>, was shot to death Wednesday night after the busload of hostages stopped at a highway rest area near <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Abendpost </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said the 15-year-old was killed by the gunmen while trying to protect his little sister from them. A police officer also died in a car crash while pursuing the bandits toward the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. All the hostages but Ms. <PERSON> Bischof </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Voitelle </PERSON> either escaped or were freed after the bus arrived in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 A federal jury assessed the flamboyant Hunt brothers more than $ 130 million in damages Saturday after finding that they had conspired to corner the world silver market in the late 1970s. The jury said the three Hunt brothers and two other defendants had ruined the investments of the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company, <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, by sending the price of silver to artificial heights. All of the Hunts but one _ <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, 56, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> _ also were found to have engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the silver market. Since the case is a civil one, there would be no criminal penalties attached to the finding. The verdict was a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, which lost millions in the volatile silver market, and a setback for the three sons of the late <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman H.L. Hunt. The jury found that <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fustok </PERSON> had participated in the conspiracy with the three <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers.
