<HEAD>Researchers Find Census Thought Destroyed by Stalin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet demographer was quoted as saying Wednesday that researchers have found the results of a 1937 census thought to have been destroyed by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to hide millions of deaths caused by his policies. Demographer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolts </PERSON> said the census showed a population of 162 million, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, in a story about the census published in December, said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> claimed a population in 1937 of 170 million even though statistics could not confirm it. <PERSON> Tolts </PERSON> did not say where the census results were found, and said it was too early to use its figures to estimate how many people died in the purges, collectivization of agriculture and forced industrialization <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed in the 1930s. Current Soviet reference books put the population at 163 million for 1917, the year of the revolution that brought the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> to power. The current population is 284 million. <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> blamed many of the deaths on a famine forced upon rural residents by government grain requisitions, but <PERSON> Tolts </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressive policies also apparently were to blame He said the population of the <LOCATION> Saratov </LOCATION> region on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> declined by 20 percent between 1927 and 1937, and the population of the Kursk region south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> declined by 14 percent in the same period. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1934 that the Soviet population the previous year was 168 million, although census officials put the figure at 165.7 million and one scientist put it as low as 158 million.

 A black man walking home from his job at a fast-food restaurant was attacked early Wednesday by six white men who shouted racial slurs as they pummelled him with sticks and a baseball bat, police said. The victim, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, took refuge in a pizza parlor, where the owners defended him against the gang and were themselves later harassed and assaulted, according to police. Three whites were arrested, and police were seeking three others. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, 24, was treated for bruises at a hospital and released. He said the assault, which occurred on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, reminded him of the attack by a dozen white youths on three blacks in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> in December 1986. In that highly publicized case, one of the black men died when he was hit by a car while trying to escape. Three white teens were convicted of manslaughter last December. `` It's the same incident, racial,'' said <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, who was treated for contusions at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was minding my own business. I just get jumped for no reason.'' A short time after the attack, officers arrested <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessoye </PERSON>, 19; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 18; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kish </PERSON>, 20, all of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. They were charged with second-degree assault, aggravated harassment, criminal possession of a deadly instrument and possession of a controlled substance, marijuana. <PERSON> Dessoye </PERSON> was also charged with driving while intoxicated. `` <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> was the first thing I thought of,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamartina </PERSON>, one of the owners of the Cafe DiSicilia pizzeria, who aided <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>. `` It was n't right. This guy was doing nothing wrong.'' <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, a cook at a Burger King restaurant, said he was walking home through a mostly white section of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at about 12:20 a.m. when a car slowed down and the occupants began harassing him. `` They were calling me racial names _ nigger, <PERSON> blackie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said. The men left their car and began beating him on the arm with sticks and a baseball bat, chasing him down the street. When <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> fled into the pizzeria, `` he was nervous; his arm was messed up,'' <PERSON> Lamartina </PERSON> said. `` He said he just got jumped by a carload of white guys.'' <PERSON> Lamartina </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> some ice and offered to have a worker drive him home. The group of white men appeared in front of the store, but they left after <PERSON> Lamartina </PERSON> and an employee went outside to disperse them. At about 1:20 a.m., after <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> had been taken home, the group reappeared in front of the pizza parlor and taunted <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> and the store's other owner, <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Taormina </PERSON>, calling them `` nigger lovers,'' <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> said. Both owners are white. `` One of them had a bat, and went to swing it at me, but <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> caught it,'' <PERSON> Lamartina </PERSON> recounted. `` We smacked them around a little bit, and they ran away.'' Neighbors who had witnessed the altercation called police, as did <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> when he got home. A short time later, officers pulled over a red car and arrested <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessoye </PERSON>, 19, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kish </PERSON>, 20, all of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. They were identified by <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taormina </PERSON> as the assailants. The three men were charged with second-degree assault, aggravated harassment, criminal possession of a deadly instrument and criminal possession of a controlled substance, marijuana. <PERSON> Dessoye </PERSON> was also charged with driving while intoxicated. All three pleaded innocent to the charges before Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. Bail was set for Dessoye at $ 5,275 and $ 2,500 for both <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kish </LOCATION>.

 A new film talent has emerged from the satirical movie `` A Handful of Dust.'' Her name is <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The movie features <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> in small but telling cameos, but it is dominated by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> as the elegant English rose, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Last </PERSON>, who drifts into a destructive affair with the young roue <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rupert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graves </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Based on <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>'s savage 1934 novel, the $ 6 million film co-stars <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilby </PERSON> -LRB- Graves' co-star last year in `` Maurice'' -RRB- as <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>'s hapless husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>. It opens in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on June 24. `` I'm very pleased, I'm afraid, about the reaction that I'm getting It's so nice to have one's work appreciated,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in an interview about her repeated raves from the British press. While reviews were mixed for the movie as a whole, critics hailed its female lead with the kind of accolades that banish anonymity forever. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> in The Standard called the actress `` the film's great find,'' adding, `` It will be criminal if British cinema does n't ... make a great star of her. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery-Massingberd </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> in The Guardian both called her `` a revelation.'' <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> in The Sunday Times found the Paris-based actress `` a singular sensation'' in a movie that has returned her in triumph to the country she left eight years ago. `` I never really thought I'd be able to work in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, so ` A Handful of Dust' was an enormous pleasure and a great privilege,'' said the 28-year-old actress, who dropped out of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speech </ORGANIZATION> and Drama after a year to move to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` I was doing a teacher training course and hated it, wanted to change and could n't,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, occasionally interrupting the interview to tend to the cries of her month-old daughter, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>. `` I was told I'd never be an actress anyway, and would never be able to play for real,'' she said. `` I thought it would be better to be totally miserable somewhere else and learn French at the same time.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, her life took a happier turn, beginning with her marriage to a French obstetrician. After drama training in French, she began getting parts in theater and in movies, and landed a role opposite the rock superstar Prince in his second movie, a bomb called `` Under the Cherry Moon.'' The film was not a financial success and was lampooned by critics. However, it enjoyed an international release. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturridge </PERSON>, the director of `` Handful of Dust'' and of the hit <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON> TV adaptation, `` Brideshead Revisited,'' saw it and cast <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>. She had studied the book at school and said she seized the chance to become part of the film. `` I was sure it was going to be great,'' she recalled, before going back to the novel to immerse herself in Lady <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>'s emotionally fatal attraction to the callow and cunning <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> `` She likes taking someone who is absolutely dreadful and turning him into this fascinating young man whom no one can understand what she sees in him,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, explaining the fascination on which the film's denouement depends: `` It makes her different, too.'' `` In the end, <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> is much worse than <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> ever thought he was, really; by then she's in too deep,'' she said. The daughter of an affluent naval officer who died when she was five, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said she was bemused by the critique of the English class system that pervades the book and the film. `` It's quite sort of endearing, really, but it is ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a graduate of the posh <ORGANIZATION> Cheltenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> `` It's like some dear old piece of furniture that you like but you think is quite the most hideous thing in the world.'' She hopes not to be typecast as aristocratic English swells, and would like to do a French film next. `` I live there and I want to work there. You have to work hard, and I really mean to work hard,'' she said. `` I've got to make sure that the revelation does n't turn out to be a disaster.''

 The commuter train zips along at 50 miles an hour. On top of a car a young man stands up and waves his arms like a bird in flight. The slightest slip could mean a fatal fall; the slightest jolt could mean contact with a 3,000-volt electrical wire overhead. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON>, 15, and hundreds of other youths from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>'s poor outlying suburbs risk their lives every day showing off their skills in what is known as train surfing. Some 150 train surfers were killed last year, 40 in the first five months of this year. The government company that runs the commuter trains has had to pay the equivalent of $ 700,000 in claims filed by the survivors of youths killed or by youths who have been injured. More than 400 young men were injured in 1987, some permanently paralyzed. `` These people are seeking new thrills, but in my opinion they're suicidal,'' said <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, spokesman for the railroad. He added that efforts to discourage the train surfers have failed. `` With the money we spent on claims, we could have repaired 10 trains,'' he said. He added that the railroad is trying to persuade judges not to validate claims in cases of train-surfing accidents. `` I've been doing this since I was 13,'' said <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON>. `` You get a feeling of freedom that is greater than any fear.'' <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON> is a grade-school dropout and works as a messenger. He declined to give his last name in an interview. Train surfers come from poor neighborhoods, and some Brazilian newspapers have speculated the young people are trying to emulate the sea surfers at wealthy beachfront districts, such as <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ipanema </LOCATION>. The newspaper accounts also have suggested the surfers ride train roofs because they ca n't afford the 15-cruzado -LRB- 8-cent -RRB- fare, or that there's no room in the crowded trains, which transport 1.2 million passengers daily. But <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, the railroad spokesman, dismissed all these arguments. `` It's strictly for the fun,'' he said. `` In the first place, you have to pay the fare to get inside the train stations. And even when it's not rush hour and there are plenty of seats, you still see these kids on top of the cars.'' The train company has assigned 200 guards a day to try to stop train surfers. But the guards are not enough to cover the commuter system's 450 miles of track and 110 stations. When they do arrest a train surfer, the penalty is a fine equivalent to $ 1 and a lecture from a government psychologist. `` The purpose is not to jail these people,'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said. `` It is to save their lives.'' Chief <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> of the police precinct of the Engenho Novo neighborhood ordered 11 train surfers jailed without bail on charges of obstructing railroad traffic. But a judge ruled that train surfing was not a crime, but rather an act of `` self-injury,'' similar to attempted suicide, and not dealt with in the Brazilian legal code. The judge reprimanded the chief for abuse of authority. `` We're not crazy, and we're not bums either,'' said train surfer <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON>, 18, an apprentice lathe operator who makes $ 70 a month, slightly more than the minimum wage. `` We're just looking for a little fun, to pass the time during the train ride.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 19, a maid, who like <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> would not tell her last name, said she sometimes rides on top of the commuter trains because the atmosphere inside the cars is `` violent,'' with frequent muggings. But she added, `` It's a lot of fun, too.'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, the railroad spokesman, said train surfers have always been a problem, but the practice reached an all-time high last year. He added that the suburb of <LOCATION> Nilopolis </LOCATION> has a `` Train Surfers Association'' with three tests for membership: 1 -RRB- Ride hanging from the outside of a window or door. 2 -RRB- Climb up a car in motion and lie on the roof. 3 -RRB- Stand on the roof of a moving car. The founder of the association, known as Rambo, was killed when he fell from a train. Another member of the group who was killed had a membership card in his pocket. It said, `` Evanil dos <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> passed his test and is authorized to hang from trains.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a political science professor with pride in his grasp of strategy, apparently misunderstood the army and may have been duped into trying to exploit what he read as dissension within it. His attempt did n't work, and the general who handed <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> the presidency in February took it back and sent him into exile. Several versions are circulating of the overthrow of <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> this week by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, who ran the ruling junta for two years after the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship ended and proclaimed himself president Monday. All focus on miscalculations by <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a civilian who was eager to assert control over the army after four months in power. Some say <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> overreached by trying to use what seemed to be a split between <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a powerful commander, to carry out a general purge of the army. Others say the dispute between <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> may itself have been a sham, and <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> walked into the trap. The army has not explained. A friend and sometime adviser to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said privately `` the high command tricked <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>,'' using his desire to control the army as a tool to overthrow him. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s escape from house arrest Sunday evening and his noisy takeover of the National Palace `` seems to have been a well-set-up sham,'' a Western diplomat said, also on condition of anonymity. No one was killed and nothing destroyed at the palace, the scene of most of the shooting Sunday night, and soldiers who allegedly were fighting one another at midnight stood together amicably on television early in the morning. About 1:30 a.m., only 55 minutes after the heaviest gunfire, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> appeared on television at the palace carrying an Uzi submachine gun. A military band played the national anthem. When he announced a military government later in the morning, also on television, he was surrounded by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and representatives of other units. The 7,000-man army appears united behind him. Later Monday, he announced promotions of officers <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> had retired or transferred, including Col. Prosper Avril to brigadier general and adjutant general of the military. Many observers believe <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who had been a military adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION>, was a key figure in the coup. Political observers still are trying to piece together how <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ended up in the National Palace and <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a small hotel in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on the other side of Hispaniola island. This is what is known: <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> tried 10 days ago to transfer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to an administrative post from command of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion stationed just behind the National Palace. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> refused. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> sided with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and dismissed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> as army chief on Friday. When <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> appeared to accept, `` <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> thought he had an opportunity'' to exert control over officers who had hampered his initiatives since he took office, a diplomat said. The portly 57-year-old professor and linguist, who has studied and lectured at some of the world's major universities, tried his own series of transfers and promotions Sunday afternoon. Within hours he was arrested and sent with his family across the border to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> admitted Tuesday he was surprised by the coup, had believed most of the military supported him and did n't understand why <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> rejoined <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who follows events in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> closely, said it appears <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> hoped to consolidate power by dominating the army as <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> did `` The <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION> were able to control the military for years by a divide, confuse and conquer approach,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION> frequently dismissed officers they distrusted, and they diluted the army's power with a private security force, the feared <ORGANIZATION> Tontons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>, fled the country Feb. 7, 1986, ending the 29-year family dictatorship, and the junta led by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> took over. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said one interpretation of the Namphy-Paul rift was that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> realized `` the <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> components of the army were stronger, so he recognized he did n't have an alternative other than to cut a deal.'' Another theory is that <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> simply gambled and lost, that a showdown with the army was inevitable and he moved when he thought his chances were best. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, a businessman, has said the general did not know soldiers would free him Sunday night. A close friend of Gen. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> put him up to transferring <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and turned on the general when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> refused to go. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He a dominant figure in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s army, which is top-heavy with officers and so factionalized that a colonel can be more powerful than a general. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s justification for returning to the palace was that <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s attempted reorganization of the army was unconstitutional, dangerously partisan and endangered democracy.

The previous record for a cello was $ 393,000 paid in 1984 by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an eminent <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cellist, for a <LOCATION> Stradivari </LOCATION> instrument known as the Bonjour. Sotheby's said several people were bidding for the <PERSON> Cholmondeley </PERSON> `` in a relaxed way.'' They said they were not surprised by the price as they had expected the cello to sell for at least $ 1 million. They said the buyer might decide at some time to disclose his or her identity. British cellist <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, younger brother of composer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, spent $ 280,000 in 1986 on a <PERSON> Stradivari </PERSON> cello and was not immediately identified as the purchaser. `` The Cholmondeley -LRB- pronounced <PERSON> Chumley </PERSON> -RRB- is so well made that it almost plays itself _ as if it had cruise control,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, the cataloguer of Wednesday's auction. The cello has a head by a different maker, <PERSON> Joannnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Florenus </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidantus </PERSON>. The instrument is just over 29 inches long and rich golden-brown in color. It belonged in the mid-19th century to the Marquess of <LOCATION> Cholmondeley </LOCATION>. It later went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was played at the <LOCATION> Stradivari </LOCATION> memorial concert in 1937 by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxman </PERSON>. `` It is a well-known instrument and has been in the hands of several collectors recently,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>.

 They came to curry <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>, not craze him. <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>, an African gray parrot that's been the <PERSON> Briere </PERSON> family pet for 11 years, took his first-ever flight Sunday afternoon while his cage was being moved outside and spent two days as a free bird. The parrot, who eschews the traditional cracker in favor of provolone cheese and bolgona, perched atop a tall tree across the street from his home after he flew the coop. <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> remained free until Tuesday. The fire department on Sunday responded by sending Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> up in a ladder truck bucket. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said as soon as he got close, <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> just squealed and flew away. The bird's quest for freedom kept family members, friends and neighbors busy as they took shifts throughout the day and night keeping track of the parrot, according a family member. <PERSON> Jeannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Briere </PERSON> said she spent the days sitting in the back yard, whistling and calling the bird until her voice started tiring. She then made a tape recording of her calls and played it over and over. Her husband, <PERSON> Fern </PERSON>, said he told her at one point that the parrot was trying to come home, but did n't know how to land. On Tuesday, the Brieres bought a large fishing net and attached it to a 10-foot pole. After tracking <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> to a neighbor's tree, they reached up and after a couple of tries, bagged the bird. <PERSON> Briere </PERSON>, with gloves on, grabbed the bird from the net. <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s first word was `` Hello.

 A falafel vendor is claiming victory in a food fight against hot dogs. The ruckus started when <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonan </PERSON>, who has sold falafel at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> street festivals for nine years, moved his sidewalk cart to a busy downtown street where hot-dog carts have long had a monopoly. The hot dog vendors complained, and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health inspectors ordered <PERSON> Bonan </PERSON> to close the business March 9. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s health code limits mobile food units to `` frankfurters only,'' they said That's because hot dogs are covered with `` a membrane that prevents pathogenic organisms from entering the food.'' <PERSON> Bonan </PERSON> claimed the code was unconstitutional, sued the state in federal court and refused to budge. Earlier this month, a health inspector and three police officers confiscated $ 100 of falafel, doused it with liquid bleach and threatened to arrest <PERSON> Bonan </PERSON> if he did n't stop. An emergency hearing was held Friday and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Smargon </PERSON> ruled in <PERSON> Bonan </PERSON>'s favor. `` Just standing up for my rights through the legal system,'' said <PERSON> Bonan </PERSON>, who vows to add two carts selling the mashed chick-pea mixture on city streets by next week. The state has 10 days to appeal. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros </PERSON>, assistant county director of environmental health, said he is worried that the falafel case will open the streets to everything from tacos to chicken wings.

 Two escaped murderers from the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> were captured in a rural field Wednesday night after a brief exchange of gunfire with state police. State police Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said nobody was injured during the exchange. He said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, 27, were taken into custody about 8:21 p.m. in a cornfield about 300 feet from a temporary command post that state police had set up in a church parking lot. The two were seen crawling through the field by several children playing kickball behind the church before Wednesday night prayer meeting. The two surrendered after their escape from the field was halted by a barbed wire fence. Both men were armed, <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had died his hair red, and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> had cut his hair. State police said neighborhood children had found two tote bags Tuesday night that were believed to have been dropped by the escapees. The bags contained bullets, clothing and hair dye. The escapees, both from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, were among eight who fled the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Eddyville </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> last Thursday. Three others have been captured. State police said they believed the two men had been staying with friends or relatives of <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s since arriving in the area Sunday. `` I anticipate some charges against local people for aiding these fugitives,'' said state police Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON>. Those still at large include another murderer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Farler </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, serving 23 years for burglary and assault, and <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, serving 37 years for kidnapping and robbery. The eight sawed their way to freedom from an upper level of Cellhouse 3. The breakout was apparently well-planned, with inmates on the cellhouse's lower level setting small, diversionary fires to distract guards. Officials in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, were investigating Wednesday whether the murder of an elderly couple in rural <LOCATION> Leatherwood </LOCATION>, a resort community on <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> about 50 miles south of the prison, was linked to the escapes. <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> and a laboratory team from the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> linked the slayings to the fugitives, but had no details.

 A plan by a back-to-nature group to hold a gathering of thousands of people in a national forest has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to place 24 additional officers on patrol.

 Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capital Wednesday for meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the leading presidential candidates and to speak to both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The prime minister and his wife, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, were in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met their helicopter near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> monument and escorted them to their hotel. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hosted a dinner for the <PERSON> Hawkes </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night and praised <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s strong ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was posing new challenges in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the two allies must face the question `` how do we meet the challenge.'' On <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is withdrawing some of its forces, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` we must keep up the pressure now that we see things are going our way.'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> paid tribute to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as a good friend of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and joined him in calling for an end to agricultural subsidies. `` It's insane to spend $ 200 billion on them,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> told a television interviewer his message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders will be <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s familiar appeal against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm subsidies that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> says are unfair competition and cause economic harm to `` a first class ally of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the best ally you've got.'' In trade, `` that first class relationship is n't reflected. We do n't like our farmers and our economy being hurt by action here which is against your own interests. ... That's my message,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` It's against the self-interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be spending the billions of dollars it is on farm supports and subsidies,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` It does n't get into the right hands. It increases the cost and price structure of this country.'' But Australians, with unsubsidized wheat and meat to export, are `` the innocent people in the middle who get caught by the subsidies cross fire between the Europeans and the Americans,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> added. The prime minister also branded as `` nonsense'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> anti-nuclear restrictions that barred American warships from visiting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and led to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s ouster from the three-cornered <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> alliance between the two <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Seventy-four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships visited <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> last year with `` no restrictions,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` We've got an alliance relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and we do n't buy the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> proposition that you can have an alliance relationship and say to your ally, ` We're allies, but I'm sorry, boys, your ships ca n't come. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> will address a meeting of the two houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and then lunch with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. An afternoon meeting was planned with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, probable <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate in the November presidential election, and the <PERSON> Hawkes </PERSON>' host at dinner later Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> also would meet <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the probable <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> planned to fly Friday to a speaking engagement at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A familiar ingredient was missing from this week's economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>: No one did any Japan-bashing. Unlike past summits when the Japanese sat quietly on the sidelines and other countries complained of surging trade deficits, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> was more like a corporate board meeting with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> an equal partner. `` Statistics talked on our behalf,'' explained <PERSON> Michihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunihiro </PERSON>, chief cabinet counselor on foreign affairs. He was referring to three inter-related developments in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy Over the last three years, the value of the yen has doubled against the dollar, making Japanese exports more expensive and American imports cheaper. Second, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has agreed it needs to develop its domestic market and thus increase its import. Most important, the island nation has promised to work for a gradual narrowing of its record trade surpluses. The performance of the Japanese economy led several summit partners to compliment Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, making his debut at the annual gatherings. `` He was very pleased,'' said Kunihiro. By fully cooperating with international efforts to coordinate economic policies, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now feels treated like an `` insider'' in the cliquish Group of Seven major industrialized democracies, he said. `` Perhaps Japanese leaders finally thought they can contribute more substantively than before. I will leave the judgment to you,'' Kunihiro said of the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, referred to the gathering as a `` trilateral'' summit that balanced the interests of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> behind it.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> expressed satisfaction that action was taken on all three of his priorities. There was a joint commitment to growth-without-inflation, a determination to fight protectionism and agreement on relieving Third World debt. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> used the summit platform to announce its waiving of $ 1 billion in debt repayments from 17 of the world's poorest countries over the next five years. Even on farm subsidies, the result was to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s liking. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had proposed ending the $ 200 billion subsidy war by the year 2000, but the final communique merely targeted reductions provided such factors as `` social concerns,'' `` food security'' and agricultural `` diversity'' are taken into account. Farmers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are a powerful political force and farm subsidies, including tariffs that restrict competition from cheaper <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods, are their life blood. Even as the summiteers gathered, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reached agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a longstanding dispute over raising quotas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and citrus products. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also signed a pact to open up Japanese laboratories to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> researchers for closer collaboration in science and technology. While not presuming to speak directly for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he was happy summit partners pledged a new dialogue with the newly industrialized nations of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. There was even speculation that the so-called `` four tigers'' might be invited as observers at future summits, and the suggestion <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might stage an Asian economic summit. `` The Japanese have a growing sense that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should play a greater role in affairs outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ... except for military activities. That is something constitutionally we have to refrain from,'' Kunihiro said. One future goal, the official said, is to help <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 122 million people mix better with the rest of the world. `` We should be better understood despite the difficult language of Japanese, and try to educate our people -LRB- in other cultures -RRB-,'' he said. This new, outgoing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was reflected in the summit briefings. Foreign journalists, including Japanese speakers, were barred from briefings for reporters from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ a tradition. But there were separate, informative and good-natured sessions in English. Kunihiro drew laughs when he sidestepped a question about vague free-trade language in the final communique. `` This is the text my boss agreed to,'' he said with a smile.

 The song of the sea is still music to the ears of five fishermen now home to family and friends after 144 days adrift in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on a disabled boat. `` We're sea dogs. The sea calls to us,'' said one, 27-year-old <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. `` The sea is the source of life for us and our families.'' The five, headed by skipper <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON>, 33, received a hero's welcome Wednesday from dozens of people including first lady <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> when they flew in from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Relatives, friends, neighbors and fellow `` pescadores'' flocked in from <LOCATION> Puntarenas </LOCATION>, their home port 95 miles away, to welcome them at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Santamaria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The engine of their 33-foot fishing vessel, the <PERSON> Cairo </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, was knocked out beyond repair during a storm Jan. 24, five days after they sailed out of <LOCATION> Puntarenas </LOCATION>, leaving them adrift in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. What was to have been an eight-day fishing trip turned into a nearly five-month quest for survival. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, his eyes moist as he hugged his wife, <PERSON> Edith </PERSON>, told reporters ships passed them twice but did not see them. A Japanese tuna boat finally ran into them about 700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on June 15 and took them to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where doctors found them all in good health. All in all, it was a 3,600-mile journey. The five said they survived by catching turtles and sharks, collecting rainwater and cooking them on wood fires they made by tearing pieces of wood from the boat. They said the pain was in the loneliness and not knowing when help would come. `` We spent months and months without seeing anyone, but we never lost our faith in God. We knew he was with us and he finally sent us this Japanese vessel,'' said crewman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, 22. <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and their two mates _ <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON>, 47, and Pastor <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, 30 _ attended Mass at a Roman Catholic church and gave thanks for their deliverance. `` Imagine! Our little boat in the middle of the ocean, directionless. The hot sun of the daytime, the darkness of the night, the stars and the cold. They were truly terrible days,'' <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> said. Once they had to go without water for four days because it did n't rain and, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said, `` There was a moment when were drinking the blood of a turtle and I looked at Pastor and he was foaming at the mouth.'' The <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> III and its crew may have broken the record for survival at sea. The Guinness Book of World Records lists the record for survival on a raft as 133 days, set by a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> man who was adrift in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> from Nov. 23, 1942, to April 5, 1943 after his ship was torpedoed.

I expect it to become law this year,'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Wednesday after the Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sent the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by voice vote The bill authorizes $ 400 million to expand testing and counseling activities for each of the next three years. Half the money would go to states and the other half would go directly to clinics, health centers and hospitals. Counseling would be required for anyone taking a test, whether the results were positive or negative. Anyone who intentionally or negligently breached the confidentiality of test results could be charged a fine of up to $ 10,000. An intentional violation could also bring up to a year in jail. The bill bans use of federal funds for counseling `` that promotes or encourages homosexual sexual activity or unsafe heterosexual sexual activity or intravenous drug abuse.'' But it also says counselors must provide the best information available on how to avoid getting or transmitting AIDS, `` provided that any informational materials used are not obscene.'' The major casualty of the many controversies stirred by the bill was a section banning private-sector discrimination against people with AIDS or the AIDS virus. The federal government already has a ban. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, called the omission unfortunate but said it would have been impossible to pass such a policy in the current political climate. Getting rid of the discrimination provision also makes it much less likely the bill will be blocked in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said, because it `` removes the biggest objection that some of the right-wingers have.'' The counseling and testing bill is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said he may attempt to restore the anti-discrimination provision on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor He called its deletion `` a terrible public health mistake'' because the most likely AIDS victims, without protection against losing their jobs, insurance or housing, would not volunteer for tests. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said he would try to build bipartisan support for the discrimination ban on the grounds that the president's commission on AIDS recently recommended precisely such a federal policy. But <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said the commission view is useless without President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s backing. `` Without it I ca n't see that members are going to be willing to vote for it, have the courage to vote for it, in an election year,'' he said. `` If the president will stand behind his commission's recommendations, we will join him in sponsoring an amendment.'' Before approving the AIDS testing bill, the committee rejected a series of amendments sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>. Among them were attempts to require testing of all prisoners, marriage license applicants and hospital admittees. <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> also failed to win approval of a requirement that people with AIDS or the AIDS virus be reported to authorities by name; the bill requires instead that cases be reported with statistical and demographic information. Another unsuccessful <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> amendment would have required doctors to notify spouses, sex partners or IV needle partners if the patient did n't notify them within a reasonable period. Members of both parties said the bill permits doctors to make such notifications but should n't require them to do so. AIDS renders the body's immune system incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.

 The drought that threatens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop production also is sending shock waves through world markets and prospects for exports, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. But it could be one of those `` good news, bad news'' situations, says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no question that the higher commodity prices we see today will likely raise the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, you have to recognize that higher prices might reduce the total quantity traded.'' In other words, one bushel of wheat selling for $ 3 is worth as much as three bushels selling for $ 1 each. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and farm officials contacted Wednesday agreed that it is too early for a realistic appraisal of the export situation. No one can be sure what this year's harvests of corn, wheat and soybeans will be, and until that is known, the global supply and price situation is mostly guesswork. The department's first overall crop production estimates of the season, including total wheat, corn and soybeans, will be released on Aug. 11. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said there `` could be a tendency for foreign buyers to want to increase nearby purchases to cover their future needs.'' And that could cause even further upward pressure on commodity prices. Are there indications now that foreign buyers might be getting leery of higher prices for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain? `` No, there has n't been much activity of late in the international market,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. `` Not much is being sold anywhere. There seems to be a general lull all over.'' So it's wait-and-see what the drought will do, at least for many foreign buyers. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not revised its latest export forecast, which showed the value of shipments in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 could rise to $ 33.5 billion from $ 27.9 billion last season. The actual volume of products in the month-old forecast is expected to rise to 145.5 million metric tons from 129.2 million tons in 1986-87. Except for soybeans, which are in relatively scant supply, the inventories of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn are more than ample to take care of foreseeable export needs. The big question, which officials say ca n't be answered now, is how much 1988 crop production will be reduced and how far prices will increase. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Drazek </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office agreed that export prospects are undecipherable at this point. `` Any time you have a drought of the apparent magnitude that this is, you have to start to be concerned about what it will do to our export volume,'' he said. `` My guess is that nobody quite knows what the effect will be on production, so it's going to be difficult to attach some kind of an estimate to the effect on exports.'' `` But with the price going up the way it is,'' <PERSON> Drazek </PERSON> continued, `` that alone will have a depressing effect on our ability to move products.'' Although there is a `` one-world market'' for some commodities, he said, `` our prices are going to be less competitive ... and that could have an effect on where people buy.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The next couple of weeks are going to really make the determination as to what starts to happen in that export market.'' <PERSON> Denman </PERSON> said that he `` would n't be surprised'' to see some foreign buyers come back into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for corn and other feed grains to protect themselves against further crop deterioration and even higher prices. Regarding wheat, <PERSON> Denman </PERSON> said that a lot will depend on the quality of this year's European harvest and also on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s production `` It's not just in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That Canadian crop, as I understand it, is really being hurt pretty bad, too.''

<HEAD>Democratic Party Panel To Review Platform Draft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic platform writers, borrowing a page from congressional procedures, are putting a preliminary draft into a format that a party panel can mark up when it resumes deliberations Friday in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The Democratic platform drafting committee, headed by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, has already distributed a draft document to the campaigns of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman serving as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s chief link to the platform committee, said Wednesday, `` There will be a draft put before the members Friday morning.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said the draft incorporates the dozen separate issue `` working papers'' produced at an earlier meeting of the platform writers on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` It pulls them all together,'' he said. But <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said there has been no closing of the gap between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps on whether the platform should embrace <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for higher taxes on the wealthy and a freeze on Pentagon spending. <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the preliminary draft was still being finalized. She called it `` a collective effort'' by the same people who hammered out the earlier issue papers. The party released two final working papers on national security and political empowerment. The former reflects the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's insistence that the platform call for `` stable'' defense budgets; the latter, in a nod to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, commits the party to removing `` impediments to the one-person, one-vote principle.'' Whatever emerges Friday from <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s 16-member drafting committee will be subject to further discussion and revision when the full 186-member <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets over the weekend in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for the first time. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has enough delegates to force a floor fight at next month's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> over any platform issue he chooses. Some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers have hinted they would welcome a chance to shoot down a plank promising a tax hike. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the 1984 nominee, got nothing but grief from his promise to raise taxes. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has had his staff put the draft in mark-up format, with numbered lines, to make it easier for the drafting committee to make additions and deletions. Although a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has been handling his drafting role in an impartial fashion. The 16 members include six each from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps and four appointed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the party chairman, who has asked the platform writers to produce a short, visionary statement, free of special interest boilerplates. The new working paper on national security says the nation's strength has been `` sapped by a defense establishment that has wasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility. `` We further believe that our strength is enhanced by stable defense budgets and by a commitment by our allies to assure their fair share of the costs and responsibilities required to maintain peace and liberty,'' the paper says. It says the Democrats `` will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> ... not by toasting a tyrant like <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat, in standing up to any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adversary whenever necessary and sitting down with him whenever possible.'' The document calls for `` maintaining the special relationship with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' while promoting a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> agreement that hews to the Camp David Accords. It says a Democratic administration would `` end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagement and will declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state -LRB- and -RRB- impose comprehensive sanctions.'' The paper would commit the party to same-day voter registration and registration by mail and calls for a removal of `` impedidents to the one-person, one-vote principle,'' it said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who won 29 percent of the primary votes but just 24 percent of the delegates, has complained about the way some states allocated delegates.

<HEAD>Classified Documents Ruling Indicates Fall Trial for North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case is setting up procedures for dealing with classified documents in an apparent effort to bring fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to trial by fall. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered North to identify by July 11 which secret government documents the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel wants to disclose in court to rebut charges that he illegally diverted Iranian arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. In a ruling on Wednesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that both the public and prosecutors would be barred from a July 14 hearing to determine if any of the documents are relevant to the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The judge also rejected a defense motion to declare the Classified Information Procedures Act unconstitutional as it applied to the case of North, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. The four defendants, whom <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has said must be tried separately, contended that the law unfairly required them to tell the prosecution what documents they intended to make public before the trials. Such disclosures would give independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> an unfair tactical advantage, the defense said. Acknowledging the problem, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` strict application of the statute to this proceeding would not only be difficult, but impossible to accomplish consistent with a fair and expeditious resolution of this case.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> noted that the large volume of classified documents collected by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation about 200,000 pages by the latest count _ posed unique problems for a trial judge that were probably not envisioned when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the classified information statute in 1980. `` Some of the witnesses and defendants, particularly <PERSON> North </PERSON>, operated from secure locations in the White House with full access to the most sensitive information and most critical national security intelligence methods and sources available to the government,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` This information, and even some methods and sources, are inextricably enmeshed in the events challenged by the indictment,'' he added. But in enacting the law, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave trial judges authority `` to fashion creative and fair solutions'' to difficult problems posed by such sensitive information, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. Lawmakers `` emphasized that the court should not undertake to balance the national security interests of the government against the rights of the defendant but rather that in the end remedies and sanctions against the government must be designed to make the defendant whole again.'' `` While afforded this leeway, the court is unable to determine definitively at this stage whether or not the classified document problems presented by this case can be resolved,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in the 16-page opinion. `` It proposes to make the effort, but the complexity of the situation defies obvious answers. Final ruling on the -LRB- defense -RRB- motion must await further developments.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that he would exclude <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from discussions of whether classified documents that <PERSON> North </PERSON> proposes to disclose are relevant to the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> will decide which documents are relevant and admissible as evidence. Only after an interdepartmental task force has identified relevant documents that pose national security problems will <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> be included in the process of how to present them in court, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. Indicating a desire to move the case to trial, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> gave the government secrecy experts until Aug. 1 to complete their review of the documents identified by North. The task force, composed of representatives of various government intelligence agencies, is reviewing the documents that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> collected during his investigation from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. After the panel's task is completed, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would convene closed hearings to determine how to edit out portions of documents that can not be declassified. Under the law, the court has the power to order deletions of sensitive material or to substitute a statement of facts that the document would prove if it were shown to the jury. If a sufficient number of documents can not be disclosed in any fashion, the court can dismiss charges against a defendant on the ground he could not get a fair trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s ruling follows his determination last week that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation was not tainted by impermissible use of the testimony that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> gave to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year under limited grants of immunity from prosecution Both decisions indicate that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has determined that, barring unforeseen problems created by classified documents, the case can move ahead to trial by September. In a statement, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said: `` We appreciate the court's prompt ruling on the constitutionality of the Classified Information Procedures Act as it applies to this case and we are prepared to move forward as directed by the court.''

<HEAD>Panel Wants Two Special Tax Breaks Back in Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House tax-writers want to renew two targeted benefits of the type that were supposed to be wiped out when the tax law was overhauled in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to renew for three years a tax benefit for employees who receive educational assistance from their bosses, and to extend for one year a special credit for owners of low-income rental housing. The panel, working on a package of miscellaneous tax items proposed by Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., is considering extension of a third special benefit: tax-exempt mortgage bonds used to help low-income people buying their first home That exemption is a favorite of state and local government officials, who administer the mortgage assistance. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the auditing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, says the program `` does little to increase home ownership opportunities.'' About $ 50 billion of such bonds were issued between 1982 and 1986, at a cost to the federal government of about $ 7.5 billion, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated. About two-thirds of the homebuyers who benefited could have bought their homes without assistance, the agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wiped out several such special-interest benefits when it revised the tax law two years ago, contending that the tax system should not be used to provide subsidies when federal appropriations could do the job better. But several still remain. The committee hopes to complete work next week on this year's tax bill, which is designed mainly to correct hundreds of errors that found their way into the 1986 law The `` technical corrections'' bill is being used as the vehicle for a few substantive tax amendments, including those proposed by <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. The committee, meeting behind closed doors, voted Wednesday to: _ Tighten and renew through 1990 an expired law under which employees could avoid tax on up to $ 5,250 a year worth of educational assistance provided by their employers The benefit was designed to help lower-income workers prepare for better jobs. Under the new version, the exclusion would be reduced as income rises above a level that is yet to be determined, and upper-income workers would receive no benefit. No benefit would be available for post-graduate work. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes renewal of the exclusion, which would cost the government about $ 540 million. _ Extend for one year the credit for owners of low-income rental housing, which is due to expire at the end of 1989 This would cost $ 543 million. _ Write into law an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decision that sick pay, accumulated vacation leave and similar compensation received by employees of state and local governments and non-profit organizations should not be taxed when earned _ Exempt from Social Security taxes the wages of members of Amish and other religious sects that have religious objections to such programs Committee aides estimated this would affect about 10,000 workers; about 750 self-employed people _ most of them <LOCATION> Amish </LOCATION> _ already are exempt. _ Deny Social Security benefits to any person who in the future is ordered deported as a Nazi war criminal _ Exempt from taxation a $ 10-million trust fund created in 1985 to finance rehabilitation of <LOCATION> Enjebi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Enewetak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used as a target for testing nuclear weapons in the 1940s and 1950s A similar exemption was voted in 1982 for the benefit of <LOCATION> Bikini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The biggest portion of the tax increase required to pay for the benefits in the bill would come from corporations that own shares of other corporations and from owners of single-premium life insurance.

<TEXT>
 State and local governments and other private employers have received some welcome news from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a decision that could save them billions of dollars in pension benefits. The court on Wednesday used a case from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to limit the application of two previous rulings, which bar sex discrimination, in determining retirement benefits. `` We're very happy and very pleased,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMullian </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s division of retirement. `` We really thought they would rule in our favor all along and that's why we took it to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' By a 5-4 vote, the justices said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> taxpayers do not have to pay $ 43.6 million to male state workers who retired between March 24, 1972, and Aug. 1, 1983. The court said that it would be unfair to retroactively apply the anti-discrimination principles the court first established in a 1978 ruling and greatly expanded in 1983. Imposing such extra costs on pension plans would threaten their existence and, therefore, the rights of other workers to collect benefits, the court said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study estimates that the ruling will save public and private employers nationwide from $ 817 million to $ 1.26 billion a year well into the next century. The court in 1978 barred employers from requiring women to make higher contributions to pension plans based on their generally longer lifespans, even though as a group they receive more retirement benefits as a result. In 1983, the court made it illegal for women to receive smaller monthly retirement pay than men based on life expectancy when employees of both sexes contributed equal amounts. That ruling took effect Aug. 1, 1983. Both pension benefit rulings were based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banning sex discrimination in the work place. Until Wednesday, the court had not said whether the sex-neutral principles it established in the pension cases apply to a vast number of workers who retired sometime between 1964 and 1983. The justices said Wednesday that employers, such as the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> government, should not be penalized for failing to eliminate all sex-based pension options after the court's 1978 ruling. That decision failed to place employers on notice that all pension options taking gender into account were illegal, the court said. Some options in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state retirement plan continued to use sex-based mortality rates until 1983. The state was sued by male workers on behalf of themselves and their wives, who also were beneficiaries of the pension plan. They said their benefits were reduced illegally because of the use of the sex-based life expectancy figures. Lower courts ruled in their favor and ordered the state to pay an additional $ 43.6 million in benefits to them. In other decisions, the court: _ Upheld by a 6-3 vote the way <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> courts administer that state's death penalty law, dashing the hopes of about 260 death row inmates _ Split 5-4 in upholding an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> man's murder conviction and death sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to exclude one potential juror The juror was disqualified when the defendant's lawyer used one of the defense's limited number of automatic challenges. _ Ruled, 8-1, in a case from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that federal judges may not throw out an indictment because of a prosecutor's misconduct unless the defendant can show there would have been no indictment without such misconduct

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Drug and Alcohol Testing For Rail Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation requiring the nation's railroad workers to undergo random drug testing has begun to make progress in the election-year conscious House. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> transportation, tourism and hazardous materials subcommittee voted 13-0 on Wednesday to send the measure to the full Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who has been reluctant to support the measure, is now expected to give the legislation prompt consideration `` I expect it to be called up right away,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the subcommittee chairman, after his panel approved the bill. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> co-sponsored the measure with Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, who said public support for ridding drug and alcohol abuse from the transportation industry is `` simply overwhelming.'' There has been growing support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for drug testing legislation since Jan. 4, 1987, when an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train and three <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives collided in Chase, Md. The crash killed 16 people and injured 175 others, and two <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> crewmen have admitted to having smoked marijuana shortly before the disaster. Railroad labor officials have opposed proposals for random testing, saying that the procedures would violate the privacy of the workers and unfairly threaten their careers because of the risk of inaccurate laboratory analysis. That opposition has been diminishing, however, as election-year pressures have increased for lawmakers to do something about drug abuse. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> proposed drug testing rules for railroad workers on May 5 that many union leaders consider harsher than the legislation. The bill would require not only random testing, which supporters say would deter alcohol and drug abuse, but testing after accidents, before hiring, for reasonable cause and as a part of annual physical examinations. Workers who test positive would be given a second, more sophisticated test to confirm the results. If they test positive again, they would be suspended without pay and required to complete rehabilitation programs to keep their jobs. Employees who refuse to take tests would risk being fired. Procedures would be established to certify the laboratories being used and to protect workers against harassment. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, who had long expressed fears about erroneous test results, resisted introducing legislation until June 3. That was five weeks after Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hunt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, whose daughter <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION>, 16, was killed in the Chase crash, visited newspapers and television and radio stations in <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> district to argue that random testing was needed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has already approved legislation that would require random drug and alcohol testing for railroad, airline and trucking industry workers. Rail workers involved in accidents are already subject to drug and alcohol tests, but those rules are being challenged in court.

<HEAD>EPA Asks 10 States To Develop Aldicarb Management Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under a new proposal, 10 states in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and Southeast are going to have to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> how they will protect ground water from contamination with the highly toxic pesticide aldicarb. In its first action under a draft strategy aimed at protecting ground water from pesticides, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that it was considering an alternative that would require `` pesticide management plans'' from as many as 24 states. Only the 10 states in the main proposal, chosen on the basis of their crops and the general vulnerability of ground water, were identified: <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In the first five, aldicarb has not been found in ground water; in the second five, it has been found in concentrations above 10 parts per billion, which is the amount the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> considers safe. Ground water, which supplies drinking water to half the nation's population, was once thought safe from pollution But evidence to the contrary has accumulated in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has found 63 pesticides in ground water. The agency reported that one-third of about 35,000 ground water samples it tested contained some aldicarb. <ORGANIZATION> Aldicarb </ORGANIZATION>, sold under the trade name Temik by <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, is used on potatoes, citrus, peanuts, cotton and other crops to protect them against scores of insects, root worms and mites. As much as 5.7 million pounds of the pesticide are used each year. Its use already is restricted, and it is banned in a few areas like <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where 3,100 homes must use expensive charcoal filtration to remove it from their well water. In humans, aldicarb can interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses. High concentrations can cause digestive upset, dehydration, blurred vision, disorientation, seizures, unconsciousness and death. More than 1,000 poisonings and two stillbirths were reported in Western states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1985 from California-grown watermelons contaminated with aldicarb. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been studying the pesticide for four years, and still is investigating how much might be in typical diets. The manufacturer said Wednesday its latest survey showed `` residues were rarely present.'' The agency's draft strategy leaves many key decisions to the states, like banning aldicarb's use in certain areas and limiting frequency of application. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for pesticides, told reporters Wednesday that the agency probably would ban use of aldicarb in states that refuse to submit plans. States might win <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> approval to permit contamination of ground water that would n't be used for drinking water, he said, as long as residents of the state have had a chance to comment on the plan. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also is proposing to ban aldicarb use within 300 feet of any well and to require state training programs for applicators to teach about ground water effects. <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal reflects `` sound principles for drinking water protection,'' and said it would cooperate. A company spokesman, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmotzer </PERSON>, said, `` We are going to manage this product even more stringently than required, as we are doing in some instances now.'' In some counties in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he said, the company requires 1,000-foot well protection zones. Elsewhere, though, 50 feet might suffice, and <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> might seek a variable zone in comments to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schmotzer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for not considering non-chemical strategies, such as crop rotations, in calculating the costs and benefits of aldicarb use. In addition to the five states from which <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> wants management plans, aldicarb also has been found in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION> in concentrations above 10 ppb, and in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in concentrations below that. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal also would require <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> to monitor ground water the agency considers highly vulnerable in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> says he's afraid there will be a dangerous overreaction by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public to disclosures of a massive <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud and bribery investigation. `` You do n't close a bank because there's been a bank robbery,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` And you do n't conclude that we do n't need a strong defense because of the actions of some faithless employees. It's important to bear in mind that the needs of defense have n't changed at all as a result of these stories.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> also said that he had no apologies to make for his management style while serving as secretary of defense. He said he did n't know about the federal investigation until it was revealed last week. Nor, he said, did he have any suspicions of wrongdoing before he left office last November. `` I think the -LRB- contract -RRB- procedures in effect are proper,'' the former defense chief and presidential confidant said. `` We needed to regain military strength quickly and we did. But I did n't exercise any hands-off management technique. I had briefings regularly, once a week or every two weeks, on the major weapons programs. `` But no matter how careful you are, you're not going to be able to eliminate dishonesty.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> served almost seven years as secretary of defense before stepping down because of the ill health of his wife. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the ongoing fraud and bribery probe began during his tenure and involved, at least to some extent, contracting actions that occurred before his departure. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say the inquiry centers on allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> executives took bribes from private military consultants who were seeking classified contract information for their clients. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> insisted he had seen nothing in news reports about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation to call into question the contracting rules and regulations used by the Pentagon. He also complained that talk of scandal was prompting lawmakers to twist facts about the administration's performance. `` We need to keep a sense of proportion without jumping to conclusions,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> awards 52,000 contracts every single day, and inevitably there may be some faithless or dishonest people. `` Now, a lot of totally incorrect statements are being made in the heat of battle. Sen. -LRB- Charles -RRB- <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> -LRB- R-Iowa -RRB- said 6 percent of defense contracts are awarded competitively. It's really 60 percent. Sixty percent of the contracts by dollar value. It's 82 percent by number of contract actions.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s defense of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> came just one day after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered similar observations, saying bribery and fraud were `` understandable'' within the huge bureaucracy of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and that no one could keep track of all defense employees and military contractors. While echoing those views, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> made clear he did not condone the misconduct. `` I do n't have any hesitancy in saying anyone found guilty of bribing or receiving bribes or giving out classified information ought to be administered full punishment,'' he said.

 One of the defense lawyers in the burgeoning Pentagon contract-fraud investigation suggests, not entirely in jest, that this could become the most politically popular scandal in years. `` This is the best thing that's happened to both the Republicans and Democrats in six months, because for the Republicans it gets everybody's mind off -LRB- Attorney General -RRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and for the Democrats it gets everybody's mind off -LRB- House Speaker -RRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' said this lawyer, who was not interested in having his or his client's name further publicized. `` So what you have is a natural tendency on the part of both parties to try to pump it up. You've got a Republican, -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, who's pumping it up, and you've got the Democrats too'' including Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the lawyer added. All four have joined the public outcry over the affair. `` It's the one thing everybody can join in on because it gets reporters off their leadership,'' the lawyer said. `` It's terrific, a perfect opportunity.'' This experienced attorney is among a dozen <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers already hired by contractors, consultants and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who are named in government search warrants or grand jury subpoenas. He was giving his admittedly self-interested view of how government investigators had received such voluminous and favorable publicity for their side of the case through leaks, speeches and news conferences even before bringing any charges or making any arrests. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who 365 days out of most years solemnly refuses to discuss ongoing investigations in public, even held a news conference to outline the scope of the investigation and rebut <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>'s complaints that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had moved too slowly. Since the government's coordinated searches on June 14, the Pentagon story has muscled two high-profile investigations off the nation's front pages: the special prosecutor's imminent report on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> used his office to benefit himself and friends, and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics investigation of Democratic Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s finances and official actions The well-known names <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> have been replaced by those of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats, private consultants and contractors who are hardly household words _ <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and others. Even the congressmen whose names have been pulled in by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or investigative leakers as potentially of interest to investigators are not the best known on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ Democrats <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; and Republican <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Aides to those five point out that even the leakers do n't say they're under investigation at this time. Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> publicly says no one on the Hill is now a target. This is as close as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scandal comes to catnip for politicians. As <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> GOP chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strake </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, `` Every morning when I wake up, I run out to get the paper and see what the scandal of the day is, whether it's on them or us.'' The defense lawyer also offered some cautionary words for those tempted to translate leaks and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> search warrant affidavits into automatic convictions. `` It's a specific federal crime if you trade inside information on Wall Street, but there is a sensitive information flow between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and its contractors that is not only legal but even encouraged. Only in certain circumstances is that illegal,'' he said. The leakers have crowed over how unguarded their targets were as government agents secretly monitored their telephone calls and office conversations. But this lawyer, who has heard similar government tapes before, said, `` They may not have tapes that are that clear and what they are hearing may be legal or illegal depending on the intent involved.'' `` The tapes may have showed a need to check further,'' the lawyer said. But he emphasized that further investigation is just beginning with last week's massive seizure of records and the efforts to persuade targets to confess and cooperate. Even if the leakers are correct, he said, `` this would be dozens of separate, small conspiracies that take time to investigate _ not one, big conspiracy.'' All the search warrants were done together so that one search did not alert other people who might be involved in separate, similar schemes to begin shredding their documents. Based on his experience, this lawyer said, `` The people hemorrhaging information now are the ones who know the least. The ones who know the most do n't talk at this stage.''

<HEAD>Weeks Before Farm Drought Aid Bill to be Ready</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> advocates of providing income guarantees for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drought-plagued farmers concede that it will take weeks just to fashion a bill, let alone push it through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is an ongoing process; nothing is set in stone,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Wednesday after a congressional task force approved broad outlines of a drought-relief package. The blueprint is short on specifics and bound to come in for changes in weeks ahead. In fact, one feature _ to allow growing oats on idled acreage _ was approved as part of the plan, then quietly scuttled within the hour to keep peace with a skeptical <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. The general proposal calls for guaranteeing farm incomes but leaves the contentious task of developing a formula for later. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., had said earlier that task force members should sit down and stay in session until they worked out a blueprint for providing assistance He told the task force that at least some document was needed as a sign to farmers that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> means business about providing help. `` What I saw in the Northern Plains I never would have believed,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, who headed a visit by six senators to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> over the weekend. He also noted that beef and pork prices are falling and he issued a sternly worded warning to food companies not to raise consumer prices. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told the task force that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not mean to express opposition to drought assistance when he said at a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> news conference that there was little he could do about the situation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> merely `` exhibited some of the frustration that some of the rest of us have that you ca n't do anything to make it rain,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. He said the president favors some form of assistance. `` I accept your explanation,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. The task force called for speeded-up action by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to allow farmers in drought-stricken counties to obtain 92 percent of their normal `` deficiency payments,'' even if they are prevented by drought from planting. Such a measure would come under the department's `` zero-92'' program, which ordinarily permits farmers to plant none of their acreage and still receive 92 percent of the payments. Deficiency payments are income supports representing the difference between market prices and target prices set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture. The group urged `` maximum flexibility'' in applying a rule that farmers must plant so-called cover crops, such as grasses, on lands idled for conservation purposes. Sizeable amounts of land are idled for such purposes under provisions of the 1985 farm law that sought not only to prevent erosion but to take land out of production to combat surpluses. Other task force recommendations: _ A search for ways to make sure producers will have sufficient herds to resume livestock breeding when the drought is over Breeders are selling off stock because of lack of feed. _ Development of ways to expand participation in the federal crop insurance program _ Use of all authority provided under last year's bailout bill for the Farm Credit System, a nationwide network of lending institutions, to restructure loan payments for farmers hard hit by drought _ Emergency loans for farmers if conditions worsen <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and other task force members have been saying that a spate of election-year drought aid bills would not help in passing an aid package. But two <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> lawmakers pushed ahead Wednesday, saying there was no reason to delay. Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>, D-Mich., introduced a measure that would use in-kind payments to repay farmers up to 50 percent of drought <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON> said his measure had no dollar limit and might not be the one that ends up passing but added that some form of aid would do so. He said the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., will make certain that an aid measure wins approval `` <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> has never met a disaster that he did n't tackle,'' <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON> said, `` and I assure you that he will tackle this one.

 Thirty-six cars of train derailed and one car filled with phosphorus burst into flames Wednesday night, forcing 2,500 people to evacuate and bans on flights over four counties, officials said. No injuries were reported, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, spokesman for the state Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>. He said a phosphorus fire can not be quenched and must burn itself out. Smoke from the fire could explode when temperatures reach 90 degrees, he said. `` You're talking about big, big, big trouble,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. `` Water makes it burn hotter.'' The evacuation was ordered for residents of <LOCATION> Nortonville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> downwind to the east of the burning car, which derailed in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Hopkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> line. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> early Thursday restricted all air travel over those counties and over <ORGANIZATION> Muhlenberg </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION> counties. Two highways also were closed, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> train derailed at 7:55 p.m., 3 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Crofton </LOCATION>, a community of 800 in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, state police said. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said smoke from the fire could be seen up to 30 miles away. No one in <LOCATION> Crofton </LOCATION>, population 800, was evacuated, said Novi Mainire of the <LOCATION> Crofton </LOCATION> police department.

<HEAD>Acne Drug Prevents Skin Cancer In People At High Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study published today shows that the acne medicine Accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin cancer in humans, but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for routine use. Accutane, a vitamin A derivative that can cause birth defects in pregnant women, sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited genetic disorder, the study shows. While Accutane can not be taken for long periods by most people, other synthetic forms of vitamin A may someday be routinely used to prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years of exposure to the sun, the researchers said. In addition, vitamin A drugs may someday be used to treat other tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, bladder, cervix and breast, said Dr. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The odds are that within the lifetime of many people, we may well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer in high-risk people,'' he said. The treatment is an example of the young field of chemoprevention. Until now, medicines have been given almost exclusively to attack cancers once they occur rather than to prevent them from forming. `` This is the first study that has scientifically proven in humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` We use sun screens because they should work, but we still have not rigorously proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be prevented with that method.'' However, he cautioned that the study, conducted on just five people, is very small, and it is unclear whether the findings will apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer. The study was directed by Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. About 500,000 Americans are treated each year for basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer, the most common forms of cancer. These tumors, which are usually curable, occur most frequently in light-skinned people exposed to too much sun. `` You are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>. `` But if that is n't the case, this is an indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression of the damage to cancer.'' Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, is widely used to clear up severe acne. Because of its possible danger for pregnant women, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last month ordered its maker, <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, to warn customers by printing a picture of a deformed baby on the drug's packaging. In the cancer study, high doses were taken by five people with xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare disorder in which the body is unable to repair genetic damage caused by sunlight. In the two years before taking Accutane, the patients studied had a total of 121 cancerous tumors. While on the drug, they had 25. When the drug was stopped, they had nearly a nine-fold increase in the frequency of tumors. However, two people had to drop out of the study because of side effects. One had high levels of blood fats, while the other showed signs of liver abnormalities. <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON> said that high doses of Accutane may be warranted for some people who have frequent skin cancers because of their lifelong exposure to the sun, `` but for the general population, it's much too toxic.'' More than 2,000 similar vitamin A compounds already exist, and some of them may be safe and effective enough to protect ordinary people from skin cancers, scientists say.

<TEXT>
 If there are fewer cherries to bake into pies this fall, part of the blame can be put on the drought. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that production of tart cherries is expected to drop 41 percent from last year' harvest of 358.5 million pounds to 211 million pounds In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the largest producer, the crop was estimated at 150 million pounds, down 43 percent from 1987. Severe spring freezes, drought and a high fruit dropoff in June were blamed for the decline in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> production. And rain is needed `` within the next few weeks'' for the remaining cherries to grow properly, the report said. Production in the four leading states accounts for about 94 percent of this year's expected tart cherry production. Others include: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 23 million pounds, down from 35 million in 1987; <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, 15 million, down from 29 million; and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, 9 million, down from 14 million. The crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 175,400 tons, down 17 percent from last year's harvest of 210,800 tons. Department officials say sweet cherry output in the Western states is mostly quoted by the ton, while Eastern practice favors pounds. Since most production is in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the agency reports sweet cherries in tons. The top four producers of sweet cherries in this year's forecast are: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 32,000 tons, down from 45,000 last year; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 22,000, down from 32,000; <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 45,000, down from 50,000; and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 67,000, down from 74,000.

 One-time Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> has endorsed likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, nine months after a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide circulated an `` attack video'' that helped push <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> out of the race. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, telephoned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from his home, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s office said Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a mathematical lock on the nomination. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign reacted to the call with satisfaction. `` Obviously we are delighted,'' said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, who praised the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> senator as `` someone who has national stature and has gained a reputation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as a leader and a fighter.'' `` His reputation as an effective and forceful leader on foreign policy, on education and other domestic issues is something that we feel can be a tremendous help to our campaign,'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who is recovering from brain surgery, assured the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor that he would work on his behalf when he returns to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later this year, his office said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s office said the senator told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> he was `` very confident the Democrats will win back the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and retain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in November.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> ended his quest for the presidency on Sept. 23, 1987, after a week in which his campaign was rocked by admissions of plagiarism and of false claims about his academic record. He was also criticized for lifting sections of other politicians' speeches without attribution. A videotape, juxtaposing a <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> campaign speech with a speech by British politician <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> and showing striking similarities between the two, was sent to various news organizations. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said he had credited <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> on other occasions, but had neglected to do so that time. It was later revealed that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager, distributed the video. One day after news reports linked the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to the video, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor admitted that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was the source of the video. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> resigned from the campaign, as did <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign issues director. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, 45, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was released from the hospital last month after successful surgery to correct an aneurysm near his brain. It was the second aneurysm he had suffered since February. An aneurysm is a ballooning of the weakened wall of an artery and is caused by disease or injury.

<HEAD>Consultants: Tearing Down Part Of Moscow Chancery `An Engineering

<TEXT>
 Consultants hired by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have concluded that to tear down a portion of the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> chancery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be an `` engineering nightmare,'' according to a report published today. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and intelligence officers disclosed last year that the unfinished building was riddled with Soviet listening devices. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked a team of engineers, architects and security experts to study the structure and analyze solutions for making it secure. The consultants, in their initial finding, have concluded that `` partial deconstruction'' of the eight-story building `` is n't feasible'' and would be more dangerous and difficult than demolishing the entire the structure and rebuilding, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today One of the consultants referred to `` an engineering nightmare,'' the Times said. The new chancery was to have been the main embassy building for diplomatic and classified activities. But after $ 22 million was spent on it, construction was stopped in 1985. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the department has received a portion of the consultants' report, but the complete report is not due until August. The source said no decision on what to do about the building has been made. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, told the Times, `` The building experts are saying that a partial deconstruction is n't feasible, because it is very difficult to take a portion of the building and build on the existing structure.'' `` Just from the efficiency of the construction, you're better off taking the whole thing down,'' <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> added. The current embassy, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> occupied in the early 1950s, consists of one building. It's undergoing a $ 32.5 million renovation.

<HEAD>New Exchange For Adult-Oriented Phone Lines Draws Mixed Reviews</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The telephone company is instituting a new exchange for `` dial-a-porn'' and party-line services that will be available to customers only upon request, in a twist on efforts to keep youngsters from having access to the services. Industry spokesmen say the new exchange could drive the services out of business in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` It will infringe on the rights of people who like this entertainment,'' said <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>, who provides two programs of adult entertainment on 976 lines in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` Their rights will be violated because -LRB- the new service -RRB- requires identification.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has approved <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION>'s request to institute the new exchange for all adult and conversation-line services, which have been available on 976 numbers. The new 915 exchange, expected to be implemented by the end of the summer, will be accessible only by customers who have notified the company they want to have access to it, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> is the first state to approve the subscription exchange for dial-a-porn lines, <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said Sports lines, financial services and other information lines will remain on 976 exhanges, he said. `` It would essentially wipe out the vast majority of the 976 industry,'' charged <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, treasurer of the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audiotex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> describes the group as a loose-knit organization of about 175 services in the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington-Philadelphia </LOCATION> area. Callers to many 976 programs, such as teen party lines, dial-a-date lines or other conversation lines, make the call on impulse, <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. The change to a subscription-type service would eliminate those `` spontaneous-response'' callers, he said. Under the telephone company's plan, a customer wishing to obtain access to the 915 lines would have to sign a consent form. Names of those signing the forms would be kept confidential. Customers now can request that access from their phone be blocked to certain 976 numbers. The new system will work in reverse, providing the 915 service only to those people who specifically request it by signing the form, <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said. Across the country, `` dial-a-porn'' and party line services have drawn criticisms from some who complain that they are too easily accessible by children who have in some cases run up huge bills without their parents' knowledge. `` The purpose is to provide customers increased control over which services would be accessed from their telephone service and to minimize billing disputes with customers,'' <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said. One provider of 976 service in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area thinks the change will have a positive effect on telephone information services. `` I think it's the best thing for it,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, who operates the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 976 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, which operates information services but no dial-a-porn lines. `` You're going to have more people who are going to come into the information-providing area. They're not thinking -LRB- 976 service -RRB- is going out of business. I think they've done away with the objectionable part of it.'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> agreed that the subscription service could eliminate billing disputes. `` There's no excuse for somebody to say they did n't know what they were getting,'' he said. `` They signed up.'' But <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> contended that the adult-oriented business will suffer because people wo n't want to be identified as a subscriber to 915. `` It's a very touchy issue, and it's being approached in a very negative way,'' he said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audiotex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the group is considering legal action to block the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. The commission is using the 915 service to drive dial-a-porn lines from the marketplace, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, adding, `` What they're doing is doing indirectly what they ca n't do directly. Annual revenue from 976-type services is about $ 330 million nationwide, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulletin </ORGANIZATION>, an industry newsletter. Of that, about $ 54 million is from `` dial-a-porn'' lines; $ 90 million from conference conversation lines; and $ 186 million from general-interest lines, such as recorded sports results.

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judicial system is being `` held hostage'' by politicians and judges who get their legal views from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. That line won a round of applause from the audience of sheriffs. But at least one member of the audience _ a supporter of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions `` simplistic.'' Sheriff <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rufo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, claimed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tough talk on fighting crime is `` no more than a Republican smokescreen to divert attention from where they are weak. <PERSON> Rufo </PERSON> was in the audience on Wednesday as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered a strongly worded law-and-order speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> He dismissed some of the vice president's views on crime as `` complete idiocy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with no public appearances scheduled. However, aides said he planned to meet at breakfast with former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he decides to name a woman to his ticket. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said there was no indication of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> would discuss, and the vice president on Wednesday reiterated that he had not yet begun to consider any specific individuals for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made light of recent polls showing far more support for him among men than among women voters. `` You hear a lot about the gender gap,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told local interviewers. `` What you do is spell out your positions on the issues and the gender gap goes away and you win the election. That's what happened in 1984 and that's exactly what I want to have happen in 1988.'' In his speech to the sheriffs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> without naming him in what the vice president billed as a non-partisan address. `` For too many years, we've been held hostage by well-meaning but misguided politicians and judges who get their legal views from the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, a reference to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> often takes unpopular positions in representing individuals or organizations it contends have been deprived of their constitutional rights. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had called himself `` a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` That was a quote of his. That is not exactly the mainstream of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> politics,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his support for the death penalty for major drug dealers and for drug-related deaths, but said he would not advocate such a penalty for those convicted of drunken driving in a fatal accident. `` I draw the line there,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also took another swipe at what is becoming a favorite target: the since-abandoned <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program for prison furloughs under which some convicted first-degree murderers were let out of prison on weekend passes. `` The view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not just naive, it's dead wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the sheriffs' organization. `` When first-degree murderers sentenced to life without parole get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences, that view goes from naive to dangerous, from well-meaning to irresponsible,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted details of the case of <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a convicted <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and accused of raping a woman while he was free. Sheriff <PERSON> Rufo </PERSON>, who is the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that `` there were 121,000 successful furloughs before that incident.'' <PERSON> Rufo </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited but did not initiate the prison furlough program and now opposes allowing first-degree murderers out of prison on weekend leave, just as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does. `` He shares the vice president's views on furloughs,'' said <PERSON> Rufo </PERSON>, who wore a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign button to the event.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ducked questions about whether <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be a liability on the Democratic ticket, while the search for a running mate picked up steam. Campaign sources said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ along with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> _ had been asked to submit background and financial information, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was being asked as well. The soliciting of such information from potential running mates indicates interest on the part of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. But at least one potential running mate moved to take himself out of the running. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatiello </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, said Wednesday the senator had `` made it absolutely clear, both publicly and privately'' to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> that he was not interested. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> is heading the running-mate search. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s office has said it had not been asked to supply the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign with background information. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, asked if that meant <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was not being considered, answered with a quick `` no.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told reporters Wednesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would receive `` very serious consideration'' as his running mate despite lacking government experience. Asked about surveys suggesting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could hurt the Democratic ticket, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sidestepped. `` I'm not going to be checking a lot of polls, believe me. ... We all have our strengths and our weaknesses.'' On the matter of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s qualifications, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know that you have to have held public office to in fact be qualified.'' But, he added, `` It helps.'' In general, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was unwilling to say much about the search for his running mate. `` I do n't think it's helpful ... to do it with press conferences at the end of the driveway every time you talk to somebody,'' he said. `` We've just begun the process.'' The probable <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee today was visiting a day-care center in southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, continuing his attempt to focus on issues he trumpets on the campaign trial. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the endorsement Wednesday of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, who exited the presidential race shortly after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' top aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, distributed a videotape showing <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> had lifted rhetoric from a British politician without attributing the remarks. On another front, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued to defend himself against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that allowed for the release of a murderer who then escaped while on furlough and raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had since tightened eligibility requirements for furloughs to exclude first-degree murderers, and said 45 states and the federal government have some form of furlough system. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was focusing on the furlough-escape case because he had no record of his own to promote on crime issues.

<TEXT>
 A congressional committee is due in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> this week to investigate hunger in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, but a debate already has begun over whether there's an `` underground'' army of starving people in the state. `` We are looking for declining food security in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, where studies show the poor are getting poorer,'' said <PERSON> Timmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, a staff worker for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Select Committee On Hunger. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was selected because all 55 counties of the coal-mining state qualify as part of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, a committee spokesman said. No other state bears that distinction. The committee plans hearings in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> on Friday to listen to food bank workers, community advocates and state welfare officials talk about whether <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s poor are being fed. A few congressmen, led by Rep. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Staggers </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, also will visit the homes of three needy residents to hear their `` There are 100,000 people in poverty in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> who are getting no aid,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It's ironic, considering the federal food stamp program started in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and we're still not reaching all West Virginians. Food stamps were introduced in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1961 under an executive order by President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The state, third in the nation in unemployment, `` really illustrates the problems of the poor,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s poverty rate is 22.3 percent, versus the national average of 18.1 percent for rural areas, Staggers said. Joblessness has run as high as 44 percent in some southern coalfield counties during the past five years, and the state has led the nation in unemployment for much of the decade. Unemployment now is at 7.4 percent by state calculations and 9.7 percent by federal figures. The committee wants to find out whether the rural poor can feed themselves using food stamps, or must rely on other sources for food, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. `` If they have to go to food pantries and kitchens, that is extraordinary means,'' she said. Last month, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based liberal watchdog group, reported that nearly a fourth of West Virginians live in poverty, and that fewer than a third of the state's jobless receive unemployment benefits. `` I have a hard time sustaining that,'' Gov. Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> retorted shortly after the study was released. He said his <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> reports a reduction in the number of people receiving welfare benefits. `` How do these people live?'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> asked. `` There's some that talk about there being an underground around here some place. I'm hard-pressed to figure out where that data base is coming from. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s press aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, said the governor `` obviously is concerned about poverty in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'' but said many of the studies on the state exaggerate the problem. `` If that's true, I'd like to know why we're increasing our food distribution by about 400,000 pounds a year,'' said <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Knicely </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountaineer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes donated groceries to 225 food pantries and kitchens throughout <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The operation and two affiliates in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> distributed 3.2 million pounds of food in 1987, <PERSON> Knicely </PERSON> said. `` If they are n't hungry, it's because the food pantries are feeding them,'' Knicely said. `` I would say the problem goes into malnutrition here _ not starvation. But there are hungry children.'' <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> said federal hunger programs have `` come close to eliminating severe malnutrition'' he saw in rural states in the 1960s. `` But there's still a lot of hunger around. <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> said he is concerned that monthly food stamp allotments are not enough to feed participants, and `` they have to do what they call ` beaning it' _ eat nothing but beans _ the last week or so.''

 Two critically ill Soviet refuseniks have been told by the Soviet government they may soon be allowed to emigrate after years of denials, relatives said Wednesday. The families of <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, 49, have been notified by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that Soviet authorities have withdrawn objections on national security grounds to allowing the two men to leave. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> telephoned him Tuesday to say his brother's eight-year battle for permission to emigrate may soon be over `` I'm grateful, I'm happy and I want him out as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION> home. `` My wish is that no family will have to go through what this family has gone through.'' `` I also got a call from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatusky </PERSON>, who emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in June 1987 `` They told me the Soviets have no objection to my father's leaving.'' <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, had written President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appealing for help in the couple's 11-year wait for exit visas and the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> considered visiting her home during the recent U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The visit reportedly was canceled after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were warned that a presidential stop would doom the family's chances to emigrate. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> and and <PERSON> Khatusky </PERSON> said neither of their relatives had been officially granted permission to leave. But both said they believe their release is just a matter of time. `` I trust the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Khatusky </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>. The first indications the matter was about to be resolved came Tuesday, when Soviet officials informally notified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western diplomats that the Ziemans would soon be granted exit visas. The word reportedly was conveyed to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> by Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubynin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khatusky </PERSON> said she was told it would take about two weeks for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to formally notify her parents and 12-year-old sister, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, that they may leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, a computer specialist who lost his job when he applied to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until stricken several months ago by a mysterious ailment that left him with double vision and a loss of balance. The condition, diagnosed by some Soviet physicians as a potentially deadly aneurysm, or bulge in a cerebral artery, made the family's quest more urgent because <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> was warned by his doctors not to undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> had been told he is not permitted to leave the country for security reasons, though he contends he never had access to state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet security. `` He has severe brain disorders, we hope he can come here and be examined properly,'' said <PERSON> Khatusky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>, a doctoral student at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said his brother has undergone surgery for a cancerous growth on his back and recently suffered a heart attack. He also has what is believed to be benign tumor growing on the back of his neck. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> offerred <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> free medical care, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said, adding that it's `` doubtless'' he can receive better medical help here than in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>, a mathematician who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> and Instrument Making 17 years ago, had repeatedly been denied exit visas on the grounds that he was privy to state secrets. His brother said a deputy director at the institute had contacted his brother Tuesday to inform him he was `` no longer considered a person who knows vital secrets, and that was the only major obstacle to his way out.''

<HEAD>Civic Club Buys Insurance For Local Police</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A civic group has taken a novel approach to supporting its local police by taking out a $ 1 million insurance policy to cover the township's eight officers if they are killed in the line of duty. The insurance idea came up after the deaths of two Will County auxiliary deputies during a 1983 crime spree in <LOCATION> Homer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON>, president of the Homer Men for Responsible Government. `` We really felt bad about what happened with that incident,'' <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing you can really do to offset something like that. This was just something we felt obligated to do to show that we were concerned.'' In any future tragedy, he said, `` We wanted to make sure that it would n't cause hardship ... to the families of officers.'' The coverage, presented Wednesday to Will County Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON>, would provide up to $ 200,000 for families of each officer killed and up to $ 1 million total. The policy took effect March 1. Dues from the 100-member social and civic organization are paying the $ 3,000 annual premiums. The insurance applies to the sheriff and the seven full-time deputies who patrol Homer Township, a small unincorporated community of 20,000 residents located 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. After a two-year search, the club got <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to provide the policy, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON> said he contacted about a dozen insurance agents, while local agent <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maranto </PERSON> talked to more than 20 companies. `` Everybody said, ` Oh, no problem,''' <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON> said. But later the companies found they had no experience with civic groups buying insurance for local police, and no policies were offered. `` This is a rather unique situation in their making this very gracious and very heart-warming donation,'' Masters said. `` I think that there's a need to protect police officers. They put their life on the line.'' <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON> said many families of slain officers get only $ 25,000 in death benefits from government agencies. In July 1983, two people fatally shot a man and a woman who were parked in a secluded area in the township. Two auxiliary deputies, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, 50, responded to the shots and were gunned down. The bloody rampage ended only after a fifth person was shot and killed. <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON> said he's unsure how much money was given to the deputies' families, but he believes the amounts were minimal. He suggested that many officers have a hard time getting life insurance policies because of the nature of their work. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unaware of any problems. When a police officer is killed, people often take up private collections, but there are limits to what can be raised, <PERSON> Clarage </PERSON> said. `` My idea was, why not have them contribute, but do it ahead of time, and do it in the form of purchasing some really meaningful coverage,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressional Conferees Scale Back Military Role in Drug Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional negotiators working on a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill have scaled back plans for a major military role in the anti-drug effort and have cut President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for Star Wars spending, sources said The <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee has approved all but a few details of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, and expect to complete their work later this week, the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. An agreement will send the huge bill back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floors for approval, and it will then go to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature. The bill authorizes $ 299.5 billion in defense spending for the upcoming fiscal year, down slightly from the $ 300 billion the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to spend in the current year. The sources said Wednesday that the conference committee agreed to increase spending for an anti-drug program in which <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers ride aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships patrolling in offshore waters. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers have civilian arrest powers that they can use if the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels encounter suspected drug-trafficking boats. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has about 300 people assigned to the program, riding aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in teams of five to seven people per vessel. Another 100 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel will be added to the program in the next three months, the sources said. The House had voted overwhelmingly to order <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to have the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> essentially seal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against illegal drug shipments. Later, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> easily voted to give <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers civilian arrest powers if warships stopped suspected drug trafficking vessels in international waters. But the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> strongly opposed both those provisions. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the military should n't get involved in civilian law enforcement and warned that even if it did, illegal drugs still would flow into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The final compromise, while dropping the more far-reaching anti-drug provisions passed by each chamber, requires the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to increase the help it provides to civilian anti-drug agencies in spotting and tracking planes and ships that might be carrying contraband. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> already provide intelligence help from radar planes and ships, and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he has no opposition to increasing that aid. The conference committee, meanwhile, agreed to authorize $ 4.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, the sources said. That is up from the current $ 3.9 billion budget, but far below the $ 4.8 billion <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought. In addition, the conferees dropped an amendment approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would have required a halt in all but the smallest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons tests. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had rejected the proposed ban. The legislators also agreed to authorize $ 250 million each for the Midgetman and MX programs, a pair of controversial efforts to develop new land-based atomic-tipped weapons. Another $ 250 million was approved for spending after a new president is elected Nov. 8, the sources said.

<HEAD>Nevada Reservoir is Drying Up for the First Time Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For nearly three-quarters of a century, <LOCATION> Lahontan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> has made an agricultural oasis of this desert region, weathering good years and bad to irrigate 65,000 acres of alfalfa and other crops. But after two consecutive winters that produced half the normal precipitation in western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lahontan </LOCATION> is drying up for the first time since its completion in 1915. Like many areas in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Plains straining under one of the worst droughts in 50 years, this fertile area will soon be out of water. Some fields will lack irrigation in a few weeks and by mid-September, the 600-mile network of canals will be dry, officials said Wednesday. `` We've got everybody on a 70 percent allocation but it's going to be pretty tough to meet that,'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, project manager of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District said. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBraga </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> farmer and president of the irrigation district, said even the 30 percent cutback `` equates to dollars when you start losing tonnage on the alfalfa.'' When the flow to the alfalfa taps out, `` we'll just try to keep it alive in hopes next year will be a better year,'' he said. `` It is n't a rosy picture.'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the drought could put a $ 14 million dent in the state's agriculture industry, the No. 3 business behind gaming and mining. Alfalfa, a legume with small, purplish flowers that is the region's principal cash crop, is mainly a pasture plant used for hay, which has fallen into short supply throughout the farm belt because of the drought. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said Lahontan currently holds 121,550 acre-feet of water, barely one-third its capacity of 314,000 acre-feet. When it reaches 10,000 acre-feet, or 32.6 million gallons of water, the gates will be closed to maintain a small reserve for next year. An acre-foot is the amount of water that covers one acre to a depth of one foot. The reservoir, which meanders for 20 miles along the former <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bed 35 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, is also a popular destination for fishing, swimming and boating. The project was begun shortly after the turn of the century and within a decade had transformed the desert area into an agricultural oasis. Despite close calls in 1924, 1929 and 1931, the reservoir never has failed the farmers and ranchers it serves. Lahontan is fed by the <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is nearly exhausted, and by water diverted from the <LOCATION> Truckee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> flowing from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> and other smaller upstream reserves. While farmers have made their first cutting of alfalfa, most will at best get only one more cutting rather than the typical three, said <PERSON> Jeanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlan </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>. Those who have made four cuttings in the past are n't likely to be that lucky this summer, she added. `` I'd guess there will be little water left to raise a fourth crop of hay,'' she said. Most farmers make their third harvest between mid-September and mid-October, about the time the water is expected to run out, Ms. <PERSON> Conlan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeBraga </PERSON> said he had not heard of any farmers or ranchers being in danger of foreclosure, `` but that's always a possibility, even in a 100 percent irrigation year.'' `` In years like this, it's that much closer,'' he said. `` Next year's the tough one. With all the reservoirs being empty like they're going to be this fall, it would take an excellent year to get back even close to normal.''

It's not a big surprise that one of the losers in the race is going to bring this up. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> started the exchange in an interview published in Wednesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in which he said his forces would move at the convention to put heavily-populated states such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> toward the front of the string of primaries, rather than at the end. He complained that `` something is skewed'' about a process that gives so much importance to small states such as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, while bigger states play little or no role in picking the party's nominee. `` I will stand for a review of the process,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` We're going to submit a plan dealing with ways to give small states and big states a chance. Right now, for example, you campaign almost a year in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and 10 days in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 Dissident Republicans are formally challenging the credentials of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 77 delegates to the GOP National Convention. The dissidents, who held their own alternative state delegate-selection convention after a dispute over party rules, sent the national party their competing list of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> conventioneers on Wednesday. The list is comprised mainly of the more conservative party activists who supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacies of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. They contend the convention they held was proper and followed party rules to the letter while the one led by supporters of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> violated party rules. The competing delegate lists now must be reviewed by the party's `` contest committee,'' which reports to the national convention's credentials From there, the party has a mechanism for choosing between competing delegate slates and hearing appeals of those decisions.

<HEAD>Restrictions on Water Use are Spotty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Drought-Heat Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Hot summer weather and a widespread drought have strained the resources of many city water systems, but the impact has been spotty. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> draws water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and has no worries about supply, while suburban <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> has shut off service to eight customers within the past week as part of a get-tough conservation policy. Farmers and ranchers around <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, are petitioning for federal drought relief, but in the city, `` we've got enough water to last five years,'' said Utilities Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>. Officials in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, say water supplies are adequate, but water use in the northwest section and some suburbs is restricted because the distribution system ca n't meet summer demand. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> faces the second straight year of below-normal water supplies, and the city implemented voluntary conservation measures in April. Decorative fountains and ponds that do not use recycled water have been turned off, water may not be used to wash sidewalks or other paved areas, restaurants may only serve water on request and leaks must be repaired in a timely manner. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> approved a penalty system that will sharply increase rates for households that use more water than alloted. In <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, a homeowner was fined for $ 155 for wasting water _ the first such enforcement action since a 1977 drought. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON> last week placed water use restrictions on all surface water systems and some ground water systems north of a line extending from <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. Several communities already have restricted water use. `` We told them about where we see the drought going and that we expected July and August to get worse,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Word </PERSON>. Last week, four <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> communities _ <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Waterford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> _ began alternate-day watering restrictions. Enforcement has been helped, officials said, by hundreds of calls from neighbors. `` We laugh about it,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Beanblossom </PERSON>, assistant utility manager in <LOCATION> Waterford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. `` We say, ` Here comes another squealer.''' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> on Tuesday directed state agencies to stop unnecessary use of water and called for voluntary, statewide conservation. `` It appears that <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> may be in for a season-long, statewide drought,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said after receiving a report from a federal-state inter-agency drought task force. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, open fire hydrants have sapped supplies, <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. With heat in the 90s, hydrants are frequently opened in poorer neighborhoods to provide a cooling splash for kids. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said more than 1,000 of the city's 26,000 hydrants had been illegally opened Tuesday, when water usage jumped to nearly 500 million gallons _ 150 million above average. City officials were making available cap sprinklers that can be fitted onto hydrants, to be turned on by fire department officials. In nearby <LOCATION> Quakertown </LOCATION>, non-essential water use _ lawns, car-washing and swimming pools _ was banned on Tuesday, Borough Manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Woglom </PERSON> announced. In <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, the 100,000 residents are forbidden to water outdoors between noon and 7 p.m. and may use their hoses only every other day. Still, said City Commissioner <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, well levels are dropping. `` I would n't be the least bit surprised to see more dramatic steps within the next couple of days. By that I mean a total ban,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed substantially higher today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while share prices declined for the fourth consecutive trading day. The dollar closed at 128.55 yen, up a strong 0.95 yen from Wednesday's finish. It had opened the day, however, up more than two yen at 129.80, the currency's highest level in nearly four months, and briefly touched a low of 128.25. Traders attributed the dollar's decline after an initial surge to profit taking by institutional investors. `` Investors who had purchased the dollar earlier decided to collect profits on the higher dollar,'' said a foreign exchange dealer with a major <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trading became quiet in the afternoon as dealers, concerned the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would step into the market to stem the further rise of the dollar, stepped aside, he said. The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank does not officially comment on its market activity. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 64.79-point loser Wednesday, lost another 127.85 points, or 0.46 percent, to finish the day's session at 27,732.93. `` A wait-and-see attitude among investors coupled with profit-taking share selling pulled the Nikkei index back,'' said a stock analyst with a major securities house, who also demanded anonymity. Encouraged by the strong dollar and overnight advance on Wall Street, the Nikkei Index, the stock market's key barometer, rose to a high of around 28,008 points, up about 147 points at one time during the morning trading, dealers said. The brokerage official said that except for certain large-capitals, most issues were either finished lower or remained unchanged as investors became worried about inflation and higher interest rates in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The strong dollar caused Japanese government bond prices to fall, driving up yields and concern about domestic interest rates, traders said. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares, down from 1.2 billion shares Wednesday. Losers include chemicals, automobiles and financials. Some of the large-capital steels and machineries finished higher.

 Defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> allegedly arranged for high-level <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to smuggle classified documents out of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and allow him to copy the papers with the help of his wife, according to a published report today. Citing unnamed government sources, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> allegedly passed sensitive information to his major client, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which paid him what one source described as `` staggering fees'' as a consultant. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was retained by the defense contracting firm the day he left his post as assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on March 31, 1987, according to the Times. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s close deputy in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one of six <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials stripped of access to secret documents Tuesday, is suspected of being a major supplier of the classified materials, according to a document in the investigation, the Times reported. Sources familiar with the investigation told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is cooperating with government investigators. The investigation that surfaced last week involves allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. The details on <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> cited by the Times are the most detailed yet on how investigators believe the alleged scheme worked. The Times quoted sources who said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> recommended <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> hire Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, retired commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, whose offices were the target of a search warrant last week, to assist in the effort to sell the company's F-18 fighter-bomber to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> went to work last December to with <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> on the effort. The warrant served in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> seeks a wide range of documents `` relating to the work of Ace <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> from December, 1987, through 1988.'' <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, said Wednesday it would be `` premature to make any comment. There is nothing specific from the prosecutors to comment on.'' `` This case is still in the evidence-gathering stage,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s involvement in the sale of F-18s to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, was a major focus of a warrant the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> obtained last week to search the office of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, the firm's marketing vice president, at the company's <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> headquarters The search warrant said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> `` has provided <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> substantial information obtained from government officials which has been classified and @ or confidential or not available to the contracting public.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a spokesman in <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, repeated a statement the company issued last week when <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>'s office was searched. `` We are not aware of any improper requests by the company to Mr. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> or any improper activities by Mr. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> on behalf of the company,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, who was deputy assistant secretary for acquisition until he was reassigned Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, was regarded as a key aide to <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> when both were at the Pentagon.

 A political consultant faces a possible 38-year prison term after being convicted of gathering forged signatures on petitions that put <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> on the state's Republican presidential primary ballot Rocky Mountain and his <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> each were convicted Wednesday on 38 counts of misdemeanor forgery for directing workers to put phony signatures, including those of two dead people, on the petitions that qualified the former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> governor for the March primary. For each count, the 27-year-old Mountain faces fines of up to $ 2,000 and one year in prison. Southern Political Consulting faces fines of up to $ 10,000 per count for a potential total of $ 380,000. The punishment phase was set for today. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> staged a Dec. 19 `` forgery party'' at his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office, complete with beer for underage drinkers, to get the signatures needed for du Pont. Jurors deliberated almost four hours before reaching the verdict. <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> said he was disappointed, but reserved further comment until after sentencing. He stood motionless as <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court-at-Law </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> read the long series of guilty verdicts. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>, president of Southern Political, stood with his arms folded and eyes looking down as <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> read the verdicts against the firm. Mountain, a vice president of the Houston-based firm, was hired by the du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> campaign to gather the 5,000 signatures needed to get on the ballot. In convicting Mountain, jurors rejected the defense argument that he ordered temporary workers to sign phony signatures only because he had been goaded by a du Pont official for being unable to collect legitimate ones. Mountain testified he never intended for the du Pont campaign to submit the phony petitions. The six-member jury also rejected the argument that <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> was working as a du Pont volunteer, not a company employee, when he ordered the forgeries. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and his campaign officials have denied knowledge of the forgeries. No one from the du Pont campaign testified here. `` Was there an intent to defraud or harm? I do n't think so,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, Mountain's lawyer, said in Wednesday's closing argument. `` Rocky Mountain -LRB- was -RRB- hacked off and he -LRB- did -RRB- something stupid.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> told jurors, `` There was harm, folks. `` He lied to you. He lied,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>'s claim that he did not intend to deceive anyone. Seven people testified <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> bought them beer and showed them how to forge signatures on the petitions. Thirty-five witnesses, whose names appeared on the petitions, testified they had not signed the petitions. Another witness said the signature of his mother, a nursing home resident, looked phony. Testimony also showed that the signatures of two dead people were on the du Pont petitions.

 High school cheerleaders hanged black banners in the town square in memory of two sisters and five of their children killed when a train struck their car at a rural crossing that lacked warning signals. `` It's a major catastrophe for <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, city editor of the <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION> Register, the newspaper in the town of 7,000 people. `` There's shock.

Her sister, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 26, was a homecoming queen and graduated in 1980. Both were honor students. The collision occurred Tuesday near <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION>, about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION>. A paramedic collapsed and died trying to save one of the children. `` It just stunned us,'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Friskel </PERSON>, the mother and grandmother of the victims, said Wednesday. `` You just ca n't expect it. To have it happen to so many of our children and their children. And all at once. You never think it's going to happen.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Friskel </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, are co-owners of <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION>'s funeral home and will handle the services All seven people in the station wagon were killed, including Mrs. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' children, <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>, 8, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON>, 3, and Mrs. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s children, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, 2. In addition, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, 48, director of the <LOCATION> Crawford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ambulance service, died of a heart attack while trying to resuscitate one of the victims at a <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION> hospital. `` I'm sure there have been a lot of tears shed in this community, even by people who may not have known them all that well, because this strikes real close to home,'' said <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carder </PERSON>. Officials investigating the accident said Mrs. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was driving, either did not see the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern freight train or tried to race it to the crossing. `` As far as we can determine ... there was no attempt -LRB- by the driver -RRB- to avoid the accident,'' said Trooper <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, who spent Wednesday reconstructing the accident. The car left no skid marks and did not veer as it approached the crossing, which had no signals, lights or arms, but was in a clear intersection. Two double-fatality accidents have occurred there since 1978. The engineer was cleared of any responsibility in the accident, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He was driving the southbound train 10 miles below the 55 mph speed limit. The engineer sounded his whistle before reaching the crossing, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He put on the emergency brakes when he saw the station wagon, but the switching engine and seven freight cars required at least a quarter-mile to stop. `` There's probably nothing more of a nightmare than -LRB- an engineer -RRB- seeing a loaded car on a railroad crossing,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern spokeswoman. `` It's always emotionally difficult.

<HEAD>Ailing Mathematician Receives Unofficial Word He Can Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ailing Jewish mathematician who has tried in vain to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for more than nine years said today that officials had told him they no longer object to his emigration. But refusenik <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>, 50, said he still had not received official permission to join relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said he received a telephone call Wednesday from his former workplace telling him that the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> that oversees it no longer objects to his emigrating. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview from his <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, home Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials called to say they had been informed <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> would be allowed to leave. Asked about the reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said that because of the high official sources, `` I think it is so.'' However, he said in a telephone interview that he had no official confirmation from the Soviet visa office. If they are given permission to leave, <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said he and his wife <PERSON> Yadviga </PERSON> would join relatives near <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In another long-time refusenik case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also said that <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> and their 11-year-old daughter <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> would be allowed to emigrate. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> considered visiting the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> family during his trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said he did not because high-ranking Soviet officials told them the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> family never would be allowed to emigrate if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited them. If the <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> families are allowed to leave, it would resolve two of best-known refusenik cases. Beginning last year, Soviet officials increased Jewish emigration and have allowed most of the best-known refuseniks to leave. But Jewish activists claim thousands of those who have not attracted media attention remain behind and the Soviet system still violates their rights to emigration by applying unreasonable state secrecy criteria and demanding waivers of financial responsibilty from relatives who stay behind. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> was refused permission to leave because of calculations on trajectories of space flight he did between 1966 and 1971. He had surgery eight years ago to remove a cancerous tumor, and said he needs surgery for another tumor on his neck. He also suffered a heart attack recently and said he needs medical treatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Three arms dealers were convicted of plotting to illegally ship military equipment to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in what authorities said was the first racketeering prosecution of an arms export case. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury returned the verdict Wednesday and was to meet today to decide on forfeiture of the $ 1 million in illegal profits from the deals, which included the shipment of 1,300 night-vision goggles to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The three main defendants _ <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Monsey </LOCATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> HLB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisbona </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> HLB </ORGANIZATION> employee _ were found guilty of all charges. They were convicted of 13 counts, including racketeering, wire fraud, violations of federal export law, conspiracy and making false statements to a governmental agency. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> also were convicted of obstruction of justice. The most serious charge, racketeering, carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A fourth defendant, <PERSON> Grim </PERSON> <PERSON> DePancicis </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, an associate of <ORGANIZATION> HLB </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted of aiding an illegal export and conspiracy in connection with the Soviet deal but was acquitted of a charge alleging his involvement in the Argentine shipment. In that deal, the military equipment was smuggled out of the country without a required export license by couriers who hid the goggles in luggage, prosecutors said. Another deal involved a shipment of 110 boxes of handguns, shotguns and ammunition that the government contends was destined for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> but was seized by authorities in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. A third illegal export was a `` sting'' by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to ship 400 night-vision devices to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. One sample was smuggled out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without an export license to a post office box in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The last deal involved a shipment of 500 automatic rifles, ammunition and other weapons that had an export license for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but was to go to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the indictment said. The arms were seized at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in February 1984 and the defendants were charged soon after. The defendants used two means to arrange the deals, which took place between 1982 and 1984, prosecutors said during the three-month trial: They either did not obtain export licenses as required for arms shipments or used licenses for a shipment to a legal destination but had the arms sent elsewhere. Defense attorneys denied their clients had committed any illegal actions and said that all the transactions were carried out openly because the defendants had nothing to hide. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> testified that the Polish shipment was arranged to establish routine business dealings in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to facilitate the possible purchase of two Soviet tanks wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials. He said he was sought out by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 and later had contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> concerning the purchase of two Soviet T-72 tanks. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON> said the prosecution was the first time the federal racketeering statute was used in an illegal arms export case. He said it was alleged the defendants made about $ 1 million from the four deals.

<HEAD>More Beer Bars to Open As Anti-Booze Campaign Finds Moderation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City officials have approved plans to open 133 new bars, automatic dispensers and restaurants to sell beer as part of a more balanced approach to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-alcohol campaign, a newspaper reported. But <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in an article in its Wednesday editions that Muscovites still have to be lucky to find a bottle of beer anywhere. The newspaper said the city government's decision to allow beer sales in more places is a `` step toward a more considered approach to the struggle with drunkenness and alcoholism.'' `` Life showed that this problem can not be solved only with prohibitive measures,'' it said. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city officials also ordered a 19 percent increase in beer production this year, but <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said breweries can not meet their deliveries because of a shortage of bottles. And more than a month after city officials ordered the establishment of bars, restaurants and dispensers to sell beer, there is no sign of them. Moscow News said officials set no time limit to fulfill the order. In one of his first major acts after becoming <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary in 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cracked down on drinking. The drinking age was raised, prices of alcoholic beverages went up and the hours of liquor stores were restricted. Soviet officials credit the campaign with improving worker discipline and improving public health, but there also has been increasing criticism. Consumers often have to stand in long lines to buy a bottle of vodka or wine, and moonshining has contributed to a sugar shortage.

<HEAD>Irish Eyes Are Cryin' For Tenor Dennis Day, Who Died at Age 71</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a golden-voiced <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> balladeer whose career as a foil for comedian <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> spanned decades of radio, television and film, has died after a long battle with <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease. He was 71. Day died at his Bel Air home late Wednesday, surrounded by his 10 children and 13 grandchildren, said his publicist, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Everyone is taking it very hard,'' she said. His wife, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the day for cardiac tests and was in stable condition, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauthier </PERSON> Doctors have not confirmed whether she suffered a heart attack, Ms. <PERSON> Gauthier </PERSON> said. The cause of death was not determined, but Day was diagnosed last year as suffering from amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a progressive muscular ailment that killed <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>. He had undergone brain surgery in March after suffering a fall, and was readmitted to St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s on June 5, the hospital said. He was released from the hospital Monday. `` I'm very, very saddened by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' death,'' said comedian <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which Day supported. `` <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> was a brave, kind, talented man who showed his love by giving. All you had to do was ask.'' Day's career spanned decades in radio, television and movies, and he was rated as one of the shrewdest talents in the business. Born <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> to Irish parents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on May 21, 1917, he was graduated from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> with plans to enter <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION>'s law school His plans changed when <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> was hunting for a singer to replace <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. A recording Day had made earned him an audition, and an off-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job, according to a studio biography. With all the applicants gathered in an audition room, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> called out, `` Oh <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>!'' Young <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, please.'' `` That's it!'' <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> whooped. He assumed the name <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> when he joined <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s radio show as a singer in 1939, and quickly matured into a comic target for the host. One of Day's trademark lines was a sprightly, `` Gee, Mr. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>!'' With a nationwide audience on radio, Day gained popularity with his renditions of `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON> Lowered the Boom,'' and other ballads. Another Day favorite, `` Peg of my Heart'' was a ballad he sang for his wife, said Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. In 1952, Day disclosed that <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> authorities had banned his RCA recording of `` The St. Patrick's Day Parade.'' `` The Irish did n't object to the song or to my singing,'' Day said, but to shouted exlamations such as `` How are ye, <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON>, me boy!'' as if he were marching in a parade. `` They said -LRB- it -RRB- sounded like stage Irish,'' Day said at the time, with some bemusement. Day moved to television with <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s show in 1950, making irregular appearances. In 1951, Day demonstrated his business acumen by landing a movie contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he was the only <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> contract player with television rights. He also signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, after allowing weeks of bidding between the network and competitor CBS. Day became a regular on such TV variety shows as `` All Star Revue,'' `` Hour Glass,'' `` The RCA Victor Show,'' `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> Presents'' and his own `` Dennis Day Show.'' He also appeared in several films, including `` Buck Benny Rides Again,'' `` Music in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>,'' `` One Sunday Afternoon'' and `` The Girl Next Door.'' In their later years, the Days divided their time between their Bel Air home and a second home in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. He enjoyed horseback riding and sailing. During a vacation in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last year, Day became aware of a muscle-control problem and returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, where doctors diagnosed ALS. Day's publicist said that though he was confined to a wheelchair, he continued to make appearances at Irish fairs and medical benefits. `` Up to the end there, he was still doing benefits. After he found out that he had ALS he said that he wanted to do as much for this research group as possible,'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEAD>Striking Scriptwriters Vote On Contract In Heated Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Striking scriptwriters packed meeting halls on both coasts to vote on the latest contract offer in heated meetings that could decide the outcome to the 16-week-old walkout tonight. <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> urged their membership Wednesday night to reject the $ 71 million contract offered last week by producers. Dissident writers, eager for a settlement, called for its approval. A similar meeting took place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Results of the vote were to be announced late today. Union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> called the balloting critical, saying it would determine `` how we're going to deal with the whole industry in the future.'' The guild struck March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns of one-hour domestic television shows and a bigger share in the increased foreign market. The union also sought better guidelines to protect a writer's work and allow writers to re-acquire unproduced scripts. Agreement was reached on matters of creative control, but both sides remain divided on the rerun economic package. Originally, officials had hoped to announce results after the vote Wednesday night, but the overwhelming response slowed the tabulation, an official said. Guild Executive Director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> refused to speculate on how the vote would go. `` I do n't know how big the vote will be to accept or reject. ... I do n't know how big the divisions really are,'' said <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, who received a standing ovation during a nearly hour-long presentation advocating rejection of the contract. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinn </PERSON>, a member of the pro-settlement <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, told the audience, `` This industry feeds on us, and we feed on it.'' He challenged the strategy suppositions made by <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and the union leadership, telling union members, `` There is one thing that is absolutely definite ... there is a contract here that can get us back to work in two days. That is a fact, that's not anyone's supposition. The union has about 9,500 members nationwide, about 6,000 on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Members of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> suggested that if they could get 30 percent of the vote they would have shown enough strength to change conditions and force a quick settlement. But <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> disputed that claim, saying a 70 percent showing for support after four months of striking would be a strong statement for the union stance.

<HEAD>Governing Party's Split Widens With Choice Of Second Presidential

<TEXT>
 A faction of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has nominated a second presidential candidate for next year's elections, further widening the split in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s top political party. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> was chosen unanimously Wednesday by 180 national delegates who gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, 48, is the former minister of the presidency and communications under President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed government. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, a businessman and former foreign minister under <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, was nominated by the party's other faction on April 29. <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prendes </LOCATION>, 55, has said he will take the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In comments to journalists Tuesday, he called <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> `` a thief.'' Each faction considers the other's convention illegal. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, honorary party president, called last month for both hopefuls to step aside to make way for a unity candidate in the March 1989 election. By law, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> can not run for reelection. The president is being treated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for terminal cancer, though his son has said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> will resume his duties in July. The bitter infighting has further hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, soundly defeated as they were by the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish acronym as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, in municipal and legislative elections in March. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has had an elected civilian government since 1982, but leftist rebels contend it is only a facade for dictatorial military rule. They accuse rightist death squads and paramilitary forces of killing civilians. The civil war that has claimed 65,000 lives since October 1979 is generally considered to be stalemated, but guerrilla leaders recently pledged to step up their military campaign.

 A woman wanted for investigation in a fatal 1980 letter-bombing was arrested as she entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was jailed pending a bail hearing, officials said. <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, 48, was arrested Wednesday as she stepped off a jetliner following a flight from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where she had been living as a fugitive, authorities said. She appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who ordered her held. Ms. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, who holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, was charged with conpiracy to mail an explosive device and with aiding in the mailing of the device on July 17, 1980, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said she also was questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and postal inspectors about the Oct. 11, 1985, letter bombing of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rights leader <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> office.

But, he added, the sending of the explosive device did not appear to be politically motivated.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has reinstated a lawsuit filed by entertainer <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> after an advertising agency allegedly tried to duplicate her voice and singing style in one of its ad campaigns. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> unanimously ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> could pursue her suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency. The court said certain personal attributes _ such as a voice _ can be considered property rights, protected by state law. The television ad campaign featured one of <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s former backup signers performing `` Do You Want To Dance'' in an ad for the Mercury Sable car. The agency's ads included nine original singers and 10 `` sound-alikes'' for its series, the court said. After being turned down by <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s manager, the agency contacted <PERSON> Uta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedwig </PERSON>, who once sang backup for <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>, and asked her to imitate <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s voice, the court said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rubicam </PERSON> acted like `` the average thief'' but dismissed <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s suit, saying no law prohibits imitation of a singer's voice. But the appeals court disagreed. `` A voice is as distinctive and personal as a face,'' the appeals court said. `` When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs.'' A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the ad agency did not return telephone calls Wednesday.

But the appeals court disagreed. `` A voice is as distinctive and personal as a face,'' the appeals court said. `` When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs.'' A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the ad agency did not return telephone calls Wednesday.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Its Warplanes Bombed 10 Oil Targets In Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes today bombed 10 oil production installations and pumping stations in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the heaviest air raids on Iranian economic targets in weeks, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said six targets in the <LOCATION> Ahwaz </LOCATION> oilfields in southwestern <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province were hit and caught fire. Soon after, two installations at the <LOCATION> Bibi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hakimah </LOCATION> oilfield, 120 miles to the southeast were bombed and set ablaze, <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Another formation of jets hit the Kagsaran terminal on the northern coast of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at about the same time, leaving the targets shrouded in flames and smoke, the agency said. All the planes returned safely to their bases, <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> added. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims could not be independently confirmed. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military communique as saying the raids were a message to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that `` it has lost the war in all fields and that there is no alternative to save <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from total deterioration but to accept peace.'' Today's air raids were the first significant strikes against Iranian oil installations on land since early May, when fighter-bombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemical plants. The air force has also attacked several Iranian oil tankers in the gulf a bit to choke off the vital oil exports <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> needs to finance its war effort. French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1s carried out a long-range 1,500-mile raid on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal in the southern gulf on May 14, setting five tankers on fire. The targets included the world's largest vessel, the 564,739-ton Seawise Giant. Iraqi air strikes inflicted considerable damage on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil infrastructure in March and April, oil industry and diplomatic sources reported. Refineries were repeatedly hit. Oil industry sources say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been forced to import unprecedented amounts of refined products, such as aviation fuel and kerosene, because refinery production has been badly reduced. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s air force has been concentrating on attacking Iranian troop concentrations in the last few weeks as the land war heated up. Both sides have claimed to have killed or wounded thousands of each other's troops in various sectors of the 730-mile front. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980.

<TEXT>
 The former ticket manager for the 1988 Winter Olympics in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> has been convicted and sentenced to five years in jail on charges involving early ticket sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A jury of eight men and four women returned the guilty verdict Wednesday against <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, 39. He was sentenced later in the day. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> was charged after he sold about 1,200 tickets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through his company, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tickets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The charges included two of fraud, two of theft, one count of forgery, one of dealing with a forged document and one of mischief. During the 11-day trial, the <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bench </LOCATION> court heard evidence that <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> altered 10,000 Olympic ticket forms so that payment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars went to his company, instead of Olympic organizers. The prosecution said <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> stood to make more than $ 1.6 million by the time he was charged, Americans had sent almost $ 1 million with 1,200 Olympic order forms to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tickets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Organizers said they caught the irregularities in time to make sure all legitimate ticket orders were filled On Wednesday, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>'s members wept and embraced him after hearing Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dea </PERSON>'s sentence. Outside the court, <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said his brother acted in the interests of the Olympic organizing committee and the public. `` We know there was no intent on <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s part to do anything but protect the interests of everyone who was applying to take part in the initial ticket allocation,'' he told reporters.

<HEAD>Study: Human Ancestors Ate Softer Foods Than Evolutionary Cousins

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study of ancient teeth suggests ancestors of humans ate soft fruits and leaves but their evolutionary cousins ate nuts and bark, scientists reported today. The study compared microscopic wear patterns of teeth from human ancestors called <LOCATION> Australopithecus </LOCATION> and their `` cousins,'' called <LOCATION> Paranthropus </LOCATION>, with those of modern animals with known diets. The work is reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Grine </PERSON>, associate professor of anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, professor of anatomy at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. They studied detailed replicas of molars that <PERSON> Australopithecus </PERSON> left some 2.5 million to 2.8 million years ago in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Paranthropus </PERSON> left there some 1.5 million to 1.8 million years ago. The two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust australopithecines, respectively. Both walked upright, but after their lineages split some 2.5 million years ago, the Australopithecus group evolved toward modern humans while the <LOCATION> Paranthropus </LOCATION> branch eventually died out. In the study, Paranthropus teeth showed more pits, and wider pits and scratches, suggesting a diet of tougher foods than Australopithecus ate, researchers said. The difference probably led to the bigger teeth and larger jaws of <LOCATION> Paranthropus </LOCATION>, they said.

<HEAD>Continent's Oldest Well-Preserved Fossils of Land Vertebrates

<TEXT>
 Scientists today reported finding <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest well-preserved fossils of land-dwelling vertebrates, and said the find should yield important information about early species of such animals. Several hundred fossils have been collected in southeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> from what was apparently a pond when the animals lived 335 million years ago, scientists said in today's issue of the British journal Nature. News of the fossils had been publicized in 1986. The Nature report was written by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Witzke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resouces </ORGANIZATION>, and M.P. <ORGANIZATION> McAdams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oskaloosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The ancient animals lived 15 million years after amphibians appeared on the scene. The fossils include nearly complete skeletons of at least two apparently new species of amphibians, including one related to ancient animals called anthracosaurs, researchers said. At least eight fish species are also represented, they said. The find is important, partly because it is the first such site of the Mississippian age reported from the middle of the continent, <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> wrote in an editorial accompanying the report.

<HEAD>Study Finds AIDS Infections Among Emergency Room Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emergency room workers should handle all blood as though it's tainted with the AIDS virus because of the risk of patients having unrecognized AIDS infections, a report today concludes. The researchers found that at one inner city emergency room, 4 percent of the patients were infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, but did not know it. Their report concludes that `` infection-control precautions should be consistently applied, particularly in emergency settings, by all health care workers coming in contact with blood or other body fluids, whether HIV infection is known or suspected, and regardless of patients' condition at presentation or knowledge of their risk-factor status.'' The report, published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, is based on a survey of 2,302 emergency room patients who were treated over a six-week period last year at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. HIV infection was most common among black men between ages 30 and 34. The survey found that 11 percent of them carried the virus. Three-quarters of the emergency room patients were black. The doctors wrote that the high infection rate `` may reflect the rapid spread of HIV into the local inner city, predominantly black population.'' The risk of hospital workers catching AIDS from the patients is considered to be very low. Nevertheless, experts recommend that doctors, nurses and technicians take special precautions when handling the blood of AIDS-infected patients to eliminate even this low risk. The researchers said that during the period studied, only 27 patients who were already known to be infected were treated with special precautions. Their blood was labeled infectious, and health care workers wore gloves when performing procedures or handling blood. After medical evaluations, the examining rooms were cleaned with disinfectant.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers accepted company-proposed wage increases today and formally ended a 26-day strike. Both company and labor union officials said the company's plant in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> would resume production later today after preparation and cleaning. `` The settlement is not 100 percent satisfactory, but I am sure most members would understand what we have achieved,'' said union leader <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yung-bok </PERSON>. Company president <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang-sup </PERSON> welcomed the settlement and said, `` All <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials and workers would do our best to make up for lost production.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> said the strike cost $ 490 million in lost sales. The settlement will give workers an immediate pay increase of $ 106 a month. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> workers earn an average of $ 800 a month after five years, including allowances. Union leaders called off the strike Monday, indicating the company had assured them considerable pay hikes if their boycott ended voluntarily. The union's decision prompted <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> to announce the reopening of its plant on Tuesday. But the plant failed to reopen Tuesday as union leaders changed their mind and made a new demand for payment of lost wages during the strike. The company rejected the union demand but offered a one-shot payment of $ 206 to `` encourage workers to work harder to increase production.'' The union accepted the offer. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> planned to produce 720,000 vehicles this year and export two-thirds of them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries.

 At least 63 people were injured today when hundreds of rival <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and followers clashed with clubs and rocks over the leadership of a temple. Witnesses said fierce fighting broke out shortly after midnight, when about 150 monks, helped by followers armed with clubs, iron bars and rocks, stormed the <ORGANIZATION> Bongun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to drive out rival monks. Local news reports said clashes contined for three hours before dawn as about 100 monks barricaded the temple and resisted with rocks and clubs, injuring 13 people on both sides. In the end, the attacking faction took over the temple. Early today, monks driven out in the initial clashes returned to the scene with about 100 followers and tried to recapture the shrine, triggering another free-for-all, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. Some followers used tear gas guns and knives, and clashes involving fists and clubs went on for four more hours, injuring 50 more people, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. About 300 riot police deployed around the temple stayed away during the free-for-all. The Bongun dispute dates back to April 13, when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> sect, Chokye, tried to replace the head priest of the temple His followers disobeyed the reshuffle order.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Active Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in active European trading this morning, supported by widespread bullish sentiment. Gold prices were lower, depressed by the dollar's strength. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was buoyed by the recent improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and indications that world monetary authorities are n't overly concerned about a stronger dollar. The dollar started the European day on a very bullish note in hectic trading dominated by buyers. The market then calmed down a bit, with more regular two-way trading. One Italian trader said central bank intervention against the dollar's rise had been minimal, effectively giving the market a green light to take the dollar higher. `` The dollar is on a forward march,'' a trader at a West German bank in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION> said. `` The mood is confident.'' But another dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar's near-term direction is n't yet clear `` The market is still unsure whether the trend will continue upwards or whether there will be some profit-taking,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.95 yen to a closing 128.55 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 128.93 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's rates: _ 1.7865 West German marks, up from 1.7740 _ 1.4802 Swiss francs, up from 1.4720 _ 6.0285 French francs, up from 5.9747 _ 2.0094 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9975 _ 1,325.25 Italian lire, up from 1,314.50 _ 1.2070 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2100 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the It cost $ 1.7648 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7710 late Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 448.40 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 447.60. Both were down from Wednesday's late bid of $ 448.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 447.80, down from $ 448.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.68 to close at a bid $ 449.78.

 A former state highway patrolman faces possible life imprisonment for strangling a motorist whose death exposed his habit of stopping young female drivers for lingering talks in the dark. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol officer for 13 years, was convicted Wednesday in his second trial for the on-duty murder of <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>. A prosecution case strengthened through hindsight and the inability of the defense to establish an alibi were the chief reasons cited by lawyers for the jury's first-degree murder finding after five days of deliberations. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s first trial ended with a hung jury Feb. 25. `` Holes closed in the second trial,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` The jury came to the conclusion that there was an overwhelming abundance of evidence. I think what we've demonstrated is the system works, justice has been served, and no one is above the law,'' he said. Regarded as an exemplary officer before his Jan. 15, 1987, arrest, <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> was fired after an internal investigation. He is appealing the firing. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> was the second officer in the 58-year history of the agency to be charged with killing a motorist while on duty. `` He is crushed. He wants to appeal,'' said <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> was convicted of strangling <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student, after pulling her car over on Dec. 27, 1986, as she drove home along Interstate 15. <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>'s abandoned car was found in a cul-de-sac near an offramp of I-15, and her body was found in a creek bed beneath an old highway bridge nearby. She had been strangled before being thrown off the 65-foot bridge. <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> was described by the prosecutor as a careful young woman who was trained in self-defense and who may have grown suspicious of <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s actions and prompted him to kill her. During retrial, jurors heard testimony from 121 prosecution witnesses, including two dozen women motorists who recalled their encounters with <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>. The former officer never made any sexual advances, and was described by some as helpful and polite while others said they were scared and uncomfortable. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for July 20, and <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> faces a prison term of 25 years to life. <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said he would appeal the verdict at the sentencing. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>, who was free on $ 250,000 bail, was taken into custody immediately after the verdict. `` We recognize the extraordinary courage of the witnesses who came forward and through their soul-searching revealed the truth,'' said <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. `` We put our trust in the criminal justice system and feel justice has finally been served.'' <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, vowed to stand by her husband. `` As a family, we're sticking together side by side,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Peyer </PERSON> said outside the couple's house. `` It's a really tough time for us, but we always remain a family and I trust totally in the Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>China Says Proposals By Dalai Lama Are Unacceptable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today rejected a proposal made by <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, that would have recognized its control of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign affairs in exchange for limited independence for the remote region Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, at a weekly briefing, said it was `` irrefutable'' that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. `` Therefore, to have independence or semi-independence will go nowhere in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. It is not tolerable or acceptable and even a sort of independence in a disguised form is not acceptable,'' he said. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled to exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after a failed 1959 uprising against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, made the proposal last week in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It was significant in that it acknowledged Chinese interests in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and granted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the right to keep troops in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and run the region's foreign affairs. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said he proposed a `` middle way'' in which <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> would be a self-governing entity in association with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The proposal was seen as a major concession by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who in the past has called for the total independence of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Last fall and again in March monks loyal to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> led bloody anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. Sources in the Office of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said many Tibetans were unhappy with the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s new proposal and had hoped he would not give in to the Chinese. In his <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> speech, the exiled <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> leader acknowledged his proposal might be controversial within the Tibetan community. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> today accused the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> of attempting to internationalize the <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> question. `` We oppose any action or activities to be taken by <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> in foreign countries which are detrimental to the unification of the motherland and the national unity,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> spiritual leader made his proposal during a private visit to the European Parliament in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>. He was not invited to address the body because of the parliament's concern for maintaining good relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. After the speech, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> canceled several visits to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> planned by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> strongly criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for inviting the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> to testify on conditions in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> last fall, shortly before the outbreak of rioting in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. `` We are also opposed to any foreign organizations or personage who provides a forum for Dalai Lama to make statements which are detrimental to national unity,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Asked if there were any good points in the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s proposal, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> would only say that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> `` is entirely a matter of the Chinese internal affairs.

<TEXT>
 Scientists, medicine men and farmers have long sought ways to make it rain on command. While that day may be nearer, rainmaking can not yet offer hope for breaking the drought gripping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Experiments have shown that cloud seeding `` can offer a modest increase in what precipitation does fall, but it would not break a drought or anything like that,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poellot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION>. Studies `` suggest man's ability to modify precipitation is really quite minor,'' added <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braham </PERSON>, who teaches meteorology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not dealing with a minor problem in the drought, we're dealing with a major catastrophe,'' <PERSON> Braham </PERSON> said `` There's no reason to think cloud seeding could do anything to ameliorate the dry conditions that we have.'' Even <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Atmospherics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the nation's largest cloud-seeding company, conceded that `` weather modification, as a cure-all for drought situations, is probably not a very viable technology.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Boe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which operates a weather modification program in that state, held out hope that `` something can be done.'' But, he noted, `` in a drought, the opportunities are less.'' Seeding `` might shorten the length of a drought a bit, but you will not see a dramatic result from it in most cases.'' he said. Poellot reported that cloud-seeding experiments have increased rainfall by as much as 10 percent. But, he noted, `` for cloud seeding to work, it needs some clouds. So if there are no clouds, you're out of luck.'' That same thought was echoed by the other meteorologists. `` The atmosphere just does not have any clouds in it; we've been totally cloud free,'' <PERSON> Braham </PERSON> said. `` We've been in the field since June 1, but we've flown very litte,'' added <PERSON> Boe </PERSON>, whose agency operates an airborne cloud-seeding program covering 6.6 million acres of western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> spends about $ 1.5 million per two-year budget cycle on weather modification, half from the state and half from a tax voted by residents of the counties affected. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said that the cost of running a commercial four-month summertime cloud-seeding program covering 3,000 to 5,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> would typically run from $ 100,000 to $ 125,000. Making it rain has obsessed mankind for thousands of years, and many hoped for a breakthrough a few decades ago when the first successes were achieved. In 1946, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> accomplished the goal, although he actually made it snow, rather than rain. Through the centuries, all sorts of less scientific methods had been attempted, including animal sacrifice, setting out pots of water, calling on various gods, clashing armor, ringing church bells and even firing artillery into the sky. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, in a famous Nov. 13, 1946, experiment near <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, sprinkled three pounds of ground dry ice into a cloud and within minutes snowflakes formed, and a hole appeared in the cloud. A lot of experimentation was done in the 1970s, sponsored by state and federal governments, but there has been relatively little scientific work on changing the weather in the 1980s. That is partly because of reductions in money available for the work and partly because `` the scientists succeeded in defining the situations where rainfall increases looked feasible and those where it did n't look so feasible, and the window of opportunity kept getting smaller and smaller,'' <PERSON> Braham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boe </PERSON> stressed that any cloud-seeding program has to be a continuing one. `` If you're going to start a weather modification program to deal with drought, and when it's over you bag the program, you're taking the wrong tack,'' he said Long-term cloud seeding adds to the deep ground moisture, and can help resist the damage of droughts.

<TEXT>
 Newly elected Prime Minsiter Do <PERSON> Muoi </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> is trying to end its international isolation by seeking to end its 9-year-old military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> radio quoted Do Muoi as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> may withdraw all of its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> before 1990. According to the broadcast, <PERSON> Do </PERSON> <PERSON> Muoi </PERSON> said that `` to widen cooperation, first of all, it is necessary to maintain peace and security. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is striving to solve the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue.'' Do Muoi, 71, was elected on Wednesday. Many non-communist Western and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries have denied economic aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and otherwise isolated the communist nation to protest its late 1978 invasion and continuing occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will remove all its estimated 120,000 troops by 1990, and plans a pullout of about 50,000 troops this year. Today's announcement was the first time a Vietnamese leader said the withdrawal could be completed before that date. Hanoi-based diplomats say that under a new pragmatic leadership that has given top priority to economic development, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has made a series of diplomatic initiatives on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which not long ago was a non-negotiable issue. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> recently decided to send Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> to attend unprecedented peace talks involving Cambodian guerrilla factions next month in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. In a speech Wednesday, Do Muoi pledged to continue <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Western-style economic reforms to revive an economy Communist authorities said they weakened through indecisiveness and poor planning An official Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> report seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today quoted Do Muoi as telling the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> he will `` thoroughly grasp the renovative spirit'' of resolutions adopted at a December 1986 party congress. The resolutions liberalized <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s economy by allowing a measure of free enterprise and opening up the country to foreign investment. In a report to the assembly Wednesday, <PERSON> Vo </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiet </PERSON>, the acting premier, said people were `` deeply worried'' about rampant inflation, chaos in the distribution of goods and acute food shortages in the northern provinces. Vietnamese sources had said Do Muoi was the most likely choice as premier because he is a disciplinarian who can crack down on the corruption and inefficiency among cadres involved in implementing economic reforms. Some diplomats say the choice of Do Muoi could slow down the reform momentum, sending a wrong signal to the average Vietnamese, who preferred <PERSON> Kiet </PERSON>, 66, a pioneer of economic reform. <PERSON> Kiet </PERSON> was first vice premier before becoming acting premier after <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON>'s death. The radio report did not say whether he would return to the old post. Do Muoi is the third-ranking member of the Politburo, the top policy-making body. He gave up the vice premiership last year after becoming the No. 2 man in the party secretariat, where he is said to have directed a purge of inept and corrupt elements in the 1.8-million-member party. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1939 and held key party and government posts during the struggle against the French colonialists, the Americans and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Central Committee May Get New Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New members of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> may be chosen at a national party conference next week, but most of the sessions will be closed to the public, a Soviet official indicated today. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference that the 5,000 delegates to next week's conference could have the right to elect new members to the 300-plus <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The new members could replace the 60 to 70 members who have died or have become so-called `` dead souls'' by losing the positions that gave them the right to spots on the committee. <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> refused to say definitely, however, whether new people would make it onto the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or other leading party organs. He was similarly vague about many details of procedure and agenda for the conference scheduled to open Tuesday. It will be the first since 1941. <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> confirmed a report in the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> that only the opening and closing sessions of the conference would be broadcast live on national television, with other coverage limited to summaries of conference speeches. That is likely to disappoint the many reformers who have published demands in the state-run media for full television coverage. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, editor of the reformist weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday about 70 delegates were likely to take the floor during the conference, which government spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> has said will run from June 28 to July 1. <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> refused to confirm that timetable, saying only the conference could decide how long it would sit. He also tried to suggest there was no fixed number of speakers, saying the presidium would give the floor to speakers in the order they ask for it. <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> said speakers would have the right to amend their remarks for the written record. `` It is up to the delegate himself to decide what his remarks will look like,'' <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> said. `` That's his right.'' <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> said `` the most prestigious workers of the various party organs'' will get together before the conference opens to decide who should sit on the agenda-setting presidium. The restricted coverage of the party conference is similar to the access at the previous party congress in 1986. As at that forum, party leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will give an opening report followed by selected speakers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech is supposed to outline his further plans to reform the economy and open up the party and society. There has been a growing feeling among <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intellectuals in recent days that the party conference will not be a reform-setting gathering, as was predicted several months ago, but rather a dress rehearsal for the next regular party congress in 1991. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had said in May he wanted conference delegates to be strong partisans of perestroika, his term for the restructing of Soviet society. But public protests in various Soviet cities over undemocratic delegate selection, and the failure of some prominent reformers to be elected delegates, indicate conservative party forces have put a brake on the conference as originally envisaged.

Researchers, led by <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> and political scientist <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Monfort </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, analyzed data from the 60 largest public school systems between 1967 and 1986. They concluded the schools have become increasingly segregated over that period because of a dramatic rise in Hispanic students and a steady erosion in white enrollment. `` Predictions about central city districts losing the majority of their white students came true,'' <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> said Wednesday, `` but now, not only are blacks still being segregated, Hispanics are being more segregated at an even-faster rate. `` However, the segregation is not the result of whites leaving public schools, so much as migration patterns and changes in the birth rates,'' he added. Among the report's most significant findings: _ Total enrollment declined by 15 percent in the 60 districts to 6.7 million over the 19-year period White enrollment declined by 16 percent, while the number of black students increased by 5 percent and Hispanic students by 103 percent. _ The 25 largest central city school districts now serve 28 percent of all black students, 30 percent of all Hispanics, but only 3 percent of white students `` What that means,'' he said, `` is that the school systems that are decisive to the future of large parts of our minority groups are almost irrelevant to the white population.'' _ Almost half of the largest public school districts are now in the suburbs and metropolitan counties alongside urban centers The researchers did not attempt to assess the consequences of segregation or to propose solutions. But <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> said: `` Schools that serve black and Hispanic populations exclusively serve a disproportionate number of poor kids. They continue to do much worse than white schools in academic achievement, graduation rates, and almost any other measure of providing a successful education. `` And the worst part,'' he added, `` is that almost nothing substantial is being done to change it.''

But <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> said: `` Schools that serve black and Hispanic populations exclusively serve a disproportionate number of poor kids. They continue to do much worse than white schools in academic achievement, graduation rates, and almost any other measure of providing a successful education. `` And the worst part,'' he added, `` is that almost nothing substantial is being done to change it.''

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Japan Will Play More Active International Role</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> says his country is determined to play a more active global leadership role equal with its economic superpower status. In his first visit to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland Wednesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also defended his country's burgeoning investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying they have created jobs. Acknowledging that some Americans view <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a threat, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said they have created more than 200,000 jobs and would help improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> one day after the close of the economic summit of the leaders of seven major industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The prime minister said he hoped his visit to `` the hub of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland'' would contribute `` to broader and deeper Japan-U.S. relations.'' Speaking at a dinner hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> quipped that he hoped a fireworks display scheduled afterward over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> would `` shake the sky above and help bring ... some rain'' to the drought-stricken region. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> echoed the same themes he sounded at the summit, at which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> offered a plan for Third World debt relief and signaled its willingness to accept the international leadership role that goes with its economic power. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who became prime minister in November, said, `` Playing an active role commensurate with our national strength responds both to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s interests and to the expectations of the peoples of the world.'' `` I have therefore set, as the highest goal of my administration, the building of a <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> contributing more to the world,'' he told about 1,000 dinner guests at the Fairmont Hotel, including Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> outlined what he called <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` International Cooperation Initiative,'' under which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would increase cultural exchanges, take part in peace-keeping actions and offer debt-relief to developing countries. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s official development assistance, announced at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit, would total $ 50 billion for fiscal years 1988-92, more than double the sum for the previous five years. By next year, he predicted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would surpass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the world's largest development assistance donor. The Japanese government has recently drawn up a new five-year economic plan that `` is in harmony with the world economy'' by boosting domestic demand and opening up the Japanese market to imports, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. He said the agreement announced this week to liberalize Japanese imports of beef and citrus fruit should lead to a further expansion of agricultural trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's biggest purchaser of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also said Americans had no reason to be pessimistic about their country's future. `` No country can replace the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in its central role as the leader of the West,'' said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, whose speech in Japanese was simultaneously translated into English through headphones. `` A strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is essential for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s future.''

 Fires that appeared set by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> arsonists lit up the night in rural areas and a widespread power outage darkened <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities and the occupied territories this morning, officials said. The blackout left major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities and the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> without power for three hours. Authorities were investigating the outage but had ruled out sabotage. In mostly Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> high school students today stoned two Israeli buses, slightly injuring several passengers and smashing one front windshield, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The radio said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> schoolgirls also stoned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> vehicles on the area's main shopping thoroughfare. The radio did not specify how many bus passengers were hurt and the police spokesman was not in his office. Also today, the army said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops arrested a knife-wielding Palestinian shepherd who allegedly tried to stab an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> in the same <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> area where an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> was bludgeoned to death Monday. An army helicopter chased the shepherd Wednesday after he tried to stab an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who told him to leave a restricted military zone near the communal farming settlement of <LOCATION> Shekef </LOCATION>, the army said. On Wednesday, a Palestinian was killed and two wounded in violence, bringing to 211 the number of Arab fatalities in the 6 -LCB- - month uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Four Israelis also have died. Leaders of the uprising issued one of their most militant directives Wednesday, urging Arabs to form paramilitary `` strike forces,'' to destroy <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> property and attack Palestinians who collaborate with the Israelis. The authors of leaflet No. 20 called for two general strikes, including one on Tuesday, the 21st anniversary of the annexation of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after its capture by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. At about 11:15 a.m. -LRB- 4:15 a.m. EDT -RRB- power suddenly went out in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know what happened, but we're checking it,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on an emergency telephone line during the outage. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Avri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that sabotage was ruled out. <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> said officials were still investigating the cause. Palestinian leaders had designated Wednesday `` Arson Day,'' directing Arabs to set fire to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> farmland, forests and factories to protest the 21-year-old Israeli occupation. Israeli officials, who mobilized thousands of firefighters and volunteers to meet the threat, said about 15 blazes were reported Wednesday but the figures were still being compiled. At least 10 were blamed on arson. Overnight fires broke out in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and nearby <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, a blaze gutted a knitwear factory on the top floor of a three-story building, said fire department spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. He said the blaze was under investigation but the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> quoted police as saying it was arson. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said another fire broke out at a factory that produces cooking oil in <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>. It said police were investigating the cause. Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> blamed some blazes on Israeli children. He said three 9-year-old Israelis were caught setting fires `` just for the fun of it ... Now the Arab children who do it, some of their motives are the same, and some are being sent, sometimes for money.'' So far this year, about 35,000 acres of forests and fields have been wiped out by fire, about 10 times last year's total. Police spokesman <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldapfel </PERSON> reported more than 330 cases of arson from January to June, including about 130 fires linked to the Arab uprising. The number of fires set by Palestinians has risen steadily, from about 40 percent of the blazes in January to 80 percent in June, he said. Destruction of trees is especially painful in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where much effort has been put into turning arid lands into woods and farms. Many of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s trees have been donated by American Jews.

 Burning phosphorus from a derailed tanker spread a toxic cloud across five <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> counties, driving thousands of residents from their homes before it began dissipating today. The phosphorus burst into flames in 99-degree heat late Wednesday when 34 cars of a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> train derailed and the chemical leaked from one car. The fire burned itself out shortly after dawn today. `` It's very, very much dissipating,'' state police Trooper <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitney </PERSON> said today. `` It's not as dense as it was. It's not as irritable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> this morning lifted a restriction imposed overnight on all air travel at or below 2,000 feet in the area. State officials temporarily closed some roads. The only remaining fire this morning was a minor brush fire nearby, officials said. Phosphorus fires can not be extinguished with water and must burn themselves out, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, spokesman for the state Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cart </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> superintendent of operations for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> division, said the railroad had been given permission to begin clearing cars on the south end of the derailment. He said the derailment's cause was not known. Most of the 2,500 people in six area communities in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> were evacuated Wednesday night, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. Between 40 and 50 people were treated in area hospitals for respiratory and other problems, according to medical officials. However, many residents began returning home by this morning even though the evacuation order had only been lifted in one of three counties. White phosphorus spontaneously burns when exposed to air temperatures above 85 or 90 degrees, said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Temperatures in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> hovered in the 99-degree range on Wednesday and were forecast to reach the upper 90s today, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The cloud, which contains an acid emitted in the phosphorus smoke, can burn human skin and, if inhaled, the nose and lungs, <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said. Emergency officials went door-to-door in the towns Wednesday night, warning residents of the chemical plume and, in some cases, advising them to leave. Temporary shelters were set up in schools and churches. Many evacuees suffered from respiratory problems and burning eyes and were treated with oxygen, said <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nortonville </LOCATION>, where about 500 people were sheltered. `` I could taste it. My tongue got real tingly,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeley </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, who was spending the night at the school.

<TEXT>
 A third <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company says it will begin human testing of a prototype AIDS vaccine designed to protect people not infected with the deadly virus. <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that tests on humans will start in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in the initial step in clinical studies that could last 10 years. The tests are being conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Biocine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subsidiary of a Swiss pharmaceuticals giant. The first clinical trial will involve 20 to 25 healthy Swiss men who do not carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome and AIDS-related complex. <ORGANIZATION> Biocine </ORGANIZATION> said it is now selecting the participants. It is the first human testing of a prospective AIDS vaccine in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and may expand to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within a year, said <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Two other companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Oncogen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MicroGeneSys </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> _ already have begun human trials on AIDS vaccines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> said it has already conducted tests on chimps, goats, rabbits and guinea pigs. But `` since animals do not get AIDS, animal studies provide limited information about the ability of a vaccine to generate a protective immunity against the AIDS virus,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Dina </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION>'s virology program. `` Much of what we nee to know about the vaccine's effectiveness must await the results of our initial human studies.'' Typically, it takes five to 10 years to test a prospective vaccine, he said.

 Police cordoned off <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s holiest <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> shrine at dawn today and surrounded student demonstrators who had set up a `` strike center'' on its grounds. The closing of gates leading to the Shwedagon Pagoda, a centuries-old hilltop shrine, comes after students angered by authorities' closing of their schools fought riot police in the capital's streets. A dawn-to-dusk curfew was imposed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> after Tuesday's clashes, in which state radio said nine people were killed and 77 arrested Following the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday morning, students from the campus went to the Shwedagon and opened a `` strike center.'' The pagoda's central tower is covered with several tons of gold. Some pilgrims returning from the pagoda Wednesday said about 500 students were on its grounds. The figure could not to be confirmed, and details of what occured in the pagoda after the gates were shut were not available. Classes at key schools in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second largest city, <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, were suspended today, and a curfew was imposed Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION> following mob violence, according to residents reached by telephone. Pegu is 55 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The Pegu residents said demonstrators destroyed some government buildings, cooperative shops and vehicles in a rampage that began in front of a high school. Residents said there was no unrest in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, 385 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and the suspension of classes at <ORGANIZATION> Mandalay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> seemed to be preventive measures. The current protests appear to stem from widespread disatisfaction with the one-party regime of military strongman <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who seized power in a 1962 coup. The government has restricted individual freedoms. And economic conditions in what was once one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s wealthiest nations have worsened in recent years. Most shops in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s sprawling markets closed at noon today for fear of looting in the event of renewed unrest and some government employees left work early. Students dressed in green sarongs _ the uniform of high school students _ tried unsuccessfully to persuade residents in some parts of the city to join them on a march to the heavily guarded pagoda. The march did not materialize. The government has also banned all processions, demonstrations and public meetings. The restrictions are to last until Aug. 19. Attendance at high schools and the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ the capital's only center of higher learning still open _ was minimal. Teachers have been instructed to continue classes regardless of the number of students attending. No major incidents have been reported in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> since the curfew was imposed on Tuesday. A few taxi drivers, tri-shaw pedallers and street vendors have been arrested for venturing into the streets before curfew ends at 6 a.m. but have reportedly been released after a warning. The disturbances in the capital erupted Tuesday when about 5,000 students and other protestors fought stone-throwing duels with police. Students at several institutions had peacefully demonstrated last week for the release of detained students and legalization of student unions. Violence erupted after the government responded by closing the schools. The country's first riots since 1974 erupted last October when the government declared invalid much of the currency in circulation and offered no compensation. On March 18, several days of student unrest climaxed in a rampage by students and others that was swiftly crushed by police and military units. A government panel announced only two deaths and said 625 people were arrested, many of them since freed. But diplomatic sources told reporters in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, that as many as 100 people died in the March violence.

 Two more escapees from the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> were captured after a brief exchange of gunfire with police in a cornfield in rural central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, officials said. The two convicted murderers were among eight inmates who escaped a week ago from the prison at <LOCATION> Eddyville </LOCATION>. Three were captured earlier, and officials in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> were awaiting records to determine whether a man in custody there was another escapee. State police Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said nobody was injured during the shootout Wednesday that ended with the capture of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, 27, both of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Both men were armed, he said. They were caught about two miles east of <LOCATION> Campbellsville </LOCATION> and only about 300 feet from a temporary command post that state police had set up in the parking lot of the <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The two were spotted crawling through the field by several children playing kickball behind the church. <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had dyed his hair red, and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> had cut his hair. `` No, I never thought we'd get caught,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> told television reporters after his capture. Late Tuesday night, state police had discovered tote bags containing bullets, new clothing, canned food, and hair dye believed dropped by the two fugitives. The eight prisoners escaped from the maximum-security prison by sawing open their cell doors. They cut through a prison window and climbed down an extension cord while guards were distracted by fires set elsewhere in the prison by other inmates. Officials in <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said they were checking the identity of a prisoner there to see if he might be one of the escapees. The prisoner fits a physical description of the escapee, but fingerprint records and photographs would not be available until sometime today, officials said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s major cities, the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> lost electrical power today for up to three hours, but a utility spokesman ruled out sabotage. At about 11:15 a.m. -LRB- 4:15 a.m. EDT -RRB- power went out in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, and as far south as the seaside resort of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> on the Egyptian border. Also affected were the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the causes, but company spokesman <PERSON> Avri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> about four hours after the outage that officials had ruled out sabotage. Power was restored to most locations after an hour, although <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and some parts of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> remained without electricity for another two hours. Southern District police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> initially told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that police were investigating whether the outage was a case of sabotage. But <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> later said officials had determined the outage was not caused deliberately, although they were still were unsure about what caused the electrical failure. Underground leaders of the 6 -LCB- - month-old Palestinian uprising, in a leaflet distributed Wednesday, called on Palestinians to `` continue destroying the property of our fascist enemy. The leaflet was one of the most militant directives issued, urging Arabs to form paramilitary `` strike forces,'' to destroy <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> property and attack Palestinians who collaborate with the Israelis. Israeli army officials said they were affected by the power outage but that the electrical cut did not hamper security operations in the occupied territories. Radio broadcasts appeared unaffected by the outage as stations apparently switched to emergency power generators. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, long lines formed at banks after computers went down and tellers had to conduct transactions manually. Outdoor cafes were packed as shoppers and store owners fled from hot shopping malls when air conditioning went out. Massive traffic jams were reported in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, where police directed drivers by hand at major intersections.

 Two years ago, high water levels sent waves crashing over miles of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> shoreline, chewing up beaches, submerging marinas and causing millions of dollars in destruction. Today, drought has helped lake water levels drop up to 3 feet since then _ good news for the suffering recreation industry and for home owners who feared their property was doomed. `` The drought is having a major effect on lake levels,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, head of lake hydrology at the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. If the trend continues, the lakes will drop below their monthly average levels for the first time in 10 to 15 years. Declining water levels have decreased the threat of erosion and landslides and improved conditions for sunbathers and recreational boaters, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, whose lab is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our docks are 4 or 5 feet above water level,'' said <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Demink </PERSON>, who works at South Haven Municipal Marina. `` When I first started coming here -LRB- two years ago -RRB-, if it rained the water would go over the docks.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, 71, said that in 1986, he and his wife feared their `` dream house,'' which sits 280 feet above <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, might slip into the lake. `` About 50 feet of our frontage was destroyed in two landslides,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. `` Now, we feel more confident that we'll be able to stay here longer.'' The Great Lakes have dropped 2 feet to 3 feet since their record-highs in 1986, when waves left lakefront homes teetering on scooped-out bluffs. On June 17, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was 31 inches lower than it was in October 1986, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. In the last month, lakes <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Huron </PERSON> dropped 2 inches, <PERSON> Erie </PERSON> dropped 3 inches, Superior stayed the same and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> went up an inch, he said. Lakes <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Erie </PERSON> peaked in the first half of April and have been steady or falling since, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. In an average year, the lakes do not peak until July or August, but hot, dry weather has caused much water to evaporate, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. Even if the drought ends, most of the moisture from much-needed rain would be absorbed by the parched soil and little would run into the Great Lakes. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has considered diverting some water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION>, which have been drying up in the drought. `` Changing the diversions would only change the lake levels by a matter of a couple of inches,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. A 1929 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a lawsuit, however, set limits on how much water could be diverted from the lake into the river system. The lawsuit was brought against <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> by other Great Lakes states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredenburg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the North Central Division of the corps of engineers. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> must be petitioned to change the limit. The latest came in 1980 when the court said 3,200 cubic feet per second could be diverted. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wente </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said although he is glad the water has dropped from levels that swamped his marina two years ago, the shrinking trend has drawbacks. `` We're a good 3 or 4 inches from where we were a month ago,'' he said. `` We've had to do a lot more dredging here in the harbor entrance, and it's costing us more.'' `` If it continues at this rate, it's going to be trouble in a couple of years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pravda Says Soldiers Deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pravda said today that soldiers have been deployed in several cities of the disputed region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the site of massive ethnic protests. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper warned that those responsible for the ethnic unrest in the southern republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> eventually would be held responsible for their actions. `` In the past days, the situation in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has become even more tense,'' Pravda said in a report from <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of the disputed region. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has belonged to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923, but Armenians consider it part of their ancestral homeland and are demanding that it be incorporated into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The majority of its 160,000 residents are Armenian. `` The migration of Armenian families to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and Azerbaijanis from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is continuing. In a number of cities, including those of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, soldiers have been brought in,'' Pravda said. A general strike and daily meetings and demonstrations are continuing in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, Pravda said. It did not say where the soldiers have been deployed, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents showed film Monday of soldiers protecting the Armenian section of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Reports said eight Armenians and eight Azerbaijanis were injured last week in fights in two Armenian villages, <LOCATION> Masis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sayat </PERSON> <PERSON> Nova </PERSON>. `` Those who put the long friendship of the two nations in danger, sooner or later must be held accountable,'' Pravda said. `` Only quiet, restraint, a clear understanding of the current situation can prevent extremely undesirable consequences,'' it said. Residents of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> have been agitating since February to have their territory annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The governments of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> have backed the demand, but <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has refused to go along. National officials have offered an economic and social development plan. Officials say 32 people, six Azerbaijanis and 26 Armenians, were killed in rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> at the end of February and beginning of March. Pravda said a general strike that began May 23 in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> has led to despair among some residents, but they can not back down. `` Many understand the senselessness and absurdity of their method of self-exhaustion, but there is nothing they can do. The affair has gone too far.'' On Wednesday, a resident of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> said some residents had been persuaded to return to work by their legislature's request to central authorities to approve the annexation request. The resident said about half of the estimated 30,000 strikers remained off their jobs. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Wednesday that the annexation request would be taken up by the Presidium of the national Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s highest legislative body, but that it probably would not be discussed in the near future

 A couple described as friendly and church-going and their 11-year-old daughter were slain by a shotgun-wielding assailant, and police arrested the couple's 14-year-old son in the killings, authorities said Detective Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Naile </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> sheriff's department declined to speculate on a motive for Wedneday night's slayings of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnell </PERSON> and their daughter, Their bodies were discovered by police on the kitchen floor of the Carnells' home about 3 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Davisburg </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Naile </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Carnell </PERSON>, whose age was unavailable, and her daughter were dead at the scene, he said. <PERSON> Carnell </PERSON>, 35, was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Osteopathic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The boy was at the house and offered no resistance, <PERSON> Naile </PERSON> said. He was being held in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> while authorities sought warrants charging him with three counts each of open murder and use of a firearm during commission of a felony. Divers recovered a shotgun believed to have been used in the slayings from a pond behind the home, the detective said. An unidentified neighbor told The <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> that the boy ran to her house about the time of the shootings. `` The boy pounded on my door and said he needed help,'' the woman said. `` He said, ` Someone shot my mom and dad and they are after me.' He was a very frightened young kid. I turned the outdoor light on. I said, ` Do n't worry, I'll call the police.''' The woman said police advised her not to let the boy inside. Police said the boy initially told them his family had been shot by two men, the newspaper said. Another neighbor, who was not identified, told the newspaper that the Carnells had lived in the small ranch house for five years after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnell </PERSON> bought it from his father. `` They go to church almost every night,'' the neighbor said. `` They are very nice people. They never hurt anybody. They were friendly. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> was very nice. Everytime they go somewhere, their children were with them. The children go to <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Attorneys for three men convicted of smuggling a bomb into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> say they wo n't appeal the prison terms of up to 16 years given to their clients. The government alleged the three men, who are natives of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and hold Canadian citizenship, are members of a Syrian political group responsible for several acts of terrorism. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffrin </PERSON> told the men Wednesday it did n't matter to him whether they belonged to an extremist political party; his concern was that the explosive device they had been carrying could have caused serious damage. `` The lethal potential, however, is clear,'' <PERSON> Coffrin </PERSON> said. `` Any victim of a bombing is an innocent victim.'' Defendant <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Younan </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON> each received a 16-year sentence in federal prison. <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mourad </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty one day before the others went to trial, was sentenced to eight years in prison. <PERSON> Younan </PERSON> had faced the stiffest penalty, up to 35 years in prison. <PERSON> Mourad </PERSON> had faced 10 years in prison, and <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON>, 30 years and six months. <PERSON> Younan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON> pleaded innocent but never testified at their trial. None of the three addressed <PERSON> Coffrin </PERSON> during the sentencing hearing. Instead, they chose to have their attorneys speak for them. `` He says, ` I'm not a terrorist,''' <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. `` He simply says, ` I know what I am.' ... He asked me not to beg on his behalf, not to grovel on his behalf.'' The defense attorneys claimed victory with the sentences, saying the government had proposed a plea bargain in which 20-year prison terms were offered in exchange for a guilty plea and cooperation with the government. The three were arrested last October and charged with smuggling a homemade bomb into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Richford </LOCATION>, a small town on the Vermont-Canadian border. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government claimed the three were members of a terrorist group responsible for the 1982 assassination of a Lebanese President-elect <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. Their attorneys described them as mere bunglers as opposed to professional terrorists. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Terwilliger </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the three men are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The group was founded in the fascist era of the 1930s and was devoted to the formation of `` Greater <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'' that encompassed several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nations. <PERSON> Younan </PERSON>'s cousin says <PERSON> Younan </PERSON> is a member of the party, but denied that it was a terrorist group. Attorneys for <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mourad </PERSON> denied their clients were members at all. <PERSON> Terwilliger </PERSON> said he felt the sentence was appropriate. `` It's one of a very few incidents involving a person associated with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> terrorist organization actually being in possession of explosives on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil,'' he said

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The new military regime today arrested the former prime minister's nephew in a growing roundup of members of the deposed government and their relatives, family friends said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has protested the arrests and says at least two of those reportedly being held have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. An independent radio station today said three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens also were being detained. Family friends told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that armed men in civilian clothes early today arrested <PERSON> Alix </PERSON> <PERSON> Celestin </PERSON>, nephew of former Prime Minister Martial <PERSON> Celestin </PERSON>. The friends said that the men in plainclothes stole jewelry they found in the house. Meanwhile, a newspaper reported the arrests of three telephone company officials, apparently because they had cut the lines to the homes of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and his top officers during last week's power struggle between the military and the civilian government. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> overthrew President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> on Sunday night and proclaimed himself president the next day. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> is in exile in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said he believes at least 20 of his supporters have been jailed. Some said Wednesday they were going into hiding. One, 75-year-old adviser <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigaud </PERSON>, was released Wednesday. His family said he was fatigued and would n't comment. A spokesman for the regime confirmed Wednesday there had been an unspecified number of detentions since the army took over Monday. No reason has been given for the roundup. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Savain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of the also-detained former Minister of Information <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Savain </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benodin </PERSON>, a top <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> adviser, are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Radio Haiti-Inter today said <PERSON> Benodin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mireille </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> party officials <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> also hold <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship and were detained. The private daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matin </ORGANIZATION> reported today the arrests of <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanty </PERSON>, director of the state telephone company <ORGANIZATION> TELECO </ORGANIZATION>, and of two members of his staff, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loiseau </PERSON> and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgart </PERSON>. The army, the paper said, arrested them for having ordered the lines cut to the homes of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and his top officers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday expressed concern. `` We find that alarming as one of the first acts of the <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> regime,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We have taken that issue up with <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> officials, making clear ... that we expect strict respect for internationally recognized human and civil rights.'' Also said to be among the arrested <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> aides was <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lescouflair </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who worked as a schoolteacher in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> could not say whether <PERSON> Lescouflair </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. He said there had been no direct contact between the embassy and the new government's leadership. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ran the country as head of an interim junta for two years after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile. He turned over power in February to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who was elected the previous month in military-run elections that were rife with fraud. Independently run balloting Nov. 29 was thwarted by attacks on voters in which more than 30 people were killed. Last Friday, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> under house arrest and dismissed him as military chief in a dispute over assignments of army officers. Soldiers freed the general Sunday night, captured the national palace and sent <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Acedius </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, information minister of the new military government, confirmed Wednesday over independent Radio Antilles that some prisoners still were being held. He did not say how many, but said they were being treated well.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman says a bicycle messenger wearing a T-shirt that proclaimed `` Meese is a Pig'' was not admitted to its headquarters because he was `` inappropriately attired.'' `` Just as we would not permit somebody to come strolling in here with a bathing suit, for example, I think it's reasonable to have some kind of standard,'' spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said the messenger, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalvey </PERSON>, `` was inappropriately attired.'' <PERSON> Stalvey </PERSON>, who said the incident occurred June 10, visited the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> this week to tell legal director <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> about the encounter. `` We are prepared to bring suit if they say this is their policy,'' <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> said. `` It seems like a perfectly clear case of discrimination based on the content of the T-shirt.'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said `` this is an interim policy until a firm determination can be made on how such matters ought to be handled.'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> `` obviously does n't understand what the First Amendment is all about,'' said <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>. `` If they had a rule that said no T-shirts, that might be an acceptable rule. But apparently they have a rule that says no T-shirts that insult <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. Presumably, this guy would have been allowed in if he was wearing a T-shirt that said ` Reagan-Bush'84'.''

 A black man riding his bicycle was assaulted early today by four white men who screamed racial slurs as they beat him with sticks and fists in the second such racial incident in two days. On Wednesday, a black man was chased by six white men shouting racial slurs and beaten with a baseball bat in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The bicyclist, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON>, 25, was treated for cuts and bruises at a hospital. One of his alleged assailants was later arrested. <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> was riding his bike at 2:30 a.m. in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> when he saw a white woman arguing with a white man, said police spokesman Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>. The white man left, and <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> approached the woman to offer his assistance, when four white men began shouting racial slurs at him and threw a bottle at him from across the street, the detective said. The gang chased him and began beating him with sticks and their fists. <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> sought refuge at a gas station where the attendant called police. The victim in Wednesday's incident said the attack reminded him of the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> racial assault that left a black dead. `` It's the same incident, racial,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said. `` I was minding my own business. I just get jumped for no reason.'' After the attack, <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> found refuge in a pizzeria owned by two white men who came to his defense and were themselves harassed and assaulted by the gang. `` I feel weird about that,'' said <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, adding that the attack had left him bitter toward whites. `` I get jumped by six white guys, then helped by two white guys.'' Three of the whites were arrested shortly after the attack and three others surrendered Wednesday night. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, 24, was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises to his right arm and released. `` <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> was the first thing I thought of,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON>, one of the pizzeria owners. `` It was n't right. This guy was doing nothing wrong.'' In that highly publicized case, a dozen white youths attacked a group of three blacks outside a pizzeria in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> in December 1986. One of the black men died when he was hit by a car while trying to escape. Three white teen-agers were convicted of manslaughter last December. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> was walking home from his job as a cook at a Burger King restaurant in the mostly white <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> neighborhood at 12:20 a.m. when he noticed a car carrying white men. The car slowed, and the whites began harassing him. `` They were calling me racial names _ nigger, <PERSON> blackie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said. The men left their car and began beating <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> on the right arm with sticks and a baseball bat and chasing him, he said. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> ran into the Cafe DiSicilia. `` He was nervous, his arm was messed up, he said he just got jumped by a carload of white guys,'' <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> said. The pizzeria owner gave <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> some ice and offered to drive him home. Then the six white men appeared in front of the parlor. <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> said he and a dishwasher went outside to try to disperse them. The gang initially challenged the two men, but then walked away. <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> said he, the dishwasher and the other owner, <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Taormina </PERSON>, drove <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> home. Later, the gang returned to the pizza parlor and taunted <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taormina </PERSON>, calling them `` nigger lovers,'' <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> said. `` One of them had a bat, and went to swing it at me, but <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> caught it,'' <PERSON> LaMartina </PERSON> recalled. `` We smacked them around a little bit, and they ran away.'' Neighbors who saw the confrontation called police, as did <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> when he got home. Six youths, ranging in age from 18 to 20, were arrested and charged with second-degree assault, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a deadly instrument. Three also were charged with criminal possession of marijuana, and one was charged with driving while intoxicated. All pleaded innocent.

 A vintage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transport plane left <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> today to mark the 40th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift, a massive mission to feed and clothe millions of Berliners sealed off from the rest of the world by Russian troops. The C-47 aircraft took off from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and landed at <LOCATION> Templehof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at 4:14 p.m. at -LRB- 10:14 a.m. EDT -RRB-. It's a short flight between the two cities, but for the 2 million Berliners blockaded by the Soviets at the end of World War II, the 250-mile jaunt meant the difference between life and death. During the airlift's 15 months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British cargo planes ferried more than 1.8 million tons of food, coal and other vital supplies to the Allied-controlled sectors of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, an enclave deep inside what was then Soviet-held territory and is now <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Among the passengers aboard the C-47 flying to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> today were the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and French ambassadors to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Earlier, the ambassadors attended the opening of an airlift exhibit in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and ceremonies at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rhine Main Air Base near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Most of the airlift flights originated at Rhine Main. Taking part were <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallaby </PERSON>, French Ambassador <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Boidevaix </PERSON>, West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airlift </LOCATION> began June 26, 1948 and ended Sept. 30, 1949. It was masterminded by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, the military governor of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> zone of conquered <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> following World War II. Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the three other victorious World War II Allies led to the Soviets move to cut <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> off from the West. Soviet dictator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was staunchly against creation of a unified German state in the three Western occupation zones, and when the Western allies backed a currency reform to speed up economic recovery of war-torn <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> imposed the blockade. Just four days after the money reform on June 20, the Soviets blocked all roads, waterways and railway lines leading to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ 110 miles deep in Soviet-occupied territory. In response, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> ordered all cargo planes available to deliver provisions to keep the hope for democracy in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> alive. The continuous string of small C-47, C-54 and other cargo planes ferried about 120 tons of supplies to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> daily at the start. By April 1949, the `` Raisin Bombers,'' so-called because the crews often brought along candy and raisins for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s hungry children, were bringing in about 13,000 tons of supplies a day. After the Soviets called off the blockade on May 12, 1949, the Western allies continued the flights to the end of September until normal land, waterway and rail traffic had resumed. More than 277,000 flights were conducted during the airlift, costing $ 200 million.

 A Soviet spy ring exposed by Canadian authorities tried to infiltrate a U.S.-owned military contractor that has access to highly classified American naval technology, news reports said. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported late Wednesday that the ring was after sophisticated warship electronics slated for a new generation of Canadian naval frigates. It said the sonar, radar and communications equipment is made by <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today quoted unidentified Canadian officials as saying <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION> had access to classified technology including equipment that controls weapons systems aboard <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which monitored the activities of the eight Soviet diplomats and officials expelled last week and nine others barred from re-entering <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, would not confirm the link with <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION>. But spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today: `` It was n't one single operation _ some of these operations have been over four or five years.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the company said no one was available to comment on the incident. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that Canadian authorities had prevented any severe security breach. The Soviet government expelled two Canadian diplomats in retaliation Wednesday and said three others currently out of the country would not be allowed back. Spokesman <PERSON> Viatcheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON> of the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> termed the expulsions from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> `` a provocation.'' `` These people were not doing anything wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and other government officials declined to provide details of the Soviets' activities, though <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said they included attempts to infiltrate national security intelligence agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> said one of the Soviets expelled was a naval attache at the Soviet embassy in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and was `` caught red-handed in a sting'' operation. It connected his expulsion to the arrest earlier this month of a Canadian of Hungarian descent, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON>, who was charged with attempting to obtain classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military documents from the <LOCATION> Argentia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval base in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. The base monitors Soviet submarine movements in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> also said parts for the new Canadian frigates were once shipped on a Soviet freighter, and Soviet agents took the opportunity to examine them. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> announced that a Soviet defector, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Smurov </PERSON>, had provided `` useful information'' in connection with the expulsions and has asked to stay in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with his family. The <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Smurov </PERSON>, a translator at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, was a Canadian double agent who `` identified most of the Soviet intelligence agents.'' In December 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION> was awarded the first part of a $ 950 million contract to build the combat systems for six new Canadian frigates. The company, which was established in 1983, had already been working on the weapons systems and electronics for six other Canadian frigates. At the time, Minister of National Defense <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> termed the order `` the first concrete example of the implementation'' of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ambitious plans to improve its military. The report that the Soviets were seeking information on the Canadian frigates appears significant because <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies have recently moved to standardize much of their frigate-building technology. <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copr </ORGANIZATION>. took over <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 4.8 billion deal. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is a leading defense contractor in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In June, Datamation magazine ranked it the third biggest computer company nationwide with revenues in that area of more than $ 8.5 billion.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he has privately decided whether he would accept the vice presidential nomination but has not shared that decision with likely Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Privately, yes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said when asked the question by a reporter after a meeting with his state campaign chairmen from around the country. However, he reiterated the campaign's public position that he has earned `` ` serious consideration'' to be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate. Before departing on a trip to thank his supporters in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he's certain that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at some point will announce the criteria he is using to pick a running mate. Asked to assess whether he's been given fair treatment by the Democrats in convention preparations, he said, `` I feel positive about it. I feel hopeful about it.'' He said the process is ongoing, adding, `` The process is one thing. The conclusion ... is another.'' The director of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention operation, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said Wednesday the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> forces want to see some changes in party rules, but do not anticipate trying to challenge any rules in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month because their concerns are being met through `` accommodations.'' Acknowledging some sticking points remain on foreign policy platform issues, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> nonetheless expressed optimism a consensus could be reached with apparent presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> steered away from any hint of convention turmoil, saying negotiations with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> representatives have shown `` a real willingness and desire'' to iron out differences in the two camps. He said the campaign wanted `` to make it known that we are going with a positive, constructive, unifying attitude, to make it known that we want the party and the ticket to be stronger when it leaves <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> than when it goes in.'' Speculation about how much of a fuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would make at the convention over rules and platform issues has followed the committee process leading to this weekend's drafting of the platform in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and the rules committee meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has several suggestions for rules changes he wants the convention itself to address. Asked if he would try to change any rules for purposes of this summer's convention, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> indicated that probably would not be the case as long as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> keeps working on shifting delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the states where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> considers the process unfair. The proposals, he said, `` are prospective in nature,'' adding: `` As far as 1988 we are seeking accommodations. And we feel positive about the way those discussions are going.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants to see rules changes that would tie the popular vote more closely to the candidates' delegate counts in states where it is not directly proportionate. He also wants to make the so-called `` super delegates,'' who are free to vote as they like, more representative of the popular vote in their states. Later today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was leaving for a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where he won a non-binding `` beauty contest'' primary. But voting for delegate slates there awarded all 57 to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> may be hoping to persuade some of the delegates to support him at the national convention, his local backers say he is mainly interested in underlining the role of Puerto Ricans in his `` Rainbow Coalition.'' Puerto Rico Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to campaign for him, angering some Puerto Rican politicians on the mainland as well as at home. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, who recently met with <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> political leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to patch up any differences, planned to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The island's 3.2 million people are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens but do not vote in general elections.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> judge today refused to rule out the death penalty as a possible sentence in the court-martial of a sailor accused of killing a disbursement officer in a robbery.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Figures Confirm Two Tons of Plutonium Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists campaigning against nuclear weapons say new calculations confirm that about 2.3 tons of plutonium produced in British civil nuclear reactors is missing. But authorities say the scientists have misunderstood the problem and gotten their figures wrong. In a letter published today in Nature, a science weekly, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and three British scientists say their 1985 claim of a shortfall is borne out by more detailed figures which the government began publishing last year. They say they do n't know where the missing plutonium has gone, but speculate that it went to nuclear weapons programs in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or both. The letter to Nature is signed by physicists <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of the pressure group Scientists Against Nuclear Arms; <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Unicam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Aptox, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The problem centers on a 6.8-ton gap between government civil stockpiles, and the amount the scientists calculate actually were produced. The scientists said they have calculated that four tons went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in exchange for enriched uranium under an agreement that lasted until 1971. About half a ton was lost in reprocessing, leaving 2.3 tons unaccounted for, they wrote. They said their 1985 calculations could not be confirmed because the government then was not disclosing figures. But when the government began publishing figures for each of its nine reactors, these coincided with the physicists' earlier calculations, proving their original model was correct, they wrote. Even so, the government figures are rounded out to the nearest 110 pounds of plutonium per reactor, which taken together would be enough to arm 100 warheads a year, <PERSON> Barnham </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Monk </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the government's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The scientists' figures are inaccurate, because large numbers are involved and because they would appear to lack basic understanding of the processes involved.''

 A nationwide survey of 1,400 hospital executives shows that 48 percent of them think reduced <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursements may force their hospitals to close in the next five years. Small, rural and government-owned hospitals in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are most vulnerable, according to the survey conducted and paid for by the Boston-based Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> accounting and management consulting firm. Suburban hospitals and hospitals owned by religious organizations also may be much more likely to close than in previous years, the survey showed. Hospitals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> showed the greatest increase in the likelihood of closure, according to the study titled `` U.S. Hospitals: The Future of Health Care.'' In 1986, hospital executives estimated that 21 percent of their facilities might close. In the recent survey, the chance for closure jumped to 46 percent of local hospitals. `` The fact that so many hospitals anticipated failure is even more dramatic when one realizes that 150 hospitals have already closed in the last two years,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, national director of health services for <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. If the survey predictions are accurate, 680 hospitals will close in the next five years, he said. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said the main reason for what the survey called American hospitals' `` increased vulnerability to failure'' is the decrease in revenues under the Medicare Prospective Payment system, a program created in 1983 to standardize the amounts <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimburses hospitals for in-patient care. Almost 70 percent of the hospital executives surveyed said hospital incomes have dropped since the program's inception. In contrast to small, rural and suburban hospitals, inner-city hospitals and other urban hospitals show no indication of a greater potential for closure since a 1986 survey, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said. Hospitals with the least chance of closure are located in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states and on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Other findings of the survey: _ Occupancy rates are at an all-time low Forty-six percent of the hospitals surveyed reported average occupancy of less than 50 percent. _ The quality of care was perceived as declining In 1986, 55 percent of hospitals ranked the health care available in their regions as excellent, but in 1988 that number dropped to 44 percent. _ There are signs of increasing limitations on health-care delivery Three-fourths of the hospital officials questioned believe health care given patients should be curtailed when the cost of providing that care becomes excessive. Questionnaires were sent to hospital executives at all 5,678 acute-care hospitals in the country.

<TEXT>
 Huge landslides roared through eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> today, crashing into houses, a school, a line of cars and a coffeehouse jammed with people stranded by an earlier slide, authorities said. Up to 100 people were believed buried. Rescue teams recovered three bodies under the wreckage, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> agency reported. The dispatch said at least 18 people were injured in the disaster in a mountainous area of <LOCATION> Macka </LOCATION> township, about 350 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and not far from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,'' the news agency quoted a witness, <PERSON> Zeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilhan </PERSON>, as saying. Landslides struck at least three houses, four stores, a restaurant and a high school, according to news agency reports. The school was in summer recess. But the coffeehouse was packed with at least 30 bus passengers who had been waiting there after the highway was closed by an earlier landslide just after midnight, the reports added. Deputy Gov. <PERSON> Erkan </PERSON> <PERSON> Isilgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> province told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that rescue teams feared the death toll would climb since so many people were missing. <PERSON> Isilgan </PERSON> said rescuers were trying to find out whether the passengers included any foreign tourists. Rain hampered rescue operations. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official supervising the rescue operation as saying it could take as long as two weeks to clear the debris if rainfall continued. Public Works Minister <PERSON> Safa </PERSON> <PERSON> Giray </PERSON>, who flew to the site, told <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> that rescue teams might recover some people alive. `` That is what we hope,'' he said. The state radio reported rescue teams were moving slowly to search for victims because of threats of more landslides. The dispatch said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were trying to drive away the mud and stone which covered the site. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said the landslides struck along a stretch of road where several cars were waiting in line since just after midnight, when an earlier landslide blocked the highway. The bus passengers had been waiting in the coffee house after the highway was closed, the reports added. Schools were in recess. Provincial Gov. <PERSON> Enver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hizlan </PERSON> was quoted as saying the army would be called in to help. The ministers of transportation, interior, public works and energy ministers, flew to <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>. Some landslides which have occurred in the area have been blamed on extensive deforestation.

<TEXT>
 A judge today granted a mistrial in a lawsuit pitting actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> against a delicatessen owner after jurors said they could not deliberate impartially after getting a look at unauthorized evidence. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoarski </PERSON> declared the mistrial after jurors sent a note out of the jury room that they could n't ignore depositions that were never entered into evidence but were inadvertently turned over to them before deliberations began two days ago. The judge's ruling reversed one he made earlier in the day when he instructed jurors to disregard copies of depositions from <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> deli owner <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> and others involved in the case. Gold had alleged during the three-week, breach-of-contract trial that an attorney for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> promised him 8 percent of the stock from <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s food company in return for helping <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Own </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The jury, which had deliberated for eight hours over two days, was sent home Wednesday after its foreman told the court that it had received depositions from Gold and some defendants and wanted to see <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s attorney, said Wednesday it appeared the clerk who took the exhibits into the jury room inadvertently also took the depositions. Author A.E. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s longtime friend who is also being sued, said, `` Alice in Wonderland falling down the rabbit hole had a more sane time of it than I did falling in this judicial hole.'' Gold filed suit against <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> resident; his two food companies, <ORGANIZATION> Newman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Own </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON>. Gold claimed that he helped develop and market <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own salad dressing and was promised the stock. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said he contributed 30 months effort to <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s company and believed that his work led to its success. The defendants have denied all of the allegations. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade and popcorn, has donated $ 15 million to charity since 1982. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said he once considered giving a gift of stock to four people who contributed to the food venture but <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> was not among them. He also said he decided not to give away any stock after his lawyer advised him against it.

<TEXT>
 A death row inmate who faced execution Saturday won a 30-day stay on the same day that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the state's death penalty law. Convicted killer <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> got the stay Wednesday from a federal judge in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> because new attorneys in his case asked for more time. Also Wednesday, the high court announced its long-anticipated decision that it had voted 6-3 to uphold the conviction and death sentence of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Attorneys for <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> had contended jurors were not allowed to consider any mitigating circumstances in sentencing <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> for the 1975 abduction-slaying of nurse <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. Since the high court agreed to hear the case late last year, only one inmate, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Streetman </PERSON>, was put to death. Dozens of prisoners used the pending case to obtain stays of execution. After hearing of the high court decision Wednesday, death row inmates were predictably glum. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 27, who had not yet heard of his stay was philosophical. `` If it's going to happen, it's going to happen,'' he said of the possibility of his death. Many inmates believed the Franklin case, the most serious challenge to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death penalty law in several years, would result in a ruling favorable to them and commutations of their sentences to life. `` I feel like an idiot having put my hopes in the court,'' inmate <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said. `` This is a bitter disappointment. It's not easy seeing your friends hauled off to be killed. `` I'm afraid they'll try to get as many as they can before the next issue comes up,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>, another death row resident. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> has turned down interviews since the ruling. His attorney, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, said he likely would seek a rehearing for <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> but that the high court rarely granted such motions. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he doubted the pace of executions would quicken and speculated the court would analyze capital cases on a case-by-case basis. `` It's pretty nice when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says you're right,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general who handles death row cases. `` The plurality opinion is very close to what we said in our brief.'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said it is likely <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> would be rescheduled for execution and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would vacate stays issued to other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> inmates who cited the <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> case. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which uses lethal injections, has executed 27 convicted killers, more than any other state since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976.

 <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Naumovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>, still energetic at 77, jumped up and pulled a bundle of papers from one of the shelves that line the study of his cottage in the forested writers' colony outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Carefully, lovingly, the novelist laid the bundle on the desk next to the window, untied the string and pulled out two covers of the largest Soviet literary magazine, Novy Mir, one from 1966 and the other from 1978. In the soft light, filtered through the trees, <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> held up first one and then the other of the blue sheets of stiff paper, tracing with his gnarled finger the underlined announcement that the journal would soon publish `` Children of the Arbat,'' his novel of the Great Terror waged by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the 1930s. Both times, in 1966 and 1978, publication was blocked by the men in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, men who rose to power under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>'s patience paid off. More than 21 years after it was written, `` Children of the Arbat'' was published last year in the literary journal <ORGANIZATION> Druzhba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narodov </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Friendship of Peoples -RRB-, as part of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to reform the tyrannical system created by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> The novel has since appeared in hardback editions, and was published in English in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month by Little, <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The book probes more deeply than any other yet published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s mind and methods, the pettiness and arbitrariness that guided his followers, the innocence of his victims and the terror he created. It tells the story of <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankratov </PERSON>, a young man of 23 who, like <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>, was sentenced without trial for a crime he never committed and sent to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> for three years of cold and lonely exile. <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> grew up in the apartment building inhabited by most of the book's characters, No. 51 Arbat Street, an old shopping street in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that was at once popular among the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> elite and among fashionable young people. <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> is working on the sequel, `` 1935 and Other Years,'' which will continue the story, and like `` Children of the Arbat,'' will give intimate portraits of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his lieutenants and describe how he terrorized his deputies and the country. `` The entire nation lived in fear,'' said <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>, his craggy features grim beneath a balding pate and gray hair. `` Only one person thought for himself. Everyone else abandoned free thought.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his supporters have concluded that a nation based on such a system can not survive in the technological age. During the years <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> waited for his blockbuster to appear in print, he lived and worked at his peaceful dacha, or cottage, at <LOCATION> Peredelkino </LOCATION>, the wooded village where the Nobel Prize-winning poet and novelist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> wrote and is buried. <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> earned a comfortable living by writing 11 other novels, as well as screenplays for television and movies. He resisted the temptation to publish his works abroad, as <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> and others had done. <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> was ostracized, his works banned until recently, and <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was exiled to the West. `` I wanted to publish it in this country,'' said <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>. `` I wanted to change my country. That is why I have been so patient.'' Hardback and paperbound editions of the book are expected to reach 3.5 million copies, he said, a phenomenal circulation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where a run of 100,000 is considered generous for works of fiction. The book disappears from stores before it reaches the shelves. The only places it can be found in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are in hotel shops open only to foreigners and at a special store on <PERSON> Kropotkin </PERSON> Street that accepts no rubles, only Western currency. On the black market, it sells for 30 rubles -LRB- $ 51.40 -RRB-, more than 10 times its retail price. Inside the <PERSON> Kropotkin </PERSON> store, a saleswoman told an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitor, `` I'm sorry. We do n't have ` Children of the Arbat.' It has n't come in yet.'' Then she lowered her voice. `` I'll get you a copy. But just one.'' She disappeared, returning a few minutes later with the volume. The written word has played a huge role in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> since the 19th century, when works by writers such as <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> were a moral and spiritual counterbalance to the authoritarian rule of the Czars. The influence of writers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is immensely greater than that of any American author in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think that fiction is as important in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in shaping the image of a country in the minds of the people,'' said <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>, just back from a month-long trip to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, his third visit in as many years. In reforming the Soviet system, said <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>, `` the first step is to change the psychology of the people. Perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- started in literature, films, the mass media, the fields that shape people's spiritual lives and thinking.'' `` We need to reshape people's minds, and that will inevitably lead us to economic freedom,'' said <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>. `` Children of the Arbat'' deals largely with the purges within the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and only mentions in passing a far bloodier episode _ the 1929-32 collectivization of agriculture _ which caused a famine and, according to estimates by Western scholars, claimed 8 million lives. <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> said he will explore this in greater depth in his next novel. `` My figures are even higher,'' he said. Although food shortages persist, six decades later Soviet authors have only tentatively touched on the collectivization issue. Any detailed discussion might lead to calls to return the land to private farmers, a step reformers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have taken. <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> lets a grin crease his leathery face: `` I am no expert on decollectivization, but we need greater freedom in the village.'' The smile gives way again to a look of grim determination. `` Who will take land and cultivate it if he fears that someone will take it away from him?''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today his administration had been entirely open about a prison controversy under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has decided whether he wants to be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate but would not divulge his decision unless offered the job. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a day care facility at a private business as the prison probe erupted. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, noting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' status as the certain Democratic presidential nominee, took the unusual step of saying the governor himself was `` not the subject of an investigation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it is looking into a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration multi-million dollar proposal to purchase land for a prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a plan vigorously opposed by the community. `` The process was as open as it could possibly be ... We have very tough procedures for the acquisition of property,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, was besieged with questions about the vice presidential nomination. Had he decided in his own mind whether he would accept if offered? `` Privately, yes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. But then he cut off reporters. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a series of private meetings scheduled today: breakfast with former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, an afternoon session with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, and evening meetings with Australian prime minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> has been mentioned as a longshot vice presidential prospect on a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticket. Some observers believe a woman on the ticket might boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support among female voters. A number of polls have suggested that women are far more likely to back <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his likely opponent. But the vice president dismissed such surveys. `` What you do is spell out your positions on the issues and the gender gap goes away and you win the election,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told local reporters Wednesday on a trip to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that the process of picking a running mate had `` just begun. However, campaign sources indicated the pace was picking up, as several vice presidential prospects _ including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> _ were invited to submit background and financial information to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign for scrutiny. One lawmaker, however, said he wants to be crossed off the list of contenders. New Jersey Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said through a spokesman that he had told the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign he was n't interested `` He's absolutely unambiguous about this,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatiello </PERSON>. Pressed about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied that the second-place finisher in the primary races was under `` very serious consideration.'' However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` it helps'' for a vice presidential contender to have held public office. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> never has. The two met Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, after weeks of signals from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he should be offered a spot on the ticket. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the two talked about the selection of a running mate, but refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the head of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention team, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not directly ask for a place on the ticket. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has enough delegates for a first-ballot victory at next month's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, betrayed a flash of impatience when asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s refusal to concede the nomination. `` It's over,'' the nominee-to-be said shortly. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday won the backing of <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race last September amid allegations of plagiarism and exaggerating his academic record. One of the most damaging stories to surface at that time was <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s liberal borrowing, without credit, from a speech by British politician <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> bowed out, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' top aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> admitted that he distributed the `` attack video'' featuring the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> speeches that triggered the stories. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign had initially denied any role in the incident. And when <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> what he had done, the candidate wavered before finally accepting his aide's resignation. However, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said later he blamed only himself. The <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> senator's expression of support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, nine months after the collapse of his candidacy, came in a telephone call from <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s home, his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> is recuperating from surgery last month to repair an aneurysm near his brain. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> welcomed the endorsement, praising <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> as a `` leader and a fighter'' who can be a `` tremendous help'' to the campaign. Two of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's other former rivals for the Democratic nomination _ Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> _ were to be on hand for a pricey <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tonight. In other developments: _ <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said reports that his city will not be ready in time for the Democratic National Convention are exaggerated `` Anybody who does n't like <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> can go somewhere else,'' said the mayor. _ Dissident Republicans in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> have taken the first step toward challenging the credentials of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 77 delegates to the GOP National Convention After a dispute over party rules, the dissidents had walked out of the state GOP convention and held their own gathering. Now, they have sent the national party their competing list of delegates to the convention.

<HEAD>Unmanned Engines Run Through Three Towns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORANGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three unmanned locomotives today sped through three towns at speeds up to 40 mph before stopping on their own, officials said. The runaway engines traveled about 10 miles between the towns of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> in north central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. There were no injuries reported as a result of the runaway engines, said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Guilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the trains. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said a crew working on engines near the Gardner rail yard discovered the string of locomotives was gone at about 5 a.m. and they notified a dispatcher, who alerted local authorities. He said he believes the trains were released by vandals, and he said it was at least the second runaway since another string of locomotives sped out of control through nine towns last November until they were deliberately slammed into empty freight cars in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>. There were no injuries in that incident, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it has found no evidence of sabotage. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, however, said the two runaways and a third last January form a pattern that can not be coincidental. `` The circumstances are just too close,'' <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully somebody will begin realizing this is a serious problem and that we need help.'' The latest incident came four days after striking rail workers began returning to work, ending a six-month walkout over safety issues. Union leader <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloof </PERSON> said today that the workers could not have been involved in the alleged vandalism because they were busy taking physical exams.

 Three more indictments have been handed up in an investigation into the theft of civil service tests for metropolitan area police officers. Nine officers or former officers already have been convicted in the scandal that began in 1986 when a <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> police captain pleaded guilty to being the mastermind of the theft and distribution operation. The latest indictments include the first woman promoted to police lieutenant in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. Officials say the careers of more than 100 officers may have been stalled as they continue investigation of the scam. The three officers surrendered Wednesday and were released on unsecured bonds. Indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, were former Newton Lt. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, Revere Patrolman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON> pleaded innocent when arraigned in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> will be arraigned Monday. They face varying charges in connection with purchase or possession of advance copies of the tests. They face maximum penalties on each charge of five years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines. Former Metropolitan Police Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> pleaded guilty in 1986 to racketeering in connection with the theft and distribution of civil service entrance and promotional exams. He is serving a sentence of 30 to 40 years in state prison for a <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> bank robbery and faces an additional 15 years in prison in the civil service examinations case.

<HEAD>Private Study Concludes Back-Seat Lap Belts Are Risky</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rear-seat lap belts expose victims of car crashes to greater risk of paralysis or death than lap-and-shoulder restraints, according to a study released Thursday by product-liability lawyers. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, organization founded this year by attorneys involved in product-injury litigation, presented the study at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> government activities and transportation subcommittee. `` In crash after crash, children and adults are dying, being rendered paraplegic or quadriplegic or suffering disabling injuries to their abdominal organs while wearing only rear-seat lap belts,'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, president of the institute, testified. The tests commissioned by the institute were conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The tests used instrumented dummies belted into the rear-seat assembly of a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LX </ORGANIZATION> and subjected to simulated crashes. A 33 mph simulated crash using dummies the size of 6-year-old children showed pressure against the outer part of the lap belt when used alone was 61 percent greater than with a lap-shoulder combination. In a simulated crash at 27 mph using adult-size dummies, pressure on the outside part of the lap belt when used alone was 338 percent higher than with a lap-shoulder combination. A similar test at 32 mph showed a 145 percent difference. The results indicate `` a greater likelihood for lap-belt only occupants to sustain severe ... or fatal injuries in such crashes,'' the study said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sursi </PERSON>, program manager at Automotive Safety Testing, said in an interview the study did not address the question of the position of the lap belt on the passenger. Auto manufacturers and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have said a properly adjusted lap belt will provide protection because the force of the crash will be absorbed by the large pelvic bones. A misadjusted belt will result in the belt's cutting through the soft abdomen to the spinal column, studies have shown. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is to encourage manufacturers voluntarily to install lap-and-shoulder belt combinations in the rear seat while asserting that a lap belt alone provides better crash protection than no belt. A 1986 study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, however, concluded that lap belts used alone may cause serious injury rather than providing protection. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the nation's automakers, told the committee `` by 1990 virtually every car produced in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will be equipped with lap-shoulder belts in outboard rear seating positions.'' Automakers offer kits for nearly all models made in the last 10 years that allow owners to install lap-should belt combinations in the back seat of vehicles, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION>, however, said knowledge and availability of such kits is limited. The institute, on May 25-26, conducted a random telephone poll of 30 dealers for five automakers in six cities and found none had lap-should belt kits in stock, 21 said no kits were available and only eight said kits could be ordered.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today urged Austrians to remember its World War II past as he began a controversial trip that includes meetings with President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and a visit to a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, under bitter attack from Jews and shunned by most Western leaders for his alleged complicity in Nazi war crimes, led the official government welcoming delegation for the Roman Catholic leader. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, in his own greetings, denounced `` intolerance, intransigence and hate among nations, religions and classes,'' but made no direct comments about the dispute over his past as a German army officer. The white-robed pontiff's special <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 aircraft touched down at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Schwechat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> during a light shower. In comments delievered in German, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> mentioned his second trip as pope to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> will include the site of the former <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> death camp. He said such places recall `` times of hardship which have left their indelible mark. `` Let us, when we meet, bring before God not only the great and burdensome legacy of the past but also the joys and sorrows of the present,'' the pontiff said. Many Austrians claim they were victims of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> rule, and the nation's events marking the 50th anniversary of the 1938 annexation with the Third Reich have sparked a renewed round of soul-searching. The Polish-born pontiff drew the ire of Jews when he received <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> a year ago at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, an audience the pope later defended as `` necessary'' because <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> came as a democratically elected president. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> says the pope's meetings with world leaders do not imply his support for an individual or political system. `` This is not a political visit. It is a pastoral visit. He -LRB- the pope -RRB- was invited by the bishops,'' said <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. Today, six American Jews demonstrated outside <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s office to show their displeasure with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s decision to meet with him. `` Do not embrace <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, no!'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION>, N.Y. Standing with him were five Jewish students dressed in black-and-white striped uniforms reminiscent of those worn by concentration camp inmates during the Nazi era. Earlier this week, two representatives of major Jewish organizations met with a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> envoy in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to register their protests over the meetings. Dr. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beker </PERSON> of the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was `` going out of his way to legitimize <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>.'' But Rabbi <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanenbaum </PERSON>, director of international relations of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, warned against `` extremist hysteria and stridency'' over the meetings. In a statement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday, he pointed out that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was visiting a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> country and that it was <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> policy for popes to meet with heads of states of countries with which the Holy See has diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Tanenbaum </PERSON> also said his group had been informed by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s contacts with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` will be kept to an absolute minimum.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied that he committed war crimes, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has barred him, saying it found evidence he was involved in deportations of <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> civilians in World War II. An international commission of historians appointed by the Austrian government to investigate the allegations concluded in February that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was aware of Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> and did nothing to prevent them. It left open the question of whether he was guilty of wartime atrocities. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is to deliver about 20 speeches during the trip, his second to a country where the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> counts 6.4 million Roman Catholics, or 85 percent of the 7.5 million population. He paid a three-day visit in 1983. On Friday, the 68-year-old pontiff is scheduled to meet with representatives of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s 12,000 Jews, then visit the site of the <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> concentration camp where 110,000 prisoners died during World War II. On pilgrimages to his homeland, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Majdanek </LOCATION> death camps.

 The famed leaning tower tilted another fraction of an inch in the past year, a rate that might cause the landmark to topple in about 100 years, an expert said Thursday. <PERSON> Gero </PERSON> <PERSON> Geri </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pisa </ORGANIZATION> said that since June 1987 the tower has leaned 0.05 inches, according to measurments taken Wednesday. <PERSON> Geri </PERSON> is a member of the team which makes semi-annual checks of the displacement of several of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>'s architectural treasures, settling into the city's soft clay foundation. Although December's check-up showed encouraging signs that the tower's tilt may be slowing, <PERSON> Geri </PERSON> said Wednesday's readings indicated the monument had resumed its average tilting pace of about 0.04 inches per year. The 180-foot tower, completed between 1360 and 1370, is now leaning 14.6 feet off the vertical. `` We really do not know why it's still standing,'' <PERSON> Geri </PERSON> said. `` But judging from its current rate of shift and from the centuries the process has taken, we estimate that the structure will fall in a century if nothing is done to stop it.'' He added: `` No one is really sure when it will go down.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> has been trying for years to come up with a plan to save the tower, but any project is far from implementation.

<HEAD>Pentagon Investigation May Be Catnip for Both Democrats and
Republicans</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The burgeoning Pentagon bribery investigation may be developing into the kind of scandal both Democrats and Republicans can love. Little more than a week after it emerged into public view, the contract-fraud affair shows potential to become the most politically popular scandal in years, says one defense lawyer for a man targeted by the investigators. `` This is the best thing that's happened to both the Republicans and Democrats in six months, because for the Republicans it gets everybody's mind off -LRB- Attorney General -RRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and for the Democrats it gets everybody's mind off -LRB- House Speaker -RRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' said this lawyer, who has no desire for any more publicity for his or his client's name. `` So what you have is a natural tendency on the part of both parties to try to pump it up. You've got a Republican, -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, who's pumping it up, and you've got the Democrats too'' including Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the lawyer added. All four have joined the public outcry over the affair. `` It's the one thing everybody can join in on because it gets reporters off their leadership,'' the lawyer said. `` It's terrific, a perfect opportunity.'' This experienced attorney is one of a dozen <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers already hired by the contractors, consultants and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials named in government search warrants or grand jury subpoenas. He was giving his admittedly self-interested view of how government investigators had received such voluminous and favorable publicity for their side of the case through leaks, speeches and news conferences even before the investigators have brought any charges or made any arrests. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who 365 days out of most years solemnly refuses to discuss ongoing investigations in public, even held a news conference to outline the scope of the investigation and rebut <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>'s complaints that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had moved too slowly. Since the government's coordinated searches on June 14, the Pentagon story has muscled two high-profile investigations off the nation's front pages: the special prosecutor's imminent report on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> used his office to benefit himself and friends, and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics investigation of Democratic Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s finances and official actions The well-known names <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> have been replaced by those of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats, private consultants and contractors who are hardly household words _ <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and others. Even the congressmen whose names have been pulled in by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or investigative leakers as potentially of interest to investigators are not the best known on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ Democrats <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; and Republican <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Aides to those five point out that even the leakers do n't say they're under investigation at this time. Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> publicly says no one on the Hill is now a target. This is as close as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scandal comes to catnip for politicians. As <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> GOP chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strake </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, `` Every morning when I wake up, I run out to get the paper and see what the scandal of the day is, whether it's on them or us.'' The defense lawyer also offered some cautionary words for those tempted to translate leaks and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> search warrant affidavits into automatic convictions. `` It's a specific federal crime if you trade inside information on Wall Street, but there is a sensitive information flow between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and its contractors that is not only legal but even encouraged. Only in certain circumstances is that illegal,'' he said. The leakers have crowed over how unguarded their targets were as government agents secretly monitored their telephone calls and office conversations. But this lawyer, who has heard similar government tapes before, said, `` They may not have tapes that are that clear and what they are hearing may be legal or illegal depending on the intent involved.'' `` The tapes may have showed a need to check further,'' the lawyer said. But he emphasized that further investigation is just beginning with last week's massive seizure of records and the efforts to persuade targets to confess and cooperate. Even if the leakers are correct, he said, `` this would be dozens of separate, small conspiracies that take time to investigate _ not one, big conspiracy.'' All the search warrants were done together so that one search did not alert other people who might be involved in separate, similar schemes to begin shredding their documents. Based on his experience, this lawyer said, `` The people hemorrhaging information now are the ones who know the least. The ones who know the most do n't talk at this stage.''

<HEAD>Exhibits Changed At Stalin Museum, Georgian Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Recent criticism of the crimes of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> have prompted unspecified changes at the museum honoring him in his Georgian birthplace, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader of the southern republic said Thursday. The <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> museum in his native town of <LOCATION> Gori </LOCATION> _ which also has the last town square statue of the dictator left standing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ contained a large and uncritical display of artifacts tracing <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s life and political career. Georgian party head <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> was asked at a news conference Thursday whether the museum showed the Georgian party had a different attitude to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> than <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who in November condemned the dictator's `` enormous and unforgiveable crimes.'' `` There can be no other interpretations,'' said <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON>. He added that although <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> `` is not a Georgian problem at all,'' but a Soviet one, the museum at <LOCATION> Gori </LOCATION> had been reviewed since November and `` the exhibits there have been changed in the spirit of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s report.'' He did not detail the changes. There have been unconfirmed reports the museum would close prior to being turned into a museum of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s `` cult of personality,'' which is fiercely criticized in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media. Almost all monuments extolling <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> were dismantled after <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> condemned the former leader in 1956. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, however, some residents still proudly display pictures of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> at home or in car windows. In the capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, a river embankment, park and mountain railway are named for <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Even after <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s condemnation, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> continued to be extolled as a hero of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s World War II victory over <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, quotes from <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> are engraved on World War II memorials. This week, however, articles coinciding with the anniversary of the June 22, 1941, invasion by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> have openly criticized <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for failing to heed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warnings of a coming German invasion, suggesting he left the nation unprepared for attack.

<TEXT>
 Expanding federal crop insurance and diverting <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to allow resumption of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge traffic are among the steps needed to deal with the drought, speakers today told Midwestern governors. `` We'll need a little bit of time to determine what the losses are,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. `` But we will do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage.'' The 10 governors at the meeting told <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> about a number of problems. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said his state's soybean and corn crops would be lost without substantial rain in the next 30 days, while Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> said 70 percent of his state's grain crop already is lost. `` Welcome to the heart of the drought land,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said in opening the conference. `` We used to be known as the heart of the heartland. Now we are both.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said barge traffic _ much of it bringing crops to market _ is virtually closed on the vital commercial waterway of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, and he called for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to petition the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and allow diversion of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> water in order to get the traffic flowing again. <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> said the one-day conference would address how to prevent farmers struggling because of the drought from going broke and leaving the land and devising a long-term solution to dropping water tables throughout the northern tier and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the federal government's response would include expansion of existing crop insurance and disaster loan programs. He also cited the creation of task forces in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and within President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration preparing to respond to problems of the drought. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> left the conference after his speech, but said he would meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday morning to update him on the drought situation. Attending the day-long meeting, besides Sinner and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, were the governors of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced a toll-free number for farmers affected by the drought and seeking federal help. The number is 1-800-541-3375.

<HEAD>Americans Set New Record for Philanthropy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite scandals in the pulpits and problems on Wall Street, Americans reached deeper than ever into their pockets last year to give more than $ 93 billion to philanthropic organizations, according to a study. The $ 93.68 billion tallied in the annual report `` Giving USA'' was almost 6.5 percent more than the $ 88 billion given in 1986. The increase was nearly twice the rate of inflation, which rose by 3.7 percent, and topped the growth of personal income, which was just under 6 percent in 1987. Eighty-two percent of all charitable donations came from individual Americans. They contributed $ 76.82 billion, 6.65 percent more than they gave in 1986. Only one major category of donor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, failed to give more than in 1986; they gave $ 4.5 billion in 1987, the same as in 1986. Contributions by foundations rose by 8.14 percent to $ 6.38 billion and bequests from estates went up 7 percent to $ 5.98 billion. The figures were issued Wednesday by <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, editor of the annual report of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund-Raising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philanthropy </ORGANIZATION>. The October stock market crash, loss of deduction for non-itemizing income-tax payers and the scandals of fund-raising TV evangelists all presaged a decline in giving, but `` in the face of this, it increased significantly,'' said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. The biggest gift of the year was <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s donation of art worth $ 750 million to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Among the list of million-dollar-or-more donors were <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, who gave $ 5 million to his children's camp in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>; <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, who gave <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> $ 1.5 million, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who gave $ 1.3 million to <ORGANIZATION> Fisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Among the reasons corporate donations flattened out was what the report called `` the inevitable running out of steam'' after nearly a decade of enormous increases. The report also said serious economic difficulties befell key corporations, `` notably oil companies and the ` rust belt' manufacturers of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Northeast. The woes of TV evangelists notwithstanding, religion came in for its usual 40 percent to 50 percent share of donations. The estimate for 1987 was $ 43.6 billion, almost 47 percent of all charity contributions. The rest broke down as $ 13.65 billion to health groups and hospitals, $ 10.84 billion to education, $ 9.84 billion to human services, $ 6.41 billion to the arts and humanities, $ 2.44 billion to social activist causes and $ 6.89 billion to others.

 Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> says she is recovering from the concussion she suffered a month ago and still intends to run for governor in 1990. `` I've made the bend and am starting to feel better again,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said during a two-hour appearance Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, her first public outing of more than three minutes since her injury in a fall. At one point, she raised her arms and emphatically told the luncheon audience, `` If I did n't quit when I became acting governor, I'm not gon na quit now.'' She took office upon the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s conviction April 4 of impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. She joked about her fall off a dais in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, saying, `` Today is exactly one month that the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> were trying to sign me up.'' In the incident, <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>' Coach <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> accidentally grabbed onto her as he fell backward, knocking her from her chair and causing her to hit her head. The 66-year-old governor said her doctor has told her to limit her activity, but she added, `` I'm doing pretty good and I'm making a good comeback. That was quite a fall.''

<HEAD>Moscow Synagogue to Acquire Building It Lost During War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City officials agreed Thursday to return a building now used as a medical institute to the synagogue that owned it before World War II, two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet rabbis announced. `` We asked for this five years ago, 15 and 20 years ago, but no one would listen,'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayevich </PERSON>, said in an interview. The return of the two-story building to the Choral Synagogue on <LOCATION> Arkhipova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> fits a pattern of liberalization that began during preparations for the celebration of the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> During the celebration earlier this month, the government returned a monastery it had controlled in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and several churches throughout the country to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Soviet government has taken over church property since the 1920s. After the structure was built more than 100 years ago, the synagogue used it for Jewish community activities, but the government took it away in 1941 and made it into a hospital for World War II casualties, <PERSON> Shayevich </PERSON> said. It now houses a training center for doctors. It is adjacent to the beige synagogue, and the two doors connecting it to the synagogue are sealed. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rabbi, said he began campaigning 1 -LCB- years ago for the return of the building but made progress with Soviet officials just in the past two weeks, during the millennium of Christianity. `` It's part of a process that seeks to align religious believers with restructuring and rebuilding of society,'' <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> said in an interview in a synagogue office. `` They are trying to reach out to the masses.'' He said the return of the building `` would have been unthinkable'' during his first visit in 1966 and `` improbable five years ago.'' <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s deputy mayor, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arzhanov </PERSON>, agreed on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Thursday to turn over the building to the synagogue. The oral agreement is to be followed up with a formal contract later. <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> said the Jewish congregation he represents at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Synagogue </LOCATION> will help pay for restoration of the building and will send architects and construction specialists to offer advice. He predicted the building could be used within two years for adult Jewish education classes and a museum. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> synagogue also has agreed to help the medical institute find other quarters, <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> said.

 The House of Representatives telephone system went dead Thursday for the fourth time in two weeks, silencing half of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and leading one lawmaker to complain that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> would be `` depressed and despondent.'' The widespread outage brought howls from congressmen cut off from their constituents and district offices, and prompted a scramble by top officials of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which installed the $ 16 million system, to find out what went wrong. `` I do n't know what motivated this installation of the new system, but it's certainly proven to be a failure,'' Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, complained. Had Bell, the inventor of the telephone, been around during the last two weeks, he `` would have been most depressed and despondent, to say nothing of being embarrassed,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., said the communications glitch reminded him of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T television commercials showing distraught employees bemoaning their choice of a phone system and discussing how their businesses had been ruined The commercials end by proclaiming <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T `` the right choice.'' `` Well, in the interest of ... truth in advertising, I think we ought to admit that the same source of that advertising is the one that has the telephone system here in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> said in a floor speech. When the system went down for the first time last week, he said, `` it was kind of nice to have the break. No calls coming in, quiet in the offices. Everybody went off and got a <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> or did something.'' But as the outages kept recurring, he said, `` tempers increased.'' Members and staff described variously everything from totally dead telephones to intermittent operation of some lines. Calls could not be transferred. At times, all the lights on a telephone would go on at once and all the phones in an office would ring simultaneously. Officials in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clerk's office, which administers the phone system, said they were working feverishly to find out what had gone wrong and that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T had sent its top technical experts from all over the country to help diagnose the problem. `` It's a flukey sort of thing,'' said Deputy House Clerk <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Colley </PERSON>. The switching system which is the heart of the telephone network is a computerized AT & amp; T System 85, which is in wide use and has not been a problem elsewhere, he said. <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> system, which has some 17,000 telephones, is one of the largest in the country. `` We're losing a lot of calls, obviously,'' he said. `` Believe me, we have total attention from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T.'' Technicians suspected a software problem but were examining everything, including the possibility of computer hackers tampering with the system from outside, he said. An <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman, <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON>, said the company had pulled together its best technical minds and was working `` around the clock'' to resolve the problem. `` We do not know the cause. We have tried to replicate the calling situation of the House in our Bell Lab facilities in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to see if we can spot a software or hardware problem, but we have not been able to replicate it,'' he said. <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said the company was `` totally empathetic'' with lawmakers' frustration. `` We are frustrated. We have a commitment to get the ... problem fixed as quickly as possible,'' he said. The system was installed last August, and after some initial startup problems worked fine until it went dead for the first time last week, <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said. Since then, outages of an hour or more occurred on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. House Clerk <PERSON> Donnald </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> defended the system. `` We've got the best system on the market,'' he said. `` I still have confidence in System 85.'' Meantime, <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> had a suggestion for members frustrated by being unable to communicate with constituents: use the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and its television system as an `` electronic billboard'' to send open messages back home. `` And if nothing else works, my staff has come up with a prototype system,'' he said, holding up a pair of styrofoam coffee cups linked by a piece of wire. `` If I get the contract for $ 10 million or so to install this in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, I promise that it will work just as well as the phone system we have here now.''

 Here are some facts and figures about <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LAND _ <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is about the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and shares frontiers with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Resources include fertile soil, timber, oil and other minerals. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, with a population of 3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, in the heart of the country, is the second largest and the center of traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans. Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism and education is widespread.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $ 200 a year, putting <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> among the poorest nations. It once was the world's leading rice exporter but experienced spot food shortages in 1987 Its economic failure is generally attributed to poor government management and a crippling war against several ethnic minorities seeking autonomy. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are major aid donors and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a modest assistance program, mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s golden age was the 12th century, when its kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ruled it from 1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy, a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He has imposed isolationism, military control and socialist economics. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> seeks to keep out most foreign influence, including joint ventures with foreign companies, and has been nicknamed `` <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s hermit. Tourists are allowed to stay only one week.

<HEAD>Three Dead, About 100 People Reported Buried Under Landslide</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, ``The dispatch ... '' to UPDATE with 31

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Huge landslides roared through eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> today, crashing into houses, a school, a line of cars and a coffeehouse jammed with people stranded by an earlier slide, authorities said. Up to 100 people were believed buried. Rescue teams recovered three bodies under the wreckage, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> agency reported. The state radio reported that 31 people were injured in the disaster in <LOCATION> Catak </LOCATION> village in a mountainous area of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> province, about 350 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and not far from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,'' the news agency quoted a witness, <PERSON> Zeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilhan </PERSON>, as saying. Landslides struck at least three houses, four stores, a restaurant and a high school, according to news agency reports. The school was in summer recess. But the coffeehouse was packed with at least 30 bus passengers who had been waiting there after the highway was closed by an earlier landslide just after midnight, the reports added. Deputy Gov. <PERSON> Erkan </PERSON> <PERSON> Isilgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> province told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that rescue teams feared the death toll would climb since so many people were missing. <PERSON> Isilgan </PERSON> said rescuers were trying to find out whether the passengers included any foreign tourists. Rain hampered rescue operations. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official supervising the rescue operation as saying it could take as long as two weeks to clear the debris if rainfall continued. Public Works Minister <PERSON> Safa </PERSON> <PERSON> Giray </PERSON>, who flew to the site, told <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> that rescue teams might recover some people alive. `` That is what we hope,'' he said. The radio reported rescue teams were moving slowly to search for victims because of threats of more landslides. The dispatch said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were trying to drive away the mud and stone which covered the site. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said the landslides struck along a stretch of road where several cars were waiting in line since just after midnight, when an earlier landslide blocked the highway. The bus passengers had been waiting in the coffee house after the highway was closed, the reports added. Schools were in recess. Provincial Gov. <PERSON> Enver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hizlan </PERSON> was quoted as saying the army would be called in to help. The ministers of transportation, interior, public works and energy ministers, flew to <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>. Some landslides which have occurred in the area have been blamed on extensive deforestation.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomed on Thursday what it hoped was a `` flexible approach'' by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> toward negotiations to end a 13-year-old war between Cuban-backed government forces and U.S.-supported guerrillas. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, noting reports that the Angolan government is willing to enter peace discussions without demanding cessation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the rebels, said `` we welcome a flexible approach to these very complex problems we're addressing.'' His comments were made on the eve of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION>, South African and Angolan talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on a possible settlement of the conflict that has enflamed southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for more than a decade. One of the stumbling blocks in recent years has been <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s unwillingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Cuban forces in the country as long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backed the guerrilla forces of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> receives more than $ 15 million a year in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. In Thursday editions, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted Angolan Justice Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> would not be an issue in the talks about to begin. `` It is not appropriate for us to raise the issue now,'' the minister said. `` We will raise it with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> separately, at another juncture. The issue is not on the table for the current negotiations. We should not mix these subjects.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position has always been that that is not a subject for discussion and it has never been on the table in these negotiations.'' The American spokesman also said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would meet next week with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with the Angolan government delegation on Wednesday, the department issued a statement declaring `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes that the quickest way to end the conflict that has already consumed the lives of thousands of Angolans, is for Angolans themselves to meet and resolve their differences peacefully and without the pressures and interference of outside forces.''

<HEAD>Second Day of News Strike Keeps Papers Off Stands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nationwide journalists' strike, in its second day on Thursday, kept nearly all of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s national newspapers off the newstands and reduced state-run broadcasts to bare-bone accounts. The contract dispute also stilled news agencies, including the two major national ones, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION>. Among the missing papers were the leading sports dailies, but for soccer fans, it was probably just as well. The strike meant no post-mortems of Wednesday's night match between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which saw the Soviets kill the Italians' title hopes for the European championship. The state broadcasting network RAI had carried the match live to show the journalists' `` sensibility'' to the nation's soccer fever. The broadcast, which involves the services of journalists, was the only exception on Wednesday to the no-work day. On Thursday, however, <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> radio and television carried reduced newscsts, without video or audio services. Instead, an announcer designated by the journalists' union read the news in reduced form, including a declaration of why the strike was called. The strike was scheduled to end Friday, allowing the publication of Saturday's newspapers. Local papers and some that are outside the union, such as the leftist Manifesto, did publish. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> called the strike, which began Wednesday morning, over a breakdown in negotiations. Publishers and union officials have agreed on a $ 381 monthly pay increase in the new contract. But the unions are want a clause preventing newspaper chains from using a central newsroom to provide national and international news for the group, and publishers say that would be too costly.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rival Palestinian guerrilla factions battled with mortars and machine guns Thursday for control of two refugee camps in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said two people were killed and nine wounded. In a related development, the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group issued a threat to assassinate <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s chief spokesman for issuing a statement saying the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was ready to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The camp fighting raised the overall toll to 53 people killed and 215 wounded since the latest round of the war between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainline <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> broke out 14 days ago By police count, 102 people have been killed and 468 wounded in the camps of <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh since the two factions began their bloody feud May 1. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s guerrillas, dislodged from the two shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting, shelled the camps from Syrian-controlled territory in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early in the day. He said shells slammed into the two camps at the rate of one every 10 minutes at certain times. The shantytowns have suffered from repeated attacks from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem militias since 1982. The spokesman said sniper fire `` kept most roads in the two camps closed throughout the day.'' He could not be dentified in line with standing regulations. The fighting continued despite repeated efforts by neutral guerrilla groups and Libyan mediators to arrange a cease-fire between <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s group. The cease-fire broke down in part because of a statement issued by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> chief spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was willing to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. On Thursday, the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> faction issued a veiled threat to kill him. `` <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> is acting like the interred traitor <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartawi </PERSON>,'' said a statement from <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> published by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist as-Safir daily. <PERSON> Sartawi </PERSON>, a roving ambassador for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, was assassinated in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> blamed <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group, which opposes any negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sartawi </PERSON> was among the most moderate <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. He had met with Israeli moderates before he was killed. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> `` expresses the willingness of the group represented by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> ... to negotiate with the Zionist entity,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, earlier this month that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was willing to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and accept a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as a solution to the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>'s unusually conciliatory proposals drew strong condemnation from five Syrian-backed guerrilla groups. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, broke with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1974. He is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for a chain of terrorist attacks, including the December 1985 <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> airport attacks in which 16 people were killed. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the Al-Qabas daily reported Thursday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration will deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it publicly endorses <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>'s statement. The newspaper quoted `` reliably informed Western diplomatic sources'' as saying in a report from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that this had been conveyed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> through an unidentified third party. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said this week that the statement by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> was a positive step, but stressed it lacked the authoritative support of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership. Al-Qabas quoted diplomatic sources as saying the Americans considered <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>'s statement as `` the first <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statement which talks in detail about the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' desire to live in peace with the Israelis and the existence of an agreement between the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the Israelis to live in peace and security.''

Harmony and winning in November were the sounds from the campaigns of nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and remaining rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wishes to insure, by starting in unity with this committee today, that the tone will be set for a united convention leading to a united <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November,'' said <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> governor speaking for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made us all proud. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is looking forward to a very unified and winning convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' replied <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, speaking for his governor. `` He is especially thankful to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign for the determination to make 1988 the year of the Democrats.'' The campaigns had cut deals in recent days to resolve each of the remaining battles about delegates who will meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 18-21. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complaints about delegates in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> _ which were not filed as challenges _ are being worked out privately. But <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> warned that fights were to come this weekend when the convention <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets to talk about 1992 and beyond. `` There is still some disagreement with party rules, state and national,'' he said. `` Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has determined the proper place to take those disagreements is the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and seek changes prospectively.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a top <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, said the candidate wants changes that will bring the delegate totals in 1992 closer to the primary vote. He wants those changes written into the rules by the 1988 convention. The credentials meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ the only one scheduled _ was a quiet affair as the group slowly ratified every deal that was cut to settle the total of 21 delegate challenges. The group also put its stamp of approval on the delegates from all the states which had not been questioned. And a lack of credentials fights in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suits <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> just fine. `` We never get a second chance in life to make a first impression,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` When we think about what we are doing today, I think it is the first time in recent political history _ as far back as the secretary's office can advise us _ we've never started out the general election process at the Democratic convention free of credentials challenges. `` I think it's a credit to the presidential campaigns ... to settle these differences without rancor, in a sense of unity so we can begin this process with an eye on November.'' `` The chair will be absolutely delighted if on the evening news, nothing appears on television about us,'' added committee chairman <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Irvis </PERSON> gaveled the resolutions through methodically, joking at one point as he called for a vote: `` Those who approve say aye. Those who disapprove nay _ we wo n't hear them anyway.'' The last four battles to be resolved were <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate squabble in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and a spat between the national party and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. In the first two states, a few extra delegates were added _ without increasing the number of votes _ to settle fights. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, two delegates were added with full votes to enable both current <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and former <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> _ and one supporter each _ to go to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> in the Democratic mayoral primary last year. Originally, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and his supporter, <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, were elected delegates, but <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> challenged that in court, arguing that he and his supporter, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON>, should be seated. Now all four will go and the votes of four other <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> delegates backing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be cut in half to make room. This settlement, worked out Thursday morning, was slightly different from what officials said the deal was on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picks up six more delegates with a half vote each. Five delegates for Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and one for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ challenged by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ will go to the convention, but with half votes. Thus, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will gain three votes in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will lose 2.5 votes and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> half a vote. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, four <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters who were tossed off the delegate list by other <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers dropped their challenge, credentials officials said. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the state party ignored a national rule setting a threshold of 15 percent support before a candidate or group could win delegates to the national convention. The state convention last month gave three delegates to an uncommitted slate, even though it had only 13 percent support at the meeting. To settle the argument, the three uncommitted delegates have been accepted as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates by the campaign, even if they do n't vote for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s new premier said Thursday that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> wants to end its 9-year-old military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> so it can improve relations with other countries. `` The renovation in relations between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and foreign countries is very important,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> radio quoted Do Muoi as saying. According to the broadcast, Do Muoi `` said that to widen cooperation, first of all, it is necessary to maintain peace and security. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is striving to solve the <LOCATION> Kampuchean </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- issue.'' He said if possible, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will withdraw all its estimated 120,000 soldiers before 1990, its self-imposed deadline for a total pullout. Other Vietnamese officials previously have said an early withdrawal is possible if a political settlement is reached. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is to begin this month what it says is a pullout of 50,000 troops, the largest annual pullout. Do Muoi, a 71-year-old veteran organizer in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its third-ranking official, was named Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to replace <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON>, who died in March. Many non-communist Western and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries have embargoed economic aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since it invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. Hanoi-based diplomats say that in the past two years, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s new pragmatic leadership _ which gives priority to economic development _ has made a series of diplomatic initiatives on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> Before that, Vietnamese diplomats said the situation was `` irreversible.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> earlier this week that he will attend unprecedented peace talks involving Cambodian guerrilla factions next month in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Do <PERSON> Muoi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has established good ties with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, and there were prospects for such ties with the <ORGANIZATION> pro-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> groups <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The premier said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is `` seeking all means'' to hold peace talks with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Relations between the two countries have been tense since they fought a bloody border war in early 1979. On Wednesday, Do Muoi pledged to continue Western-style economic reforms. A Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> report seen here Thursday said he told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> he will `` thoroughly grasp the renovative spirit'' of reform resolutions adopted at a December 1986 party congress. The party has blamed years of orthodox Marxist policies for an economy that is one of the world's poorest. The reforms involve decentralization of management, material incentives and limited free enterprise.

<HEAD>Construction of Part of Shopping Center Near Manassas Battlefield
Halted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANASSAS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction of part of a shopping center adjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park will be halted indefinitely to prevent damage to federally protected wetlands, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. `` It's a dream come true,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, president of the Save the <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting the proposed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> complex. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has accomplished, at least temporarily, what developers and the county refused to do. We all feel relieved,'' she said. The cease-and-desist order issued Wednesday applies to work being done at <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, a creek running through the Civil War battlefield site, and on adjacent wetlands. Developers Hazel @ <ORGANIZATION> Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> have started construction of one of two roads that would cross the creek. The stop-work order, which extends indefinitely, was issued because the developers violated a corps provision requiring that the Army be notified when a project could affect a historic property, said corps spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Our concern is with the two roads crossing the creek,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` That work could have an impact on the park.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> T. -LRB- Til -RRB- <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>, president of the development group, has 10 days from receipt of the letter to explain why the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was n't notified about the road, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said The stop-work order could entirely block construction of the project or force the developer to alter its design if an investigation determines that the park would be adversely affected, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added. Preservationists claim construction of the massive project, which includes a 1.2-million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of office space and 560 homes, would destroy 50 acres of wetlands and ruin beaver dams and rare plants spread throughout the 542-acre tract. Historians feel the project will destroy forever the sanctity of the still-rustic setting of two crucial Civil War battles. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> @ </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that his firm would do everything in its power to comply with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s requests. The work-stoppage order came as proposals to block the project were gaining momentum in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, a House Interior and Insular Affairs panel held a hearing on several congressional proposals to take control of the development tract and add it to the 4,600-acre park. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., on Wednesday offered legislation that would deprive <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> @ <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of direct access to the site from Interstate 66 The measure failed in the appropriations subcommittee, but <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he would introduce it before the full Appropriations Committee.

<HEAD>States Must Plan Now To Cope With Minority Work Force, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An overwhelming majority of people entering the work force over the next decade will be women, minorities and immigrants, and they are likely to be stuck in low-level, low-paying jobs, a private study said Thursday. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based think tank, said steps must be taken now to assure these new workers have adequate education and job choices. The study drew its data from demographic analyses of several `` indicator'' states considered representative of the nation's population: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> It concluded that 20 million people will start work between now and the year 2000, and that 83 percent of them will be women, minorities and immigrants. Unless better education opportunities are provided, the jobs available to these new workers will continue to be low-level, low-paying service positions, the study said. For example, for every computer programmer hired in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there will be 13 new jobs for cashiers, the study said. States in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> will feel a decided impact on their student populations and work force from the increasing numbers of Hispanics, while the Southeastern states will face pressures from the growing number of blacks, the study said. States like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will have to make sure they have resources to provide for a fast-growing elderly population. `` There are significant challenges ahead which will require all sectors of society to join together if our states are to provide quality education and meaningful employment,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgkinson </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the institute. The institute includes representatives from education, business and the media. It is supported by various private foundations and also receives some federal money.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Debate Counting Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would require the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to figure out whether people are in the country legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in reapportioning seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a fairness issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the House Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member another must lose one. Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of illegal aliens at 2 million. The result, he said, was that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> lost <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., however, said he is unsure whether the bills backed by <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> and others are constitutional The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution requires the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to cound all the `` persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes of reapportionment. It does n't specify citizens. `` I am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are not ` persons,''' <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> said. Noting that at times in the past blacks and <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have been excluded from participation in government, he commented: `` I do not want to return to a time when some human beings are considered less than equal in the eyes of the law.'' `` Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` It was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes. And Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamente </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, termed the worry over counting aliens `` hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> into western and southern states has had a much larger effect on representation than the presence of aliens. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> also opposes the bills, contending that the effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the truth anyway. But Reps. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petri </PERSON>, R-Wis. and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodling </PERSON>, R-Pa., asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to states where the aliens And Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, contended that counting aliens `` in effect, is granting representation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to individuals who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Car Deal Turns Sour, Dozens Detained in Restaurant Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two gangs that disagreed about payment in a car deal drove into downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and battled it out with wooden clubs and metal rods in a popular restaurant, newspapers reported Thursday. Police investigator <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekmazov </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>'s Banner that 36 people, including witnesses and victims, were detained after the clash at the <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> Restaurant on Wednesday night. He said two gangs disagreed about terms of a car buying-and-selling deal they made Monday in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>, a site on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> notorious for illegal trading in cars. The gangs spent two days `` mobilizing their forces'' before coming to blows at the restaurant, <PERSON> Chekmazov </PERSON> said. The newspaper said in a separate dispatch by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency that the gangs arrived at the restaurant in their own cars. Neither Chekmazov nor <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave details of the car deal that turned sour. Those arrested, who were mostly from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s outskirts, ranged in age from 22 to 30 and included six people with criminal records. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s Banner published a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch saying the gangs were armed with wooden clubs and metal rods. It did not give a figure for the number of injured. Soviet newspapers have covered crime more extensively since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched his `` glasnost'' policy of openness on selected social, historical and other issues three years ago.

<TEXT>
 Huge landslides roared through eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> today, crashing into houses, a school, a line of cars and a coffeehouse jammed with people stranded by an earlier slide, authorities said. Up to 100 people were believed buried. Rescue teams recovered at least three bodies in the rubble, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> agency reported. The dispatch said at least 18 people were injured in the disaster in a mountainous area of <LOCATION> Macka </LOCATION> township, about 350 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and not far from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,'' the news agency quoted a witness, <PERSON> Zeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilhan </PERSON>, as saying. Landslides struck at least three houses, four stores, a restaurant and a high school, according to news agency reports. The school was in summer recess. But the coffeehouse was packed with at least 30 bus passengers who had been waiting there after the highway was closed by an earlier landslide just after midnight, the reports added. Deputy Gov. <PERSON> Erkan </PERSON> <PERSON> Isilgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> province told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that rescue teams feared the death toll would climb since so many people were missing. <PERSON> Isilgan </PERSON> said rescuers were trying to find out whether the passengers included any foreign tourists. Rain hampered rescue operations. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official supervising the rescue operation as saying it could take as long as two weeks to clear the debris if rainfall continued. Public Works Minister <PERSON> Safa </PERSON> <PERSON> Giray </PERSON>, who flew to the site, told <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> that rescue teams might recover some people alive. `` That is what we hope,'' he said. The state radio reported rescue teams were moving slowly to search for victims because of threats of more landslides. The dispatch said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were trying to drive away the mud and stone which covered the site. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said the landslides struck along a stretch of road where several cars were waiting in line since just after midnight, when an earlier landslide blocked the highway. The bus passengers had been waiting in the coffee house after the highway was closed, the reports added. Schools were in recess. Provincial Gov. <PERSON> Enver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hizlan </PERSON> was quoted as saying the army would be called in to help. The ministers of transportation, interior, public works and energy ministers, flew to <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>. Some landslides which have occurred in the area have been blamed on extensive deforestation.

<HEAD>Admiral Gets Confidential Recommendations in Mirecki Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investigative officer has made confidential recommendations on whether an officer and five instructors should be court-martialed for the death of a recruit at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. Cmdr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. D'Alesio, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> legal services officer stationed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, made the recommendations, based on hearings earlier this month, to Rear Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chief of naval air training, said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is expected to make a decision before he leaves his present job July 1 to take command of an aircraft carrier battle group in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. But depending on what he decides, the disclosure of his action may be delayed until after that date, <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> may decide to call for a court-martial, non-judicial punishment or dismissal of the charges. The five instructors were charged with involuntary manslughter and conspiracy to commit battery by forcing Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, into a swimming pool at the <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and holding his head under water until he collapsed. The alleged actions occurred when the sailor panicked on March 2 and said he was quitting the rescue course. Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, officer in charge of the school, is charged with the lesser offense of dereliction of duty. He has been relieved of his command. During the hearings, a pathologist testified <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died of `` sheer terror.'' The recruit's phobia of being dragged under water triggered heart failure that was followed by drowning, the pathologist said. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> panicked during an exercise known as `` sharks and daisies'' in which instructors grabbed students in head-holds to simulate a panicking air crash survivor. The exercise now has students practice rescue exercises on each other rather than instructors. The school was closed March 29 and reopened Monday with instructors barred from touching trainees. Students also are required to immediately be pulled from training if they say they want to quit or show fear, panic or excessive fatigue.

<HEAD>Three Israeli Children Hurt in Bus Stoning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Israeli children on their way back from a school hike were hurt by flying glass when their bus was stoned in an Arab neighborhood of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said Thursday. In a further sign of resurgent unrest that has struck <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> recently, outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> flags were flown from utility poles in several parts of the city. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> decided to free 89 Palestinian detainees and prisoners. An army official said the decision followed appeals from <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> notables and was made `` to contribute to the restoration of normal life.'' The army said it would pardon 17 prisoners, stop proceedings against 27 detainees, and cut short six-month prison terms of 45 administrative detainees. The Palestinians would be released Friday, it said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, speaking at a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, urged the police to suppress all manifestations of unrest in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` These threats must become a challenge to the Israeli police, who should make a special effort to repel every attack and cut off every hand that would be raised against the unity of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, our eternal capital,'' he said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the incidents appeared linked to orders issued by underground Palestinian leaders in a leaflet distributed Wednesday. The leaflet calls on Arabs to focus their disturbances on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to protest Israeli control of the disputed city. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed the Arab sector of the city after driving out <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> troops in 1967, but most countries have refused to recognize <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capital. Palestinian girls from a high school in the Shuafat quarter of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> stoned two Israeli buses heading toward <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON>, an isolated Jewish neighborhood surrounded by Palestinian communities, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The 11-year-old Israeli children were returning from a visit to Ammunition Hill, the site of a key battle in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Three students were hurt and treated at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said, adding that the injuries were believed to be minor. Police detained several Palestinians, including <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students, he said. In a separate incident, a Palestinian stoned an Israeli bus on <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> el-Din Street, the main shopping thoroughfare in the Arab part of the city, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The stone smashed a window but caused no injuries, he said. The latest unrest, following a four-month lull in violence in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, began Saturday when <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters blocked city streets with stones and attacked a police van and a lookout post atop the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Gate. Also Thursday, the Israeli army accused the London-based human rights group, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, of using biased sources of information and denied an <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> report that soldiers had killed Arabs by using tear gas improperly in its fight against the Arab uprising. The report accused <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers of firing tear gas into confined areas in violation of manufacturers' order, thus killing at least seven Palestinians. But a military communique said soldiers had instructions not to fire into rooms and said the tear gas used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` is not dangerous to human life.'' An electric power failure paralyzed most of the country and the occupied territories, stopping factory production, causing traffic snarls and disrupting telephone and other communications. The electric corporation spokesman ruled out sabotage as a cause of the outage. The power failure caused blackouts of up to three hours in most parts of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. It reached as far south as the resort town of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> on the Egyptian border. Police spokesman <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> initially said police were investigating whether the outage was the work of Palestinian saboteurs. However, <PERSON> Avri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, later told the AP the failure was caused by a torn high tension wire. `` No person could have cut it,'' <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> said. `` If anyone tried, there would be nothing left of him.'' Israeli officials and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> landowners said mischievous <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> children and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers seeking retaliation set some of the blazes that have scorched thousands of acres of land since May. Most of the 35,000 acres of greenery torched since this spring were destroyed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> arsonists. Underground Arab leaders called an `` Arson Day'' on Wednesday, and nine of the 14 fires which broke out apparently were set by Palestinians, police said.

 <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s former colleague in private life _ brought in to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to get control of procurement _ says he quit in frustration last fall because <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed to support his management reforms. `` I differ 100 percent with the -LRB- former -RRB- secretary of defense who said the system is fine but we have a few bad apples,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, the former undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition who was brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to carry out reforms recommended by another Californian, industrialist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, the former president of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, was `` 100 percent wrong'' in defending the way the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> buys weapons. In a telephone interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement process a `` national crisis,'' as serious for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as drug trafficking and the AIDS epidemic. `` We have institutionalized a bad system,'' said the 66-year-old <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election in 1980. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> was a division of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the huge construction company based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Between assignments in Republican administrations, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> served as vice president and general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was president of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> from 1975-1982. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> has said he thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons-buying procedures are generally adequate, but it is impossible to eliminate dishonesty on the part of some people. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said on Tuesday that although he does not condone misconduct, some corruption is `` understandable'' in an enterprise as big as the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, which spends $ 160 billion a year on acquisitions and which, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> noted Wednesday, lets more than 50,000 contracts a day. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said he accepted the job as the first undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition in 1986 with the understanding that he would stay only as long as he felt he was effective. The post was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of a report by <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential commission recommending changes in procurement practices. Packard served as deputy secretary of defense in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. `` I determined the job was not do-able in large part because of the unwillingness to make some hard decisions,'' <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said. Specificially, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to give him the support he needed to create a central management system for acquisitions, giving one person control over <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> buying and stripping service chiefs of some of their authority to decide which weapons system should be bought. The service chiefs would no longer control the acquisitions system, though they would carry out instructions, he said. His goal, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said, was to run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing system like a corporation since the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is `` the biggest business in the world,'' involving in some way over 100 million people and spending more money than the gross national product of some countries. Asked why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> did not back him in the way he felt he needed to create a central management system, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know. They just did n't support it.'' The showdown, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said, came when <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> complained <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> was `` getting into micromanaging'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> simply ignored the central management plan and was not brought to heel by his superiors, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said. `` If you are ignored, I consider that as tantamount to non-support,'' he said. <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment, his spokesman said. Without a central acquisitions system, no one person knows what the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is spending on weapons and how costs are being controlled, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said. Moreover, no one is accountable, he said. Instead, the service chiefs _ or `` warlords'' as <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> called them _ go their own way, establish fiefdoms, lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for money and let contracts for weapons. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, who serves on several boards of directors and operates vineyards in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he was unaware of the federal investigation into allegations that bribes and gratuities were paid for crucial information about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts and secret information was passed from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to defense contractors. Authorities are looking into allegations that defense contractors obtained classified information through their consultants in order to get billions of dollars of defense contracts. While <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said he did not come in contact with specific incidents of wrongdoing, he said the entire system needs to be overhauled. `` We have to make major changes in functions, authorities and accountability,'' he said. One idea, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said, is to have three people running the Pentagon: one to oversee the military's combat-readiness; one to deal with policy matters; and a third to operate the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> business Asked if his policy disputes with <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> have soured their relationship, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> replied: `` We are not as we were.''

<HEAD>Strong GNP Growth Prompts Administration to Boost Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a strong 3.6 percent rate in the first three months of 1988, prompting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday to make what was once considered a too-rosy forecast even rosier. After the October stock market collapse, many private economists expected a slowdown or even a recession this year. They criticized as unrealistic White House projections saying the economy, as measured by the gross national product, would grow at a steady 2.9 percent pace, the same as in 1986 and 1987. But booming growth in the last three months of 1987 and continued strength this year sent analysts scrambling to revise their forecasts upward until the administration estimate began looking pessimistic. On Thursday, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, boosted the administration's GNP forecast for all of 1988 to 3.5 percent. At the same time, he predicted that consumer price inflation would hold steady at 4.3 percent. The administration is looking for a sixth straight year of economic expansion, the longest in peacetime since the Civil War, to bolster the chances for a Republican presidential victory in November. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said the expansion `` gives every indication of continuing ... on into next year.'' `` Our rosy forecast was n't rosy enough,'' he told reporters. `` The economy is doing better than even we expected.'' Private analysts said <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>'s growth projections now are on target, but that his inflation forecast should be higher because of the expected effect of the widespread drought on food prices. `` He's certainly right about better growth, ... but the rest is just pie in the sky stuff,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a private economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're not going to have double-digit inflation, but a reasonable private sector forecast of consumer inflation would be 5 to 5.5 percent,'' he said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that an export-led manufacturing boom and a surge of investment spending by businesses kept the economy growing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent in the January-March period. The GNP, the broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonal and inflation-adjusted annual level of $ 3.915 trillion, a $ 34.6 billion increase from the fourth quarter of 1987. The latest figures represent a modest downward revision of a previous estimate of GNP growth in the first quarter. A month ago, the government put GNP growth at 3.9 percent. However, in April, the initial estimate was a much lower 2.3 percent. The revision showed a bigger dip in federal spending, mostly because of a decline in purchases of surplus farm commodities. The growth in consumer spending also was estimated as somewhat slower _ 3.8 percent instead of 4.3 percent. Earlier in the economic expansion, consumer spending fueled economic growth. Now, manufacture of exports, spurred by the cheaper dollar, and of equipment to help businesses to produce more exports is leading growth. `` Really, you're substituting trade and capital spending as the engines of the economy for consumption, and that's going to be the structural change for the next several years,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. Exports of goods and services were up a strong 22.8 percent in the first quarter. Business investment in capital equipment shot up 33.1 percent, the fastest rise since the fourth quarter of 1983, when the nation was beginning its recovery from the 1981-82 recession. The chief drags on growth in the quarter were federal spending, down 25.7 percent, and residential construction spending, down 8.8 percent. The GNP in the fourth quarter of 1987 grew at an even stronger a 4.8 percent annual rate. However, much of that production went into a rapid buildup in inventories of goods held on shelves and back lots. The mix of growth in the January-March period is considered better, and it occurred with little pickup in inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, slightly lower than the previously estimated 1.7 percent and well below the 2.7 percent pace of the fourth quarter. The concern now is that too much demand _ from American consumers as well as from overseas buyers _ will strain factory capacity, causing shortages and driving up prices later this year. With the second quarter of 1988 drawing to a close, the signals are mixed. Most economists are projecting slightly weaker economic growth, with estimates ranging from 2 percent to 3.5 percent. In a second report Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the after-tax profits of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations fell 1.0 percent in the first quarter, the poorest showing since profits dipped 3.7 percent in the first quarter of 1987. Profits were up a moderate 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists say lagging earnings could put pressure on businesses to raise prices.

 The nation's businesses reported a 1.0 percent decline in profits after taxes in the first three months of this year, the poorest performance in a year, the government said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said profits dipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 144.2 billion, down $ 1.4 billion from the last three months of 1987. It was sharpest drop since the first quarter of 1987, when profits fell 3.7 percent. In the second and third quarters of last year, after-tax earnings rose 4.3 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Thursday's report on the January-March period represents a downward revision from an estimate last month, when the department said profits after taxes rose 0.5 percent. Many analysts believe lagging profits are a sign of inflation because they expect companies to raise prices to make up for lost ground. However, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed most companies, remembering the painful cutbacks they had to make when imports flooded the country in the early 1980s, will be very cautious about boosting prices. `` I think companies are going to take a bit of a longer-term view and say, ` Wait a minute, if we raise prices too quickly, we may give some of that market share back to our foreign competitors,''' he said. In other details of the report, the government said: _ Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds corporations have for investment, rose 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $ 378.8 billion after a 0.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter _ Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.1 percent to an annual rate of $ 99.3 billion in the first quarter following a 2.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter _ Corporate profits before taxes were down 1.4 percent to $ 281.5 billion annual level in the first quarter following a 0.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter

<TEXT>
 A court Thursday ruled against legendary bullfighter <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, agreeing with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman who alleged he fathered her 19-year-old son, the matador's lawyer said. Attorney <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Riva </PERSON> said three members of the five-judge <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted to overturn two lower court decisions against <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>. She said her son, also named <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, was conceived while she lived with the millionaire bullfighter, known as `` El Cordobes,'' from 1968 to 1972. Two judges voted against Ms. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>, a 38-year-old <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, resident who first brought suit in 1982 against <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s most popular matador during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the decision, the majority said the 52-year-old matador's refusal to take a blood test was `` obstructionist behavior'' and a clear sign of his fear the test would prove Ms. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>'s claim <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordobes </PERSON> had argued the test represented an affront to his honor. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cordobes </ORGANIZATION> to pay the costs of Ms. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>'s original 1982 suit. It also ordered both of them to share the costs of the latest appeal. Ms. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinader </PERSON>, said he was `` greatly satisfied'' by the ruling. He said the court had not officially informed him of its decision. `` It's a good thing she has a strong heart,'' he said of <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>. `` She has suffered many injustices.'' De la <PERSON> Riva </PERSON> said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordobes </PERSON> planned to appeal the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s highest court. In 1982, represented by attorney <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON> sought an award of $ 2 million and an obligation for child support from a <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> court. She lost that suit and an appeal to a court in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, capital of the Andalusian autonomous region. Ms. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON> later dropped her demand for a cash settlement. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordobes </PERSON> and his wife of 13 years, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Freysee </PERSON>, have five children. The flamboyant bullfighter, who retired in 1981 but gave benefit performances in 1982 and 1986, emerged from humble origins to become immensely popular and wealthy during his career which lasted from 1958 to 1981. He is a businessman with a personal fortune estimated at $ 20 million.

 Two paddle-wheelers take off Friday for the annual re-creation of a historic steamboat race, but the drought that's drying up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> could prompt officials to eliminate some ports of call. The 10-day trip still will begin on schedule, said Capt. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Queen. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said Thursday that river traffic was being shut down at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to allow for dredging of the shallow river channel. But by the time the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION> and its rival <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> reach that point, the river may be open, he said. `` Hopefully, we'll be thre just at the right place at the right time,'' <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said. The company that operates both steamships said planned stops at <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Carthersville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, may have to be changed. Both ships are scheduled to steam into the port at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, under the <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arch </ORGANIZATION>, at 9 a.m. on the Fourth of July. Among precautions being taken by the steamship company to assure safe navigation of the shallower river will be the use of a towboat pushing a barge with a 9-foot draft. The tow and barge will travel ahead of the steamships, acting as a pathfinder. The `` race'' pits the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Queen against the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> in what is billed as a re-enactment of the June 24, 1870, race between the <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. However, instead of trying to match the speed of that race _ which was won by the <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in three days, 18 hours and 14 minutes _ the two modern-day steamboats will set a leisurely 10-day pace. The boats traditionally stop at <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and other ports where passengers and crew from each vessel take part in contests such as `` dueling calliopes,'' the `` Floozie Parade Competition'' and a kite flying contest. Points gained during all the events determine the winner of the `` race.''

 Senators dumped an overhauled version of their vetoed, 1,000-page bill in the hopper Thursday and expressed optimism that the measure will reach President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk this year. `` This represents a consensus on trade policy _ it's a consensus that has been a long time in coming,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., told reporters <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he saw `` an excellent chance of getting trade legislation and I'm optimistic. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said, however, that there would not be time to take up the legislation at least until late He said he wants to get all of the fiscal 1989 money bills through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> first. That timetable threatened to put the slimmed-down trade bill in a time squeeze, with some lawmakers opposed to any such legislation while others may be eager to wrap up congressional business and hit the campaign trail. A similar bill quietly went into the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hopper last week and there were signs that it might see faster action. The measure is shorn of a provision that would require companies to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and major layoffs. As the lawmakers fielded questions at a news conference, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated a separate plant-closings bill with provisions identical to those removed from the trade bill. A similar plant-closings measure was pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and lawmakers in both houses planned to vote on the measure before the July Fourth break. Democratic leaders have been saying for three weeks that prospects appear good for passage of separate plant-closings legislation. Labor unions had lobbied against detaching the plant-closings provision from the trade bill in April and refused to give in when <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders asked them to go along with dropping it. The leaders then pushed the bill with the provision intact despite predictions that it meant a sure veto. This time union leaders again lobbied against detaching the plant-closings provision. But Democratic leaders insisted on doing so, a move that insulates them from election-year charges of refusing to compromise on trade. Also dropped from the modified version of the trade bill were provisions to restrict <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> petroleum exports. They would limit exports from new oil refineries in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to 70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output. Up to 50,000 barrels a day could be exported to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but only after making a detour in an American-flagged vessel to a port in the lower 48 states. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> objected to both the plant-closings and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil provisions in his veto of the earlier version of the legislation. Central features of the measure would overhaul the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs to aid threatened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries and retaliate against international trade violations. Other features range from repeal of the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry earnings to substantial agricultural subsidy programs. One feature targeted in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message but left intact when seantors overhauled their measure would allow duty-free imports of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> ethanol, used for making gasohol. Corn producers have been fighting to get it erased. `` All you have to do is look at the drought,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` ... They're not going to have the corn for ethanol.'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> appealed for support from farm groups. `` This bill is very good farm legislation,'' he said. `` As a matter of fact I think it is the most significant agricultural legislation that I've ever seen in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' It would provide $ 1.5 billion in payments to grain companies to spur exports as well as millions of dollars to agribusinesses to advertise their wares in global markets. Under the measure, wheat, feed grains and oilseed crop producers would receive stepped-up subsidies aimed at stimulating global sales if negotiators fail to make progress on farm issues in the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of world trade talks.

It would be the second association for homosexuals in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> approved a similar association several months ago after much public debate. The Polish associations will have the right to their own publications and will be `` linked in some way to the public health service,'' he said. According to <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON>, there are about 30 male homosexuals in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> who are willing to join the association, and a much larger group which would support it. <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> said he was approached last year by a small group of homosexuals and was asked for help in winning permission for an association. He said he met personally with Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, minister of the interior, to discuss the matter. He received word that it was approved Wednesday from Deputy Health Minister <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonczak </PERSON>, he said. Homosexuality is legal in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and persecution of homosexuals is unheard of. But it is much less open than in Western countries and homosexuals have complained of intolerance and bigotry. For the first time in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last year, four representatives of the nascent gay movement appeared on television, on a late-night talk show `` Intimate Talks.'' They spoke frankly about their problems, but appeared only with their backs to the camera. The unwillingness of homosexuals to identify themselves has been considered one obstacle to the government's efforts to combat the AIDS virus in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Homosexuals have been asked to volunteer for blood tests under an ambitious government program to counter the disease, which has claimed at least three lives in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Missouri TV Station First To Be Fined Under New `Indecency' Rules</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to impose the first fine under its decency standards on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> television station for broadcasting a `` pandering and titillating'' sex comedy during prime time. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> voted 2-1 to levy the maximum $ 2,000 fine on KZKC-TV, a UHF station in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for showing the movie `` Private Lessons'' at 8 p.m., a time at which the agency said children were likely to be watching. The movie, broadcast May 26, 1987, is about a 15-year-old boy who is seduced by his housekeeper and included scenes in which the woman appeared bare-breasted. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the scenes `` were neither isolated nor fleeting.'' The commission said that while nudity and sexual themes are not necessarily `` indecent,'' their context and treatment in `` Private Lessons'' were. `` The movie included nudity and scenes depicting sexual matters which were dealt with in a pandering and titillating manner,'' the commission said. `` The story line of the seduction of a 15-year-old boy by an older woman, together with the inclusion of explicit nudity, would have commanded the attention of children and the sexual references would have been readily understood by children who tuned into the program,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, owner of KZKC-TV, said he was `` shocked and surprised and outraged by the imposition of the maximum fine in light of the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said the punishment was unfair because the standards are vague and this is the first time they have been applied to television. `` We do n't know what is indecent because the standard does n't provide any guidance,'' he said The guidelines are being challenged in court by broadcasting groups, news organizations and public interest advocates as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Media Central has not decided what action to take, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. Station officials have said the movie was edited for television by an inexperienced editor and violated its own standards for good taste but that they took immediate corrective action, including clarification of the station's policy on nudity. All three commissioners agreed that the movie was indecent and that children are likely to be in the audience before midnight, but Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said the commission has no evidence there is a substantial number of unsupervised children in the audience at that time. `` Parents, not the commission, should bear the primary responsibility of deciding what their children should watch at night,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said surveys have shown that 42 percent of all children are watching TV at 8 p.m. and that `` it is reasonable to assume that there are unsupervised children in the audience.'' Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s action was significant because `` this serves notice that we are going to enforce indecency standards'' in regard to television as well as radio stations. It marked the first indecency finding against a TV station and was the first time the agency imposed a fine under its tough new standards. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> decided in April 1987 to toughen its existing decency standards by applying the wording of a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that said indecent material is `` language or material that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.'' The commission said indecent material may be aired only when there is a reasonable risk that children are not in the audience. In a subsequent ruling in November 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider that children were not likely to be in the audience after midnight. Previously the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had considered 10 p.m. the cutoff time.

<HEAD>Debtors Threaten Premier Kenyan Hospital With Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s premier hospital may close because it is owed about $ 1.8 million, a third of it by state-controlled companies, its director said Thursday. `` We have no source of income other than fees paid by patients. I do n't see how we can continue unless debtors pay up,'' Briton <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> said of the private 194-bed <ORGANIZATION> Nairobi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. This week, he placed an advertisement in a newspaper appealing to debtors to `` search your conscience and settle your bills.'' `` If you do n't do so now, it is very possible there may be no <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to turn to next time you and yours succumb to illness,'' the ad said. <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> said the debt, owed by individuals, private and state-owned companies, international organizations and diplomatic missions, has accumulated since 1986. He refused to further identify the debtors. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Argwings-Kodhek </PERSON> said it was not feasible to take legal action because the hospital has so many debtors. The 38-year-old establishment belongs to the 1,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit company with no share capital. It employs 700 people, including 14 doctors and 300 nurses, and operates one of this East African nation's two best equipped intensive care units. Kenyans who have a choice shun the country's mismanaged state hospitals, where patients often share beds or floor space and there are drug shortages. Ill tourists, expatriate workers or diplomats traditionally go to <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Couple Works To Change Maryland State Motto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> discovered <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s motto when their son wrote a history report, and began another campaign to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to change a motto they consider sexist. The motto in Italian, `` Fatti maschii parole femine,'' means `` Manly deeds and womanly words,'' according to the state's accepted translation `` There it was right on the seal. ... It is pretty disgusting,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said recently. She and her husband have formed MOMMA, or Modernization of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Motto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Since mid-May about 400 people have signed the <ORGANIZATION> Wolfes </ORGANIZATION>' petition, which hangs on the cash register at their College Park store, the Smile Herb Shop. They hope to have 3,000 signatures on the petition when they submit it to state officials. The Wolfes are not the first to try to change the motto. In 1978, a joint resolution requested a legislative committee to devise `` a more appropriate state motto.'' `` The motto is incompatible with the equal rights and privileges accorded to women by the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' read the bill, which died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. During the past three centuries, scholars have debated the motto's proper translation. `` Deeds are of more avail than words'' and `` Act boldly but speak softly'' are among the less offensive translations, said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiverson </PERSON>, former editor of <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manual </ORGANIZATION>, a handbook of state government. <PERSON> Stiverson </PERSON> believes a corrupt translation has created the motto's sexist slant While he favors a change in the traditional translation, he said state legislative action may prove difficult. Legislators argued at length a few years ago about whether `` maschii'' should be spelled with a single `` i,'' a double `` i'' or end in the letters `` ij.'' In their campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> Wolfes </ORGANIZATION> contacted their legislator, Delegate <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. `` Frankly I'm not convinced the motto itself is sexist,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said, `` but if it is, we ought to change it.'' He said a bill would most likely change the translation, not the motto. `` My concern is to just change it so that deeds and words are not related to gender ... and so -LRB- the motto -RRB- says something positive,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Central Committee May Get New Members, Agenda Not Clear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Next week's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference may name new members to the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but it will stick to the old practice of closing the door on most of its debates, an official said Thursday. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the conference, opening Tuesday, could name new members to the 300-plus member party body that formulates policy and signs off on key personnel changes between the party congresses, which normally are held every five years. But he did not say definitely that there would be new members to replace so-called `` dead souls'' _ 60 to 70 members who have died or lost the jobs that entitled them to <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> seats since the last party congress in 1986. For many months after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced in January 1987 that he would hold the first party conference since 1941, Soviet officials and journalists predicted it would make sweeping changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to give the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader a body strongly backing his reforms. The strength of conservatives who are braking change appears to have scaled down the expectations of a sweeping personnel shakeup and radical reforms. Many <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intellectuals now say they expect the conference to be more of a dress rehearsal for a pro-reform congress in 1991, saying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have learned from this experience how to do to avoid conservative maneuvering to dominate delegate slates. <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> said Thursday that live television coverage of the conference will be limited to a broadcast of the opening session, where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will set the tone with a report on the present and future pace of reform, and a report on the closing session. Delegate speeches will be summarized on TV and printed in full in newspapers once the speakers themselves have had a chance to approve the text, <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> said. The arrangements are almost identical to those for the February 1986 congress and seem certain to disappoint the most outspoken reformers who had demanded live TV coverage of the entire meeting as a way of making the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> more accountable to the people it rules. Strengthening political accountability and the legal system are two declared goals of the 30-page conference proposals, known as theses, which have been fiercely debated in the media and at party meetings since being approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> May 23. The theses contain proposals that could dismantle the vestiges of Stalinism, but are vaguely worded in a possible attempt to fend off conservatives. <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> said hundreds of thousands of suggestions based on the theses have poured into the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is collating them for presentation to the agenda-setting presidium of the conference. He declined to specify, however, who is collating the proposals and exactly how the presidium will be selected. <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> said important representatives of each conference delegation will huddle after all 5,000 arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday. Those discussions are likely to remain secret. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptev </PERSON>, chief editor of the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, said his daily would publish details only if they were interesting. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a delegate and editor of the pro-reform weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday about 70 delegates will take the floor during the conference, which Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> has said will last through July 1. But <PERSON> Sklyarov </PERSON> and other officials refused to confirm that timetable, suggesting the duration and agenda of the conference are still open. <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> said the 106-member Georgian delegation is still meeting in his republic to decide its platform at the conference. He said he had not read the radical platforms published by the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, which demanded a form of home rule. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s demands will not be published as a program, he said, but may contain a few similar proposals for more autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Party congresses theoretically are the supreme organ of the party, usually meeting every five years to name members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and formulate policy. Party conferences, which were held infrequently before 1941 but have not been convened since then, are convened to take up special proposals.

<TEXT>
 A 1944 cargo plane hauled ambassadors instead of food supplies Thursday to mark the 40th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift, the massive Allied effort that broke a Soviet blockade of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift changed this city, and it changed the world,'' said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, who spoke at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Templehof Airport after arriving from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Thursday afternoon on the DC-3 plane, a civilian version of the military C-47 transports used during the airlift. In June 1948, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sealed off Allied road, rail and canal access to western sectors of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, an enclave 110 miles inside what was then Soviet-held territory and is now <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. During the airlift's 15 months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British cargo planes ferried more than 1.8 million tons of food, coal and other vital supplies to 2 million hungry people in the Allied-controlled sectors of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The planes that delivered the supplies came to be known as `` Raisin Bombers'' because they frequently dropped raisins and candy to the children of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Everything was in short supply _ food, clothing, everything. There was nothing left over from day to day,'' recalled <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Galler </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, one of 400 people waiting at Templehof for the plane to land. `` So when we saw these planes coming _ these ` <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bombers </ORGANIZATION>' _ we knew we did n't have to worry any longer,'' she said. Accompanying <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> were British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallaby </PERSON>, French Ambassador <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Boidevaix </PERSON>, West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>, and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorsen </PERSON>, an original airlift pilot. Earlier Thursday, the ambassadors attended the opening of an airlift exhibit in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and ceremonies at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rhine Main Air Base near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Many of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift flights orignated at Rhine Main. The airlift began on June 26, 1948, and by the time it ended on Sept. 30, 1949, more than 277,000 planeloads of food and supplies were brought into the former German capital. Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the three other victorious World War II Allies led to the Soviets move to cut <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> off from the West. Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> staunchly opposed creation of a unified German state in the three Western occupation zones. When the Allies backed a currecy reform to speed up economic recovery of war-torn <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> imposed the blockade. Four days after the money reform on June 20, the Soviets blocked all roads, waterways and railway lines. In response, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, the military governor of the American zone of conquered <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, ordered all cargo planes available to deliver provisions. The Soviets ended the blockade May 12, 1949, but the Western allies continued the flights until land, waterway and rail traffic had resumed. The airlift cost $ 200 million.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Australia Caught in Trans-Atlantic Trade War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> charged Thursday that his country's farmers are falling victim to a trans-Atlantic trade war, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged to watch out for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s interests while combating European agricultural subsidies. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, addressing a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s producers are finding themselves `` squeezed out of markets by practices which distort prices and levels of production. As a result, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the world wheat market has climbed from 29 percent to 43 percent while <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s slumped from 20 percent to 12 percent. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> must not be given to believe that while we are first-class allies, we are, in trade, second-class friends,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` We believe our relationship entitles us to a fair go in our trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in third markets,'' he added. `` Not, I emphasize, special favors, but a fair go.'' `` In agriculture we find ourselves caught in the crossfire of a destructive and counter-productive trans-Atlantic subsidies war,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, after meeting with <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We're in full agreement on the need to open up international trade in agricultural products, a keystone of both our economies. We also agree on the need to redouble our efforts toward the elimination of trade distorting government subsidies of agricultural products.'' `` Until we achieve that goal,'' he added, `` we will assure that any measures the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may take to counter unfair subsidization of agriculture will take fully into account the interests of countries like <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> `` discussed Australian concerns about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade policies'' and `` the president reassured the prime minister that it is not our purpose to damage the interests of non-subsidized agricultural producers such as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.'' In answer to a question, <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` did n't make any very specific commitments as such,'' but merely reiterated the commitment that he made to <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> on the issue during their last meeting in 1986. `` They are still concerned, but we feel that we have handled their concerns very well,'' he said. `` The president assured the prime minister that we were going to continue ... to watch very carefully the Australian export situation and that we would not do anything, as we believe we have not done anything in the past, to harm Australian markets.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> `` appreciated the president's remarks on this'' but said he `` wanted to be sure that we were always watching.'' The prime minister did not allude to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pledge in his remarks at a departure ceremony. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said the president reported to <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> on the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, from which he returned on Tuesday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought with little success at the summit to secure European support for his campaign to end agricultural subsidies by the year 2000. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is an important ally in arms-reduction negotiations. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said his talk with the president confirmed `` the strength and enduring nature'' of the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The president called attention to the facilities the two countries share in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and said they `` are essential to deterrence and to the west's ability to monitor <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> compliance with arms accords.'' In his address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> made clear that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has no intention of following the lead of its neighbor, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, in barring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships carrying nuclear weapons from its waters. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has every right to see alliances as a two-way street, to expect that allies will carry their weight,'' he said. `` I assure you that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is and will remain such an ally.'' `` We welcome your ships and aircraft to our ports and airfields.''

 Mischievous Israeli children and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers seeking retaliation set some of the blazes that have scorched thousands of acres of land since May, Israeli officials and Palestinian landowners said Thursday. Arab arsonists destroyed most of the 35,000 acres of greenery torched since this spring. Underground Arab leaders called an `` Arson Day'' on Wednesday, and nine of the 14 fires which broke out apparently were set by Palestinians, police said. But a rarely mentioned fact is that Israelis are responsible for some of the blazes, despite the importance the Jewish state places on cultivating the land. Settlers living in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> burned more than 400 acres of wheat crops and olive trees in the past month on Arab-owned land near the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, according to Palestinian farmers. They said the settlers appeared to be acting in retaliation for attacks by Arabs during the 6 -LCB- - month uprising against Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> The Arab farmers' complaints were backed by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, which reported settlers were suspected of setting at least eight recent fires in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Israeli police officials in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said they could not confirm the reports. In addition, some recent fires in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were set by Jewish children who acted `` just for the fun of it,'' Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Three 9-year-old Jewish boys were caught this week starting a fire in a field near the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said the three were simply mischievous, but <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> declined to elaborate. Israeli soldiers are a third group which causes some fires. Troops sometimes unwittingly ignite fields and trees by gunfire or flares during target practice or border combat, <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanania </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In fact, one of the worst blazes Wednesday was caused by soldiers who shot flares in a grove of avocado trees as they chased a squad of Palestinian guerrillas near the Lebanese border, <PERSON> Hanania </PERSON> said. He said training accidents were the cause of dozens of fires in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in recent months, but he declined to be more specific. The army routinely refuses to comment on damage or casualties caused during military training. Most of the fires set since May were inside pre-1967 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> also have been victims. Farmer <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Amran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burein </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said he saw 2 -LCB- acres of his wheat crop go up in flames on June 6 after men wearing Jewish skullcaps parked a van by his field. `` I saw three settlers park near my land. Shortly afterward I saw the field engulfed in smoke,'' <PERSON> Amran </PERSON> said. In another case, two shepherds employed by <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moati </PERSON> <PERSON> Silwada </PERSON> of Rash Rash village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said they saw two gun-toting Jewish settlers set a fire that razed 2 -LCB- acres of fig and olive groves on June 13. Attorney <PERSON> Muna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rishmawi </PERSON> of Law in the Service of Man, an Arab affiliate of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION>, said details of such cases were being gathered for publication.

<HEAD>GAO To Look at Perot's Postal Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Senate-ordered investigation may delay completion of a study by billionaire businessman <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> to find ways of saving money at the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Senate has requested the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to investigate terms of the deal, and directed the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to delay phase two of the contract. Postal officials, meanwhile, defended the deal Thursday and said they welcomed the investigation. `` Although we are aware that adverse statements about the contacrt are emanating from would-be competitors of Mr. <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> _ and are presenting a distorted view of this opportunity to bring his vast business experience to bear on resolving some of our problems _ we believe this contract is an appropriate step that is consistent with our ongoing efforts to prepare the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the future,'' the agency said in a statement. The $ 500,000 deal, calling for computer specialist <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> to analyze postal operations and recommend cost-saving changes, was announced June 2. It was to last for 90 days, and be followed by a second phase in which <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> would be paid a percentage of any savings the service realized from implementing his recommendations. `` It's a beautiful arrangement for <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, but not so pretty for the postal customers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will pay the costs for the first phase, then the <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> company gets a cut of the savings, if phase two is successful. Also critical of the the deal, which was not opened to competitive bids, were Sens. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution called on the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> to look into the contract and report back within 45 days. It also called on the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to delay implementation of any second phase of the contract for a further 45 days to give the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> time to study the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report. Thus, if the study suggests changes in postal operations, implementation could be delayed by a month or so.

 A greenhouse that provided herbs from the urban jungle for plates in posh restaurants has gone bankrupt after seven years. The demise of Glie Farms, known officially as <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenhouse </ORGANIZATION>, put more than 80 residents of the blighted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> neighborhood out of work. `` They're no longer there.

This week, the <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> removed rows of unkempt herbs after neighbors complained of the rotting smell. But the empty greenhouses still may see future harvests. `` Something will be grown at <LOCATION> Bathgate </LOCATION> in their wake; we're optimistic,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said Thursday Glie Farms was founded in 1981, with the help of a federal grant, as a non-profit venture to provide jobs for runaway youths. After several years, it became a for-profit venture, building up a clientele of 800 restaurants and 15 supermarket chains and grossing as much as $ 250,000 a month. `` Glie Farms was a real Cinderella story,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Menge </PERSON>, the purchasing director for the Four Seasons restaurant in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` But that's the food business. You see so many companies come and go.'' Glie founder <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldron </PERSON> said his principal problem had been difficulty in securing a $ 1.5 million loan that he negotiated last year to start a farm in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 Mud and rock loosened by rain roared down on a mountain village and highway Thursday, burying up to 100 people, including 30 travelers stranded in a coffee house by an earlier landslide, officials said. State television said villagers reported hearing people cry out for help from beneath the ooze and rubble. `` It happened all at once after a noise that sounded like thunder. The rocks swept away everything in a second,'' said <PERSON> Turan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alemdar </PERSON>, a trucker who saw the disaster, as quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Hurriyet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Another witness, <PERSON> Zeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilha </PERSON>, was quoted as saying: `` I saw the mountain coming at me and started running away.'' Rescuers were hampered by rain. Another landslide at 8 p.m. forced a suspension of the rescue work, but caused no casualties, the television reported from <LOCATION> Catak </LOCATION> village, 500 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> region is known for frequent landslides, some of which are blamed on extensive cutting of forests. <PERSON> Enver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hizlan </PERSON>, the provincial governor, said only one body had been recovered. Earlier reports said three were found. Deputy Gov. <PERSON> Haydar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozgun </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone the rescue work would resume when landslide experts declared it safe. The <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said huge searchlights were set up. <PERSON> Safa </PERSON> <PERSON> Giray </PERSON>, federal public works minister, flew to the site. State radio said 31 people were injured by the landslide in a mountainous area of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> province. Tons of mud and rock covered at least three houses, four stores, a restaurant and the coffee house crowded with at least 30 bus passengers stranded by an earlier landslide, the news agencies reported. A high school also was buried but no children were there because of summer vacation. Several buses and cars were on the road when the landslide hit, <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> reported. Television said it also clogged a river, which flooded the village, and showed footage of submerged houses. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> quoted a supervising official, not identified, as saying rescuers might need two weeks to clear the debris if the rain continued. It said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were at the scene. Two minibuses were uncovered but no one was inside, the news reports said. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, the Moslem equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, sent 150 tents to the area, <PERSON> Antatolia </PERSON> said. A dispatch by <ORGANIZATION> Hurriyet </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> announced over loudspeakers at scene that 300 people had been killed, causing a temporary panic. Officials at the scene and elsewhere estimated the number buried at 100 or fewer.

<HEAD>House Keeps Family Provision in Housing Discrimination Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Thursday refused to kill a proposal barring discrimination in housing for families with children. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected on a vote of 289-116 an amendment proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., that would have stripped the protection for families with children from legislation designed to strengthen the enforcement of the nation's fair housing law Under the bill, families with children under 18 could not be refused housing except in retirement communities where at least 90 percent of the tenants are 55 or older and the facilities are specifically designed for the physical or social needs of retirees. Any community renting to those 62 or older would be exempt even if it did not provide special facilities. Final action on the bill was delayed as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recessed for the day to attend the funeral services of Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, R-Tenn., in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> The bill is expected to be taken up again late next week. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said they would take up the bill after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approves it, indicating that the legislation may go to the White House before the end of summer. Civil rights groups and Realtors earlier this week ended a 20-year battle by reaching a compromise to put teeth in the basic fair-housing law while still satisfying President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s concerns about constitutional guarantees. The bill would give the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> the power to bring actions on behalf of individual victims of discrimination, would ban discrimination against the disabled and would forbid limitations on renting to families with children, except in the clearly defined retirement communities. Under the compromise, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would be required to investigate complaints of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. And it would be authorized to lodge charges if it finds `` reasonable cause'' to believe that discrimination may have occurred. At that point, there would be an administrative proceeding unless either the plaintiff or the defendant requests a jury trial; either proceeding could lead to imposition of fines or injunctions and could be appealed to a higher court. The compromise language which gives the accused the right to a civil trial by jury was introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 401-0. The House also passed by voice vote an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., which would permit the exclusion of an individual who threatens the safety of others and one by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., to take away protection of the law from anyone convicted of drug The Shaw amendment would have eliminated the provisions of the bill extending protection from housing discrimination to families with children under the age of 18. It would have required the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a study on the nature and extent of housing discrimination against familes with children and report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within three years.

 The government has sharply raised the bonuses it pays to farms for grain in a major new effort to stimulate production and cut imports, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday.

Bonuses for grain production were introduced last year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> secretary, apparently believed the time was ripe to increase the incentives. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the sharp increases in bonuses were aimed primarily at stimulating production of high-quality grains. `` The noted bonuses are paid out when the quality of production meets the demands of state standards,'' the report said. The bonus for durum wheat was raised to 150 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say what the earlier level was. This means that if any farm produces more durum wheat than the state orders, any surplus is bought for the regular price plus 150 percent of that price. Bonuses were also raised for increased production of other grain products. The new bonuses are to take effect July 1, but one Western diplomat familiar with Soviet agriculture said he doubts there will be any quick results. `` It's like telling a football team at the end of the third quarter that if you win the game, you'll get a $ 5,000 bonus instead of a $ 2,000 bonus. It just comes too late,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Soviet grain production has consistently fallen below targeted levels, and this has forced the country to make large imports. Last year's harvest was 211.4 million tons. This was an improvement since larger shortfalls in previous years. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates Soviet grain production this year will amount to 215 million tons. The targeted level is 235 million tons. Under an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually.

<HEAD>Strikers Assault Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking autoworkers demanding a 50 percent pay increase assaulted the mayor of the Slovenian city of <LOCATION> Maribor </LOCATION> on Thursday as he tried to calm them down, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the workers were angred by a report that most of the strikers from the TAM truck and military vehicle factory had returned to work, and Mayor <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuk </PERSON> tried to soothe them. `` Instead, he hardly managed to escape an assault of several angry persons,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said, without elaborating. The incident took place in the northern <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> city when strikers reportedly refused to accept a proposed 7.5 percent pay increase. A company spokesman said Thursday that about 4,000 of the employees had returned to work. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said that 1,500 TAM workers were joined by 3,000 workers from three other plants and marched to the center of the city. It added that the workers began dispersing around noon. Sources said police blocked off one downtown street, but no arrests were made. The 5,000 employees of TAM went on strike Tuesday seeking higher wages. Several hundred workers from four other plants in the Slovenian city joined the walkout in the first such show of solidarity reported in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> said as many as 7,500 workers were involved. The strikers claim their wages threaten minimum standards of living. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is planning to reduce inflation to 90 percent this year, compared with an average 170 percent last year. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economy, a mixture of free-market elements and Soviet-style central planning, has been growing at a sluggish rate averaging less than 1 percent annually over the past six years. The government on Saturday launched an austerity program that included substantial price increases, wage cuts of up to 30 percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the dinar, the national currency.

<HEAD>House Ethics Panel to Probe Congressman in Loan Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee announced Thursday it is launching a formal preliminary investigation into whether Rep. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., violated the law or <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in seeking a loan that he knew was being financed by drug proceeds The panel, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, said it had recieved evidence `` reasonably indicating'' that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> may have departed from acceptable standards in seeking to negotiate the $ 850,000 loan. Secretly taped conversations reported last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> showed that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was advised by an undercover agent that the money almost certainly came from drug trafficking, but he continued to pursue the transaction for a month. The two-term congressman was seeking to refinance a construction loan on his $ 1.2 million home in <LOCATION> Stone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and convert it to a long-term mortgage. An aide to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, said the ethics committee had `` done what we asked them to do.'' He said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> had sought the investigation and was confident he would be cleared of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was on his way back to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> for the weekend and unavailable for comment, <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> said. A preliminary inquiry is the first step in an ethics committee investigation. If the panel finds reason to believe that the alleged violation in fact occurred, it makes a formal statement of the violation and can ultimately recommend disciplinary action. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> ultimately backed out of the deal after being told he would have to accept the cash loan in person and sign a receipt for it. `` The only reason I ca n't do that is I would then be essentially laundering y' all's money,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent, according to the Constitution `` In other words, if <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> -LRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, who has subsequently been indicted on money-laundering charges -RRB- wants to launder y' all's money, fine, but I ca n't do that, and to sign a receipt of cash would be to do that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, at a town meeting in his congressional district last week, apologized for his behavior and asked voters to forgive him. `` I did entertain the idea, and it was wrong,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said. But he said he had no intention of resigning, and `` I hope -LRB- voters -RRB- will find it in their hearts to forgive what I have done.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who faces a tough re-election battle this fall, said he was tempted to accept the loan because of financial pressures stemming from cost overruns on the large new house he was building. But he said he backed away when he became convinced the transaction was illicit. `` When it was between myself and my maker, I made the right decision,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, took a lot of heat in the months after the stock market crash for seeing the world through rose-colored glasses and predicting strong, steady economic growth this year Many private economists had issued deeply pessimistic projections, fearing that the Oct. 19 market collapse, when investors lost $ 500 billion in a single day, would shock consumers into cutting back and topple the country into a recession. But the actual performance of the economy as measured by the gross national product _ 4.8 percent annual growth in the fourth quarter of 1987 and 3.6 percent growth in the first three months of this year _ made even the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> estimates look too gloomy. `` Our rosy forecast was n't rosy enough. The economy is doing better than even we expected,'' a smiling, confident <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday. He said the administration now expects the economy to grow 3.5 percent, year-over-year, in 1988, compared with an earlier projection of 2.9 percent. The forecast of average unemployment is moving from 5.8 percent to 5.5 percent And despite fears of inflation by stock and bond traders, he said he's holding steady on his prediction for consumer price inflation of 4.3 percent and expects only an average increase in interest rates of half a percentage point. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, responding to a reporter's question at a picture-taking session, said he's not worried about inflation either. `` All the evidence shows us that our recovery is going on and, no, there is no great threat of inflation,'' the president said. Private analysts found little fault with the administration's new growth estimate, but they said its optimistic view of inflation fails to take into account the potentially devastating effect on food prices of the drought scorching crops in the nation's `` He's certainly right about better growth ... but the rest is just pie in the sky stuff,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an economic consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> conceded the drought could have `` a significant effect on food prices,'' but said it is too soon to say how significant. `` We can not guess because I do n't know whether it's going to rain. I hope soon,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the six-to-10-day outlook for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> calls for more hot, dry weather. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> noted, however, that the farm community generates only about 2 percent of the gross national product. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, said, `` I think almost everyone is underestimating how devastating the drought can be to food prices.'' He noted that food makes up about one-fifth the consumer price index. `` I think the shading of the administration's estimates on inflation may involve at least some election year politics in addition to economic analysis,'' he said. `` I think what the administration is trying to do is present a picture of strong economic growth and low inflation as we come into an election.'' But <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said, `` Our economy is not overheating, as sometimes feared.'' He said the administration bases its inflation predictions on the expectation that economic growth will slow somewhat in the remaining nine months of they year from the first-quarter pace. He said growth projections for 1989 and beyond were being revised downward slightly to offset the upward revision for 1988 and the stronger-than-expected growth experienced during 1987. For 1989, the administration expects the economy to grow 3.1 percent. `` For those of you who are always trying to figure out what we are thinking, it means we envision some decline in interest rates later this year,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its warplanes bombed 10 Iranian oil installations Thursday in the heaviest air raids on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s economic backbone in weeks The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said six production installations in the <LOCATION> Ahwaz </LOCATION> oilfields in southwestern <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province were set on fire. Later, two installations at the <LOCATION> Bibi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hakimah </LOCATION> oilfield, 120 miles to the southeast, were bombed and set ablaze, <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said. The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Another formation of jets hit two pumping stations at the <LOCATION> Gash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saran </LOCATION> field north of <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakimah </PERSON> at about the same time, leaving them shrouded in flames and smoke, the agency said. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said its jet fighters flew 113 missions and its helicopter gunships 30 missions and all returned safely to their bases. There was no independent confirmation of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets bombed `` a residential area and labor quarters'' in the <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION> area, killing one civilian. The agency said other unspecified areas also were bombed. But it made no mention of oil installations being hit. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> denied residential areas were hit, saying the bombing `` was confined to striking installations at oilfields and Iranian military positions.'' <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military communique as saying the raids were a message to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that `` it has lost the war in all fields and that there is no alternative to save <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from total deterioration but to accept peace.'' Thursday's raids were the first significant attacks on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s vital oil installations on land since early May, when fighter-bombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemical plants The air force also has attacked several Iranian oil tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in its campaign to choke off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil exports which <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> needs to pay for its war effort. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1s carried out a long-range 1,500-mile raid on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal in the Strait of Hormuz May 14. Five tankers were set on fire. They included the world's largest vessel, the 564,739-ton <ORGANIZATION> Seawise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION>, which was badly damaged. The Iraqi air offensive inflicted considerable damage on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil infrastructure in March and April, oil industry and diplomatic sources reported Refineries were repeatedly hit. Oil industry sources have reported that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been forced to import unprecedented amounts of refined products, such as aviation fuel and kerosene, because its refinery production has been badly reduced. Despite the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has maintained its oil production at around an average of 2.3 million barrels a day, with exports of around 1.4 million barrels a day, the respected Middle East Economic Survey reported. That's about the mimimum level <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs to maintain to earn sufficient revenue to keep its war effort going. Oil revenue accounts for some 95 percent of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign exchange earnings. Oil sales earned $ 20 billion a year in 1983, but plummeted to only around $ 6 billion in 1986 when oil prices collapsed. The Iranians have suffered two major battlefield defeats in recent weeks, which along with political in-fighting in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and economic woes, have pushed them on the defensive for the first time in several years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s air force has been concentrating on attacking Iranian troop buildups in the past few weeks as the land war heated up, with the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> abandoning its long-held strategy of static defense to go on the offensive for the first time in six years.

<HEAD>High-Rise Apartments Planned for Black Township</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A company said Thursday it plans to build the first high-rise apartment complex in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the vast black township where tens of thousands of people live in shacks because of a housing shortage. The project envisions 40,000 people would be able to live in 7,000 to 8,000 apartments in buildings up to 25 stories. Two dozen schools will be built in six three-story buildings nearby, according to the $ 230 million plan by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The highest building in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, where an estimated 2.5 million people live on 40 square miles of low hills, is now a 10-story nurses' dormitory. Aside from a few two-story houses in higher-income neighborhoods, Sowetans live on small lots in one-story houses. Many have outside toilets and no bathrooms. Most homes now have running water and electricity, but squatters, relatives and friends of householders live by the thousands in shacks, sheds and garages. There are relatively few apartment buildings for blacks anywhere in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The proposed Soweto complex would house 40,000 people where two hostels previously accommodated 4,000. The non-profit foundation said a studio apartment in the new complex would be sold rather than rented and would cost about $ 6,000. It said that compared to an average $ 6,500 for a serviced plot of land without a house in a township. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid laws require blacks to live in segregated townships, most of them relatively far from urban centers where they work. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and have separate schools and health services. Anti-apartheid activists accuse of the government of restricting the available land for black housing to control the numbers of blacks in urban areas. One result has been massive squatter camps. The government recently announced a plan to add vacant land to the black townships around <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> for more black housing. One proposed community north of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> may be designated as an area where people of any race could live.

 The annual Festival of Two Worlds opened Thursday night in the medieval hilltown of <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, amid projections the event would surpass last year's attendance figures. The Joffrey Ballet, the renowned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dance company, kicked off the 18-day program with an Italian premiere of `` Light Rain,'' followed by <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s `` Rite of Spring,'' the prototype of modern dance first performed in 1913. Among the highlights of the 1988 festival will be Polish-born director <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Polanski </PERSON>'s presentation of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s surrealist `` Metamorphosis,'' and a new tragedy by Italian playwright <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Missiroli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Missiroli </PERSON>'s work explores the relationship between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s fascist dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> and his mistress, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Petacci </PERSON>, in the setting of the country's fascist upheaval of the 1930s and 1940s. The festival includes three operas, five ballets, 11 plays and 47 concerts, in addition to art exhibits and film showings. Ticket sales have so far outpaced last year's advance sales, according to a festival spokesman, who added that most of the performances for the first five days have been sold out. Organizers said Thursday they are optimistic this year's attendance will exceed the 1987 levels of more than 100,000 visitors, despite a production schedule containing 60 fewer performances than last year Last year the festival earned $ 650,000 from ticket sales, far short of the $ 4 million in costs. <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON>, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and founder of the festival, chose the ancient setting of <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> in 1957 with the aim of merging the cultural worlds of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own remains <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s own for now as the lawsuit against the blue-eyed star who also operates Salad King got temporarily tossed Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoarski </PERSON> declared a mistrial in the case of a delicatessen owner seeking some profits from the actor's food enterprises, but the plaintiff said he will sue again. The judge decided on the mistrial after jurors said they were unable to ignore depositions that were inadvertently turned over to them Wednesday. The papers had not been admitted as evidence. He reversed a ruling he made a few minutes earlier when he instructed jurors to disregard copies of depositions from <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> deli owner <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> and others involved in the case. A note delivered to the judge just before noon said, `` Some members do not feel an unbiased opinion can be rendered in light of their reading of an amount of the depositions.'' After reading the note, <PERSON> Zoarski </PERSON> said he had no choice but to order a mistrial. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said a mistrial `` is one of those things that happens,'' and he vowed to pursue the lawsuit he filed five years ago. Attorneys for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> indicated they would file a motion within five days asking the judge to decide the case in their favor. Both sides ruled out a settlement. Jurors were ordered not to talk about the case after the mistrial, but some indicated to reporters that the panel was n't close to reaching a verdict <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassi </PERSON>, jury foreman and a philosophy professor at <ORGANIZATION> Fairfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said a number of jurors were `` extremely disappointed.'' `` As of tomorrow it -LRB- the trial -RRB- would have lasted exactly one month and this month has been wasted now,'' <PERSON> Grassi </PERSON> said. The jury, which had deliberated eight hours over two days, was sent home Wednesday after its foreman told the court that it had received depositions from Gold and some defendants, and wanted to see <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s attorney, said Wednesday it appeared the clerk who took exhibits into the jury room inadvertently also took the depositions. Gold alleged that an attorney for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> promised him 8 percent of the stock from <ORGANIZATION> Newman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Own </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said he contributed 30 months' effort to <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s company and believed his work led to the corporation's success Gold sued <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>; his two food companies, <ORGANIZATION> Newman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Own </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; author A.E. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, and food distributor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON>'s company. The defendants denied all of the allegations. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade and popcorn, has donated $ 15 million to charity since 1982. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said he once considered giving a gift of stock to four people who contributed to the food venture but <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> was not among them. He also said he decided not to give away any stock after his lawyer advised him against it.

<HEAD>US Trade Chief Sees Possible Escalation of Farm Subsidy War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRAINERD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> on Thursday raised the prospect of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escalation of the already-costly farm subsidy battle unless progress is made on eliminating all subsidies by the year 2000. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could very likely increase export subsidies, just as it did in 1985, if it appears that current global trade negotiations on the matter are at a stalemate. `` Sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in order to achieve progress,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said at a news conference held during trade talks with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest trading partners. The two days of discussions with trade ministers from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the 12-member European Community come on the heels of the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, where farm subsidies were a major item of dispute. The allies rebuffed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for totally scrapping subsidies. The final economic communique simply repeated language calling for further negotiations aimed at reducing subsidies rather than eliminating them. The world leaders directed their trade ministers to keep negotiating, but officials said they did not expect any breakthrough in this round of talks, being held at a resort in the lake country of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The trade ministers reported after the first session Thursday morning that significant progress was being made in other areas, particularly a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to speed up the process for settling trade disputes before the 96-member General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the Geneva-based organization which governs world trade. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is conducting the current round of trade liberalization talks, known as the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round because they were launched at a conference in that country in 1986. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and his counterparts were hoping to narrow their differences on a variety of issues from trade in services to foreign investment so that progress can be made at a key <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> meeting in December, the halfway point for the current trade round. However, there are fears that the dispute over agriculture has become so contentious that it could jeopardize progress in other areas. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said that unless progress is made at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> meeting, pressure will build in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to further subsidize American farmers so they can cmpete on world markets. He said congressional frustration would probably result in a new farm bill being taken up next year rather than in 1990, when the current subsidy program is due to expire. `` I am not making legislative threats. I am just giving you an assessment of what could happen,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. The 1985 farm bill significantly boosted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidy payments to help American farmers stay competitive on world markets. Last year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government spent $ 26 billion on farm support programs. Japanese Trade Minister <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said his country was already upset over the congressional insistence on passing an omnibus trade bill this year. A version minus the plant-closing provision that prompted a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto has begun working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said the new bill still contained many protectionist provisions to which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> objects. `` We have a strong belief that good sense will prevail and the president will not sign the bill,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not said what he would do if a second bill reaches his desk, although congressional sponsors are predicting he will sign it. All nations agree in principle that farm subsidies are a major drain on their treasuries, but Europeans claim that political pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support programs. Instead, they are arguing for an effort to reduce the subsidies to a less costly level, perhaps one-half of where supports are currently. <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the world's largest food importer in 1970, is now second to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the amount of food it exports. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still the world's largest exporter of farm commodities, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the volume of wheat and feed grains sold on world markets. But since reaching a record of $ 41.7 billion in 1981, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports steadily declined for five years, falling to a low of $ 26.6 billion in 1986. They posted a slight increase to $ 29 billion in 1987. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's push to reduce farm subsidies through trade negotiations has generated very little reaction among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm lobbying groups because they believe in part that the American stand is just a bargaining position and will not actually result in scrapping all subsidies.

Trial was scheduled for Aug. 18. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said his office found insufficient evidence to warrant an assault charge against the 62-year-old <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> but believed he should be charged with possession of an unregistered firearm. The city government traditionally handles weapons charges, and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION>, said officials would and decide within a few days whether to prosecute <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has written frequently of the need for stringent handgun control, refused to discuss the court developments with a reporter. `` I am not saying one word about that decision,'' he said when reached by telephone at his home by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think I've been very generous in talking to the media, and I've said all I'm going to say.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities the .22 - caliber handgun used in the shooting had belonged to his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> maintained that his son had been told by city officials he did not need to register the weapon when he left the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance says that all weapons must be registered. Possession of an unregistered handgun or ammunition carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. Neither <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> nor Ms. <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> would comment after their court appearance, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s parents criticized <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s handling of the incident. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> acknowledged that his son had committed an `` unlawful act'' by entering <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s yard. But, he added: `` Was that act cause for Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> to shoot <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and possibly kill him?'' <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said her son's judgment `` certainly showed immaturity, but Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s judgment is appalling.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has said he called police after hearing noises in his backyard, investigating and finding four people in his pool. The columnist said he fired at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> after the young man lunged at him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> disputes that, saying he was trying to flee when he was shot. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> face a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $ 400 fine if convicted. The two had been charged with illegal entry shortly after the incident, but those charges were withdrawn within hours pending an investigation of the case.

 A family is feeding worms to a nestful of baby sparrow hawks after the birds' parents apparently abandoned them to search for water and food amid the lingering drought. Five baby American kestrels, a type of small falcon commonly known as a sparrow hawk, plopped down at the picnic table of <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawver </PERSON>'s home in this community Monday. Family members have been giving worms to the brown-speckled birds, which are members of a federally protected species. `` Sunday, I saw a bird out my window that I thought was an owl,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Shawver </PERSON>. She now believes the bird was probably the adult bird just as it was abandoning the nest. The next day, she found the babies, who are about 6 inches long and will grow to up to 12 inches. The birds happily dined on worms that the family had gathered to feed a pet turtle, she said. `` They were gobbling them up like crazy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shawver </PERSON> said. Because the kestrels, like all birds of prey, are protected by federal law, Ms. <PERSON> Shawver </PERSON> notified State Game Protector <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> said it was not normal for parent birds to leave a nest like that. `` More than likely it was the lack of water and insects that prompted the birds to abandon the nest,'' <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> said. `` There was not enough food for the parents to survive, so they left.'' While it is illegal to possess the kestrels, dead or alive, the Shawvers will be allowed to feed the baby birds so long as they are not confined in any way, <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> said. The birds are gradually getting adult feathers, Ms. <PERSON> Shawver </PERSON> said. `` You can see them changing every day,'' she said. `` The female is the most aggressive. She is bigger than the rest. She seems to stand up by herself a lot.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and spokesmen for postal workers expressed alarm Thursday over the shipment of biological toxins and other deadly agents through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail system, saying the items are not properly packaged at times. But officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, both shippers of such items, defended their procedures and said elaborate packaging precautions are taken. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it is considering tighter regulations that would ban the shipment of some disease-causing agents and microorganisms from its mail service. The action is being considered because an expected increase in such shipments through the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> could cause a possible hazard to postal workers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Henselton </PERSON>, assistant postmaster general, said at a congressional hearing. The proposed regulation was to be issued Thursday followed by a 45-day comment period before a final rule is taken under consideration, he said. Many of the shipments of disease-related agents already are shipped by private overnight carriers. The Postal Service's assurances did not ease some of the concern expressed by members of a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` These viruses are intended for warfare, they're intended to kill people,'' declared Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., adding that they should not go through the regular mail system <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, called plans by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to expand its shipment of toxic materials through the postal system `` bizarre'' and a `` devious scheme'' that should be rejected. He said that at the very least the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should require a permit to ship toxic specimens `` and should require advance notice before it is presented for acceptance into the mailstream.'' Eighteen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> earlier this month expressing their concerns about the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to expand the shipment of toxins by registered mail from research centers around the country to a proposed testing center at the Dugway Proving Grounds in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Such shipments, said Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., `` will expose postal workers and the general public to an unacceptable health risk. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has gone `` to great lengths'' to describe the safety precautions being taken at the proposed laboratory but shows a lack of concern with shipping safeguards. Thousands of toxins and disease agents are shipped through the postal service by private laboratories as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, witnesses said. While the shipments require strict packaging, in some cases up to five layers of packing, there still are spills, witnesses said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miss </PERSON>, a Postal Service mail handler from <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he and his colleagues frequently have observed shipments that are not properly packaged. Miss said that last November he came across a dripping styrofoam parcel containing flu vaccine, which dripped over his hands and onto his apron. `` Though the spill did not result in an illness it points to a potential threat,'' he told the subcommittee.

 <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they had settled a lawsuit that the star of `` A Prairie Home Companion'' brought alleging copyright infringement. The terms of the settlement call for <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION>, through <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>, to make available free to people who request them 400 cassettes of a disputed speech <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> made in October 1987 at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The speech covered various topics and promoted his book, `` Leaving Home.'' <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION>, which long has transmitted <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon appearances to member stations, included the speech in its catalog of cassettes for sale. In his lawsuit, filed in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said he never gave the radio network permission to use the speech. `` It was an expensive suit and they tried to punish me as much as possible and make it cost as much as possible by going through days of tortuous depositions, and after they put us all through the grinder as far as they could, they agreed to stop doing what I was suing them to stop doing,'' he said in an interview Thursday. `` I never wanted any money from them, and there was never any money asked for,'' he said. `` I just wanted them to leave my work alone.'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> had sought in the suit to have all unsold tapes destroyed and a list of people who had bought the tapes. He also had asked for unspecified damages and attorneys fees. <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> defended its sale of the cassette, saying it handled <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s appearance before the press club no differently than it handled talks by others. The nonprofit radio network said it has distributed tapes of those events to the public through its cassette catalog since 1979 and has more than 130 titles. <ORGANIZATION> Spoken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which produces and distributes some cassettes for <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION>, was included in the settlement. Officials at Spoken Arts were out of the office and not available for comment. <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> said it believes <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s book publicist was aware when he arranged the appearance that cassettes would be distributed and that <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> also was aware of the arrangements. `` NPR thinks it is important to preserve its right to distribute programs and cassettes of press club appearances as part of its service to the listening public,'' the radio network said. <PERSON> Keiller </PERSON>'s nationally broadcast variety show, `` A Prairie Home Companion,'' which was produced by <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and distributed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, was discontinued a year ago.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Thursday that, after a long discussion with a top aide to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he thinks there'll be no quick decision on a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. Meanwhile, a political adviser to both <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor had agreed to stump the nation in support of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he had talked Wednesday with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, who is leading the effort to find a running mate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, about the vice presidential selection process and came away with the impression that it would take awhile. `` They do not seem to me the kind of people who would make precipitous judgments or very early judgments,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` I do n't expect a quick decision.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> talked about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor's role, but he did not provide details. He noted that a Dukakis-Cuomo ticket was not discussed. `` That's not even a question,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> did n't return telephone messages left at his office. Meanwhile, former <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Giudice </PERSON> said the governor would soon be helping the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in other ways. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people want him to talk in other parts of the country, getting out the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> agenda and talking about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Giudice </PERSON>, a Wall Street investment banker who served as chief of staff to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> during the governor's first term. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Giudice </PERSON> helped put together <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' successful <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign. The former <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aide said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor would `` take a very active role'' in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and had already scheduled speaking engagements in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, once considered a possible 1988 Democratic presidential candidate himself, remained neutral through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary and did n't endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> until the primary season ended June 7. By then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already had the nomination sewed up.

<HEAD>US Official Says Soviet Withdrawal `Well Under Way'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The withdrawal of Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is `` well under way'' with the Russians pulling out their troops on schedule, a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official testified Thursday. `` So far we see no evidence that the Soviets do not intend to meet their troop withdrawal deadlines on Aug. 15 and Feb. 15, 1989,'' Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> resisted demands by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> immediately appoint an ambassador at large to deal with the Afghan resistance movement. He indicated that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration prefers to wait until a full-fledged government emerges that has widespread support of the Afghan people before extending any sort of official or informal recognition. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who testified before the committee, also asked that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan refugees be doubled. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international organizations, said emphasis is being put on organizing a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> relief and resettlement program for the Afghan people, some 5.5 million of whom are refugees in either <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said that in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have made about $ 142 million in relief funds available for Afghan refugees. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does not intend to seek a supplemental appropriation to provide additional funds for the period because of budget constraints, he said, adding: `` Our continuing programs are consistent with, supportive of and will be closely coordinated with the U.N. effort.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is encouraging other nations to make substantial contributions to the Afghan relief effort administered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> `` In our appeals we point out that we are by far the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghans and that others should now assume a major share of the new burden as the refugees begin their return home,'' he said. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> also made clear that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is being asked to bear a large share of the costs. `` It destroyed the country of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It is obligated to pay a major part of the bill to rebuild it,'' he said. `` But its contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> must come without strings or any requirements that the funds be used to bolster the illegitimate <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime.'' He said the Soviets also should help in eliminating the danger posed by the thousands of landmines thay have planted on Afghan territory.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced his backing Thursday for $ 115 million in new taxes to `` make sure the state's fiscal base is solid and strong'' and also faced questions about his administration's acquisition of land for a new prison _ a deal now under scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> On the Republican side, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had breakfast with former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> while an independent group called `` Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' announced plans to spend $ 10 million supporting him in the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he's made up his mind about the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination but wo n't reveal his decision unless asked by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Making two long-awaited fiscal decisions certain to provide campaign ammunition to the Republicans, the Democratic governor announced he had signed a $ 40 million cigarette tax and favored raising another $ 75 million by bringing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> tax code in line with federal tax law changes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had balanced nine state budgets, a record he characterized as in `` sharp contrast'' to that of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I think the people of this state and the people of this country can recognize when someone is talking about fiscal responsibility and someone who is doing it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Constitution requires the governor to balance the budget although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has twice inherited deficits. In statements issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged it has opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if federal laws were violated in connection with a proposal to place a new state prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not the subject of an investigation,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Residents of the rural community of 800 people waged a bitter fight against placement of the medium-security prison in their area and some opponents have contended that the current owners of the 700-acre parcel had inside information that the property would be chosen as the site of the new prison. A development firm owned by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> bought the land from the Seventh Day <ORGANIZATION> Adventist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 for $ 3 million. They have offered to sell it to the state for $ 9.5 million. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> and his wife contributed $ 1,000 each to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign, the maximum allowed by law Asked about the deal, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, `` The process was as open as it could possibly be. ... We have very tough procedures for the acquisition of property.'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> grew up near each other in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. The governor told a statehouse news conference upon his return from Fall River that he was unaware who owned the land when he chose it as a prison site. `` One of them grew up around the corner from me and I remember shoverling his parents' driveway,'' he said. `` Any suggestions that the secretary of human services and his staff proceeded other than in accordance with the law and strict standards of integrity are unfortunate and regrettable.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added a new element to speculation over whether he is interested in the vice presidential nomination when he was asked in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> whether he had privately made an decision on whether he'd accept second place on the ticket if it were offered by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Privately, yes,'' he replied. Had he informed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? `` No,'' he said. `` That would be public.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with his state campaign chairmen for pre-convention planning and then flew to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s beauty contest primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended up with all of the territory's 57 delegates. `` No doubt there will be some adjustments made in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' he said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made what chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> claimed was history by settling all delegate challenges before the July convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. After the last four disputes, involving delegates in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, were settled, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said it was the first time the Democrats would open their convention without a single delegate challenge. But disputes over platform issues were far from over. One of those was highlighted Thursday when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he could support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for an independent Palestinian state. `` No, of course not,'' he said. `` I support direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors and responsible Palestinians who ... recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist within its borders,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to do everything I can as president to create an environment in which these discussions can take place.'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairmen from 13 Southern states met in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and were told by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> that the vice president would be emphasizing the differences between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall campaign. `` It's obvious to me the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has made a very conscious decision to try to make the case there's not a lot of difference between the candidates,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, a native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinian </LOCATION>. `` Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' unveiled the first of what it said would be a series of television commercials supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The commercial describes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s career as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, businessman, member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and as vice president. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group, said $ 330,000 was being spent to air the commercial on several cable networks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no public appearances, but he began the day with a breakfast with Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, who is often mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate. The former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador is a favorite of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conservatives who like her tough anti-communist positions on foreign policy.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday that it is too early for emergency relief measures to deal with effects of the drought, a White House spokesman reported. `` Despite the serious potential effects of the drought, the secretary said rainfall in the next two weeks would alleviate much of the potential damage,'' Deputy Press Secretary <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, said in a separate statement, `` If conditions continue to deteriorate, money that has been saved in this year's farm programs will be redirected to farm families as disaster relief for the rural economy.'' Rising crop prices are expected to reduce the direct subsidies that would have to be paid to farmers this year, saving an unspecified amount of federal money. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> also reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drought </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is establishing a toll-free telephone number to answer questions about federal services available to citizens in drought-stricken areas. The hotline begins operation Friday and will operated from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. EDT on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT on Saturdays. The number is 1-800-541-3375. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> briefed the president and vice president and then the Cabinet in separate meetings He said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a map that demonstrated the worsening condition of the drought in many areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The secretary said that in discussions he has had with congressmen and senators, farm groups and governors, there was agreement that it is too early for emergency relief measures,'' the White House spokesman said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> also reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies have taken some steps to help, such as allowing haying and grazing on conservation reserves. The spokesman quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying after the meeting, `` Our No. 1 worry right now is the effects of the drought on the farmers and their families and making certain they receive any help we can provide.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says High-Level Officials Let Off Lightly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Education Department is letting high-level officials get away with abuses for which low-level employees and program beneficiaries are punished harshly, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman said Thursday. `` High-ranking officials have gotten off with slaps on the wrist, while low-level employees and program participants have been disciplined or prosecuted to the full extent of the law,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said in opening a hearing on criminal cases investigated by the department's inspector general. `` Our preliminary review of these cases indicates that justice is not blind when it comes to corruption at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who chairs the Government Operations subcommittee on human resources. Much of the discussion centered on two-year-old charges against <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON>, assistant secretary for special education and the estranged wife of conservative columnist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON>. The inspector general, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said his office recommended that Mrs. Will be criminally charged based on findings that she had used a department car and driver for personal business, had claimed travel expenses that were never incurred, and had authorized payments to a special assistant in her office for four months after terminating the woman's employment. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney indicated the case would be prosecuted, but <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGenova </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney at the time, decided it should be treated as a civil matter. Mrs. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> and two others involved paid restitution totaling $ 15,000 to the department. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he wrote two letters asking why the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office had decided not to prosecute Some weeks later he received a reply citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent and an overall lack of merit. `` I was uncomfortable with it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said of <PERSON> DiGenova </PERSON>'s decision `` When we have sufficient evidence ... then I feel there should be a prosecution.'' Asked if the treatment of Mrs. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> was comparable to the treatment of others charged with similar offenses, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> replied, `` The record on that is very mixed.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, deputy undersecretary for management, denied that there was a double standard of justice at her department. `` Each case is taken individually,'' she said. `` A number of factors have to be considered,'' including whether a person is a career civil servant or a political appointee. Guidelines attached to <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s testimony said that by law, willful use or authorization of a government vehicle for other than official purposes must be punished by suspension of at least 30 days or removal. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said willful intent was never proved in the Will case. The guidelines say penalties for falsifying an attendance record for oneself or another employee should range from a five-day suspension to removal for a first offense. The same range was recommended for falsifying documents and actual or attempted theft of government property. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> contrasted <PERSON> Will </PERSON>'s case with several others, all recorded in bi-annual reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by the department's inspector general. Among them: _ A department employee pleaded guilty to filing false time records involving $ 2,000 She was required to make restitution, received an 18-month suspended jail sentence, and was placed on three years' probation. _ A <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> man received a suspended jail sentence and paid a $ 2,500 fine for understating his income so his wife could get a $ 5,000 student loan _ An employee was fired and another suspended without pay for 13 days for backdating civil rights reports when they could n't meet timetables set by the department _ A department pool driver was suspended for 60 days without pay for using his official vehicle on personal business Mrs. <PERSON> Will </PERSON>, in a June 22 letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said she did not know that her former aide was not at her work station while her salary was continuing. She said she had acknowledged responsibility by making full restitution, but `` never did I knowingly violate any government regulation.'' The letter, made available by the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, did not address the other allegations.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> recalled the evils of Nazism during a meeting Thursday with President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who has been accused of being involved in war crimes while serving in <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army. Foreign diplomats did not attend a speech by the pope to church and government officials including <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who has been virtually ostracized internationally because of his wartime past. But diplomats warmly greeted the pope at a reception afterwards. `` In this year of 1988, I should like to particularly recall the great trials and cruel tyranny which <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, along with other nations, had to suffer in the not too distant past,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in his speech, at the beginning of a five-day visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, his second since becoming pope in 1978. `` Amongst the many who were persecuted for religious, racial and political reasons were large numbers of Catholics _ priests, members of religious orders and lay people,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in an ornate ceremonial hall of the Hofburg Palace. About 80 people, including government officials and church leaders, attended the gathering. The pope delivered his address in German. This year is the 50th anniversary of the `` Anschluss,'' when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> annexed his native country in 1938. The event, coupled with a war record that continues to dog <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, has inspired controversy and soul-searching. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has repeatedly denied involvement in war crimes. In his own greeting, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> thanked the pontiff for receiving him at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in June 1987 _ a meeting that drew a bitter response from Jewish leaders because of questions about the president's war service. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said at the time that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was receiving the office, not the man. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> has said of the pope's trip to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>: `` This is not a political visit, it is a pastoral visit. He was invited by the bishops.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and his family later posed for pictures with the pontiff at the <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>. Then the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> for about five minutes, but <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> declined to say what the two men talked about. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> did not attend a reception afterwards where the envoys greeted the pope, according to a pool report distributed to journalists. The pope then retired for the night at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> archbishop's residence. Protests coincided with the pope's arrival. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said an evening Mass at St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s Cathedral. As he was about to start, American Jews displayed banners at the windows of a hotel across the square from the cathedral. The banners said `` Nazi Waldheim'' and `` Do n't Meet <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>.'' Police ordered the banners removed. Several hours before <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> arrived, Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and five other American Jews demonstrated outside <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s office. `` Do not embrace <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, no!'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> told a small crowd attracted to the demonstration. The other five members of the group were dressed in black-and-white striped uniforms similar to those of concentration camp inmates. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying: `` The pope's meeting with his flock in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is not what troubles the Jewish community. It is the deliberate inclusion of meetings with <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on his itinerary.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will make about 20 appearances in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, 85 percent of whose 7.5 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. He visited the country for three days in 1983. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, smiling and wearing a blue suit, was the first person to greet the white-robed pontiff as he stepped off the special <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> jetliner at <LOCATION> Schwechat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The pope mentioned several places he will visit, including <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp where 110,000 prisoners died. `` Let us, when we meet, bring before God not only the great and burdensome legacy of the past but also the joys and sorrows of the present,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, speaking in German. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> also denounced `` intolerance, intransigence and hate among nations, religions and classes,'' but made no direct reference to the dispute over his past. Most Western leaders shun <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general for 10 years, because of allegations of complicity in Nazi atrocities. The charges arose during the election campaign two years ago. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> denies wrongdoing but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has barred him from the country, saying it has evidence he was involved in deporting civilians while serving as a German army officer in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, on the 38th foreign pilgrimage of his papacy, also will meet with representatives of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s small Jewish community and address Roman Catholics from neighboring communist countries.

 Thirty rickety trucks and buses comprising the Veterans Peace Convoy circled the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to protest administration opposition to their mission of delivering the vehicles and tons of food, medicine and clothing to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The convoy arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where customs officials seized four vehicles and barred the group from crossing into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> without posting bond and signing an agreement that the aging school buses and pickup trucks would be returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have come to take care of the children of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said convoy organizer <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We intend to lobby and gain support for this convoy to pass. We want to feed the children, not the war.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, expressed support for the group with a resolution introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the treasury secretary should not regulate the donation of articles to relieve human suffering in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` It's wrong to thwart the humanitarian impulses of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. This tradition has sustained us and made us leaders throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said in a statement Thursday. `` How ironic it would be to deny assistance to our own neighbors in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. There are hungry and wounded children awaiting this aid. People of good will wish to help them. We must and we will find a resolution.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contends that to let the vehicles remain in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would violate a trade embargo. But <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration fears the vehicles would land in the military's hands are unfounded. Four of the convoy's original 38 vehicless did not survive the long trip from <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of mechicanical problems The rest, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said, are unworthy of military service because of the many miles they have on them _ or would have on them by the time they reached <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The buses, adorned with slogans in English and Spanish such as `` Help the children,'' `` On to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or bust'' and `` Bikes, not bombs,'' circled the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the cheers and whistles of about 100 protesters. Convoy spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrilees </PERSON> said the group, which is made up mostly of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, would continue its protest across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` as long as it takes.'' But the contingent may take the convoy to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> if <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, refuses their demand that he meet with them by Friday afternoon. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the convoy's request for a meeting was being considered late Thursday She initially said the convoy should instead contact the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for enforcing the trade embargo. The convoy formed after groups from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, and Caribou, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, joined in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, arriving in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> on June 7. The 30 tons of aid carried by the group includes oats and dry milk and medical supplies such as crutches and wheelchairs. Another 140 tons of humanitarian aid collected by the group was shipped to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, members of the convoy said. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is trying to stop a massive people-to-people humanitarian aid campaign,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said as an anti-nuclear group chanted and beat on drums nearby. Convoy leaders have filed a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> against the customs order.

<TEXT>
 A group calling itself `` Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' said Thursday it will spend $ 10 million in an effort to elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the next president, including a series of television commercials. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign says organizers of the effort have been asked to stop using <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name in their fundraising. `` We feel that this committee has misrepresented itself,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. `` They're misrepresenting that their group is an authorized campaign committee, and they're not.'' She said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was not opposed to independent efforts to help elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as long as those groups make it clear they are not part of the authorized campaign committee. The first commercial, shown at preview for reporters, highlights <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s career as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, businessman, member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and `` as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trusted vice president. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will make a great president, but first we have the tough job of getting him elected,'' retired Adm. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> says in the commercial which solicits contributions to pay for more advertising. The effort, which is independent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign and not subject to federal spending limits that apply to the campaign itself, is being underwritten by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> told reporters the committee `` supports the initiatives of the active-duty military'' and that the advertising effort would seek to portray <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate with the best record on supporting the military. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for the organization, said $ 330,000 was being spent to buy time for the first commercial on several cable networks, including <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, and on stations in regional markets. It will be shown starting next week, he said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fediay </PERSON>, chairman of Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the commercial `` is only the beginning of the very active role that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> hopes to have through the election, not only to have an impact in helping to elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but also on a number of senatorial races and some targeted congressional races.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of several contractors under scrutiny in a defense fraud investigation, received a $ 963.2 million contract Thursday for F-A-18 jet fighters. The contract, awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, calls for construction of 84 of the sophisticated jets _ the full number authorized for purchase in fiscal 1988 by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wants to buy another 72 of the twin-engine jets in fiscal 1989. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> is the prime contractor for the plane, which is nicknamed the Hornet. The <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another defense contractor under scrutiny, is a major subcontractor. Both <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> were named in search warrants executed last week by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents investigating what has been described as a massive fraud and bribery scheme. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has been identified as a client of <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary and now a defense consultant believed to be one target of the investigation. The F-A-18 is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest carrier-based fighter. It is capable of being used either as an air-to-air fighter or as an air-to-ground attack jet. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents made a point of searching <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> offices for documents involving potential sales of the plane to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies.

<HEAD>FDIC Chief Sees Texas Bailouts Cutting Fund by 10 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fund that insures deposits in commercial banks could decline by as much as 10 percent _ the first drop in its 54-year history _ after the completion of three large bank bailouts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> this year, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, in the text of a speech to be delivered Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, said the fund should start growing again in 1989 after <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are rescued. When <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> announced a $ 1 billion infusion into <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> in March, he noted the fund, which had $ 18.3 billion at the end of 1987, could decline this year for the first time since it was established in 1934. But the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> speech was the first time he said the loss to the fund, which expects revenue of more than $ 3 billion this year, would likely be limited to 10 percent. In 1987, the fund posted a small $ 50 million gain last year despite a post-Depression record of 184 bank failures. Failures are continuing at about the same pace this year and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is dealing with larger institutions. The agency hopes by mid-September to find a private investor to help in its rescue of First RepublicBank. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says preliminary estimates of the ultimate cost of the bailout range up to $ 2 billion, which would make it the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest ever, but it said the fund's initial outlay could be even greater. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said widespread weaknesses in the oil-drilling states of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> `` will continue to be a significant burden for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, at least for the short run, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> fund is sufficient to deal with the problems we can foresee at this time.''

<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra case complained Thursday about more delays in bringing <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to trial and called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to speed up the declassification of necessary documents if it wants the case to go forward. `` The highest levels of the government have to make a decision as to whether this case is going to go or if it's not going to go,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said during a hearing on the problems posed by reams of secret government documents collected by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The judge expressed frustration over <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request for a one-month delay in getting 150,000 pages of secret documents cleared by an interagency task force. `` If you ca n't get a trial going soon there is n't going to be a trial,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> warned both sides during the hearing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he was not ready to schedule a trial of the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, even though he had been preparing to set a date. `` I anticipated when I came on the bench of issuing a trial date notice tomorrow. I'm not going to do that. The case is n't ready,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> suggested that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> designate a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official to review the situation to help the administration decide whether it is ready to release secret documents or whether the case has to be dismissed. The judge questioned whether `` we wo n't need to have a clear decision from the administration itself that they want to try this case or they do n't want to.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he already has consulted with Deputy Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> about the secrecy problems and would meet with other senior <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Some 82,000 pages of classified documents, many from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> North </PERSON> worked until he was fired in November 1986, already have been turned over to the defense for pretrial review. Of that group, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said a `` much smaller number but still a large number'' of documents will be relevant to the case. The prosecutor repeated previous assertions that the batch of unprocessed 150,000 pages from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contained little that would be relevant to the defense case. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the task force, composed of representatives of agencies that originate the documents, needs more time to mark the portions of the documents that must be redacted before they can be introduced at trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he had deferred to the interagency task force out of concern for national security concerns about disclosing the documents in open court. But `` the obstacles keep arising,'' the judge said. Although he expressed confidence `` they are not trying to torpedo the case or help the case,'' the task force members `` are not in the position to judge the larger implications of the case,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. The judge said a high-level political decision is needed on what material the administration will allow to be disclosed in court. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had ordered North to specify by July 11 what secret government documents he intended to disclose in court to defend the charges against him. North, along with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, are accused of conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on such aid. The judge has ordered four separate trials. North was designated as the leadoff defendant by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The issue involves classified documents that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and, ultimately, his three co-defendants would be allowed to introduce into evidence to rebut the charges. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, a defendant must notify the government of secret documents he wants to disclose in court. The judge then decides whether the documents are indeed relevant to the case. Under the law, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> can order the substitution of secret documents that government does n't want released with statements of facts the material would prove if presented to the jury. He can also dismiss the charges if there are too many secret documents that the government wants withheld from the case. An alternative to dismissing all the charges would be to force North to stand trial on some of the counts contained in the indictment that would n't require extensive use of classified documents. These might include charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his role in the covert effort to help the Nicaraguan rebels and allegations he obstructed a presidential inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair by destroying documents. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request to delay production of the remaining documents and a defense complaint about the slow pace of pre-trial discovery prompted <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to convene the hearing. Among other things, the defense complained that it has yet to receive any of the government documents that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigators were allowed to look at but could not copy. These include relevant pages of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s diary and schedule.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Federally Funded Abortions for Rape, Incest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to give victims of rape or incest the right to federally funded abortions. The panel voted 15-14 to defeat a motion to delete the provision, which had been added earlier this week by a subcommittee to the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the departments of health and human services, labor and education. The Office of Management and Budget, in a letter to committee members, said presidential advisers would recommend a veto of the $ 139 billion bill if it includes the abortion provision. The sponsor of the motion, Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., argued before the committee that `` denying Medicaid funds to poor women for what is legal in this country makes no sense. The annual spending bill usually contains a provision saying abortions can only be paid for under the federal-state Medicaid program when the woman's life would be endangered by carrying the fetus to term. The version approved by the committee would return the law to its status before 1980. The same provision was added in 1986 in committee, but removed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The 1989 spending bill is expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor next month. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> called the new abortion provision a Medicaid expansion that `` diverges from longstanding policy on this issue.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> letter `` a waste of power'' that diverts attention from the needs of the nation into `` narrow philosophical issues.''

Within minutes of the orders issued Thursday, spokesman <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said, `` There is no doubt whatsoever that there will be retaliation'' by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The most serious rift in <LOCATION> Canadian-Soviet </LOCATION> relations in a decade began Tuesday when Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s government said eight Soviet diplomats and officials had been expelled and nine others formerly posted in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would not be allowed to return. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> retaliated Wednesday by expelling two Canadian diplomats and barring re-entry for three others, alleging espionage. A statement Thursday from Canadian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the espionage allegations against the Canadian diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are `` totally without justification.'' It said the latest expulsions follow `` Soviet espionage activities in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> which have obliged the Canadian government to expel the Soviet officials.'' The statement gave no details of the alleged spying by <PERSON> Roublev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kashtanov </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s press secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they were involved in `` unacceptable activities,'' the usual euphemism for spying. <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roublev </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since May 1985, while <PERSON> Kashtanov </PERSON> served in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from February 1981 to August 1985. Asked why they had not been expelled earlier, <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said: `` We think our response is appropriate in the circumstances.'' He said the Soviet ambassador was called in Thursday and informed of the latest action. He was also told that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was willing to `` put the matter behind us'' if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did likewise, <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said. The last wave of mass expulsions was in 1978 when 13 Soviet diplomats were expelled for trying to recruit a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer as a double agent. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy ring tried to infiltrate a U.S.-owned military contractor in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, which has access to highly classified American naval technology. <ORGANIZATION> Paramax </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Detroit-based <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is building the combat systems for six new Canadian frigates and the radar, sonar and communications systems for six other frigates. A Soviet translator at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Smurov </PERSON>, provided `` useful information'' leading to the breakup of the spy ring, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Smurov </PERSON> has now defected and asked for asylum for himself, his wife and daughter <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>, a fifth grade pupil.

<HEAD>Future Heat Waves And Droughts Expectable More Often, Scientist

<TEXT>
 The `` greenhouse effect'' global warming of the earth is here, but the current drought and heat wave over much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ca n't be blamed on it, a scientist told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday. However, similar heat waves and droughts can be expected much more often as a result of future warming, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a climatologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> there is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong in blaming rising temperatures around the world on the buildup of manmade gases in the atmosphere. For unknown reasons, the earth has been getting warmer for more than a century, though with cooler intervals. The four warmest years on record have been recorded in the 1980s _ and without what <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> called an improbable cooling for the rest of the year, 1988 will break all records. Though there has been much speculation by scientists around the world that the warming resulted from the greenhouse effect, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s statement is the most definite yet. <PERSON> Syukuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Manabe </PERSON>, soil specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fluid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said it was more likely that the current drought was the result of natural fluctuations than the greenhouse warming. `` It is an example of the kind of drought that will occur more frequently as the global warming become larger,'' he said. Many studies have said global warming could bring drastic changes in weather, including more rainfall at low and high latitudes and more drought in between, with drastic shifts in possible crop patterns. A major report from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oganization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month concluded that without a major effort to fight warming, global temperatures could increase by 0.54 degrees Fahrenheit per decade until the middle of the next century, and sea levels could rise by a foot. Tropical temperatures would n't change much at all, but in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> the change could be two or three times as large as the average. Extreme temperatures would occur more often. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> earlier calculated that instead of the typical one day a year with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ it reached 101 on Wednesday _ the year 2030 could see 12 days. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> would see 78 such days instead of 19. Gases emitted by modern civilization _ notably carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels but also methane, nitrous oxide and the chlorofluorcarbon gases that major nations agreed last year to reduce _ trap heat from the earth's surface that normally would be radiated out to space just as the glass over a greenhouse traps the sun's heat inside. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are 10 percent above 1958 levels and 25 percent above concentrations believed to prevail in 1790, when the industrial revolution brought the first widespread burning of coal in industry to fire the new steam engines. `` If we could magically reduce -LRB- annual -RRB- emissions -LRB- of carbon -RRB- by about 3 billion tons, we could stabilize the content of the atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` It is well within reach, no question about that.'' `` The problem ... has the potential for turning the world into a form of chaos not greatly different from that produced by global war,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., concerned about his state's coal industry, asked physical chemist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based policy research organization, if technology could not reduce the harmful emissions `` I'm trying to find a way to use a resource we have,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> replied, `` I would argue the resource we have in most abundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficiently at much lower cost than building any form of power generation.''

 The late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s once-might image fell a little farther Thursday. A white marble mansion built for brief visit he paid to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> will be turned into a wedding palace. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s Communist party built the mansion, which overlooks the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, for the Soviet leader so he would have an appropriate place to stay during a visit to the southern republic's capital in 1982 He stayed only two days and the building has been unoccupied since, according to reports by state television and the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` This beautiful white marble building is well known to all <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> residents, but hardly any one of them can boast of being in it even once,'' a television correspondent said on Vremya, the evening news program. He said the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> acted under the principle of `` social fairness'' in deciding to convert the mansion. `` Soon, <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>'s march will ring out here for thousands of newlyweds,'' the correspondent said as images of crystal chandeliers flashed across the screen in shots of the mansion's interior In January, Soviet authorities stripped a city, town squares and a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name. The two-story mansion, surrounded by a high concrete wall, was built in the days when <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, a close <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> associate, was party chief in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> was retired from the ruling Politburo at the age of 64 on Oct. 21, 1987, ostensibly for health reasons but under a cloud of poor performances of industries he was responsible for. The man who replaced <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> party chief, <PERSON> Kyamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON>, was fired May 21, apparently for mishandling a territorial and ethnic dispute with the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON>'s leadership also received an implied blow on Thursday. The television report said a complex of buildings where Azerbaijani leaders had lived will be turned into a children's health center. The report did not specifically mention <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON>. The appropriation of lavish private mansions has a long tradition here. When the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> seized power in 1917, they converted many mansions of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s aristocrats and palaces of the Czars for public use. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name has become synonymous with what Soviet officials call the `` period of stagnation,'' a time when the economy fell into a slump. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who ruled from 1964 until his death in 1982, has been blamed for fostering complacency and cronyism.

A <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> charge of being a fugitive from justice was dismissed. <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> was wanted in connection with the slaying of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Capuano </PERSON>, 34, whose bullet-ridden body was found in a bed and breakfast inn on May 31. A medical examiner said he had been dead for at least 48 hours.

 Applicants for civil service jobs no longer will have to take written examinations under a new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy that will rely solely on college grades or job-related skills tests when hiring new workers. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said in a speech Thursday to a group of recruiters that the shift will allow the government `` to pursue high-quality candidates aggressively'' because they will be able to offer jobs on the spot. The new policy will allow recruiters to hire any college graduate with a minumum grade point average of somewhere between 3.0 and 3.25 on a 4.0 scale. Others could be hired after passing an Individual Achievement Record skills test related to whatever job is being sought. These tests, said the government agency, will measure `` the full range of relevant personal qualities required for successful job performance.'' `` We want the strongest possible civil service and we're going to get it under this plan'' Ms. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said. She said the government needs to change its criteria for hiring to compete with private industry in attracting job applicants. `` The pool of young workers entering the job market will shrink -LRB- to -RRB- ... the lowest since the 1930s'' during the next decade. `` For the federal government this means that competition to hire and retain qualified candidates will be fiercer than ever,'' she told a recruiting conference. She said current testing procedures are `` so slow and cumbersome'' that many of the best candidates for jobs go elsewhere. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said she hoped the details of the plan could be worked out so the government could begin using the new hiring system by next April. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said in a speech to a conference attended by government recruiters that the new approach to selecting entry-level workers will allow the government access `` to the most intellectually strong, academically accomplished candidates'' and still `` ensure a workplace reflective of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> racial and ethnic diversity.'' But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, expressed concern about the change. `` Hiring on the basis of GPAs -LRB- grade point average -RRB- is contrary to congressional intent that hiring be done through a competitive exam that is nationwide in scope,'' he said. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>'s proposal also was criticized by her OPM predecessor, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, as `` a sad day for the civil service when it ca n't have an objective civil service exam. The government has had no entrance test for more than 100 jobs since 1982 when the Professional and <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Career </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examination </ORGANIZATION> was discarded after it was deemed to be racially discriminatory. Since then, hiring has been done using a temporary special process of interviews, recommendations and college grades that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> ruled last year was `` arbitrary and capricious.''

<HEAD>Millions Of Duplicate Records Found That Could Reopen Disability
Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The Veterans Administration announced Thursday the discovery of 10 million military medical records that duplicate some lost in a devastating 1973 fire, and said it will review disability claims that were rejected because of the lost files. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said the agency just became aware of the records last week and it was too early to tell how many people would be affected. But he called the development `` very important.'' `` It opens up new vistas for us. It means that these people who before had difficulty establishing a basis for their disability compensation, or the degree of it, ... it means we can have another chance to look at it and, in effect, may come up with a different result,'' <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, whose office helps veterans with their disability claims, said the development potentially could affect thousands of former military personnel. `` We've handled many cases where there were no records because of the fire and it's very difficult to develop additional evidence on which to try to get these claims allowed,'' he said in an interview. `` You'd be amazed at the number of people, World War II veterans in particular, who waited until they retired to file a claim with the VA, and then found the records had been destroyed,'' <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> said. `` Many of them felt they just did n't want to take anything from the government ... Then, as they aged, they decided to file a claim and discovered their records had been burned.'' Eighteen million military personnel records were destroyed or seriously damaged in the July 12, 1973 fire at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The lost records were from the years 1912 through 1959 for <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> personnel, and 1947 through 1963 for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel with the surnames of <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> and through the letter Z. The duplicate records cover the years 1942 to 1945 and 1950 to 1954, so will primarily affect veterans of World War II and the Korean War. The records were collected by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private research organization, during the 1950s as part of its analysis of Army hospital records. A researcher at the council came across the records and notified the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>, an archives spokeswoman. Ms. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said the records are on computer magnetic tapes created by the council from admissions punch cards prepared by the office of the surgeon general. She said the archives paid the council $ 8,662 for the tapes and will reformat them for cross-referencing against other files. The records were not listed by the military officer's name, but included the officer's serial number, grade and rank, age, date and place of admission as well as disease and diagnosis, Ms. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said. Veterans applying for monthly disability benefits as a result of injury or illness suffered while on active duty must have some verification of their claim. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said he did not have figures on how many disability claims had been denied as a result of the lost records. There were 3.5 million files that turned up for the year 1944 alone, <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said, covering about 2.4 million people. For 1945, 2 million files were discovered, covering about 1.4 million people. But officials cautioned against the notion that millions of veterans would be affected by the discovery. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief benefits director, said that most of the veterans who made disability claims did so during their initial years after service and likely would have filed claims before 1973 Those most likely to be affected by the discovery of the records include people with an injury suffered during active duty which was aggravated over the years, such as a back or heart ailment, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it would immediately begin reviewing disability claims rejected because of the lost records. The agency said it also expected many veterans would come forward seeking information about their claims. It said those people should contact their VA regional offices.

 Residents of this small mining town dread the end of a truce that gave them nearly three months of relative peace from fighting between U.S.-backed rebels and leftist Sandinista government troops. Both sides have sympathizers here, but everyone `` fears the return of the fighters,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>, owner of a small food shop. <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> nestles between two hills in the central Chontales province, a region which has seen intense fighting during the 6 -LCB- - year-old war between the rebels, known as Contras, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> Military sources say the violence has steadily diminished since a cease-fire began March 23. The town's only ambulance, once busy transporting war wounded, now ferries sick children to the local health center. Residents like <PERSON> Eudoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, 43, are now left more or less in peace. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> explained how he's gotten by in a war that has killed 26,500 people, wounded another 25,000 and nearly destroyed the Nicaraguan economy. `` The Contras come along and demand a cow. I give it to them,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. `` The Sandinistas come by, I give them one too. I'm happy they are leaving me in peace now to work. Military sources admit there have been some abuses by Sandinista soldiers, abuses that have helped the Contras build a strong base of popular support in the region. The fatigue-clad soldiers are still here, but now they doze on the shaded sidewalks instead of preparing for another round of combat. This region is also headquarters for a Contra force of about 2,000 rebels. Military sources who asked not to be identified said the army has been in contact with various rebel factions during the cease-fire, attempting to persuade them to lay down their arms. The army has had little success, the sources said. The truce is due to expire at the end of June. The last round of talks between the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> fell apart in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on June 9 and no new talks have been scheduled. The government has proposed another round in the capital starting June 26, but the rebels have not responded to the offer. Meanwhile, the people of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> wait, dreading renewed hostilities. `` We want to live in peace,'' said <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garay </PERSON>, a 53-year-old food vendor who lost a son and three grandchildren, all Sandinista soldiers, in the war. `` We want to forget our hatred and have a new life,'' <PERSON> Garay </PERSON> said. Pointing to the bullet-shattered windows of the church, he said: `` The war leaves only this.''

<HEAD>Navy Announces Schedule for Retiring 16 Frigates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has set up a schedule for retiring 16 aging frigates in a budget-cutting move that prompted the last secretary of the service to resign. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had decided to remove from active service 10 of the frigates by the end of this calendar year and the remaining six in 1989. The first eight of the 16 ships being retired prematurely will be decommissioned during the month of September, the Pentagon said. The last of the 16 will be retired in September 1989. `` The final disposition of each ship has not been determined,'' the statement added. `` Crewmembers will be reassigned to other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commands based on manning priorities. Every consideration will be given to satisfy individual duty preferences and minimize family and command difficulties.'' The 16 ships are operated by more than 5,100 sailors. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced early this year in unveiling the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1989 budget proposal the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would retire 16 older frigates and postpone indefinitely its goal of building a 600-ship fleet. The defense chief said the move was just one of several designed to shrink <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces rather than maintain a `` hollow'' force that was n't ready to fight. That decision was roundly _ and publicly _ criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who asserted <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and his aides had ignored realistic budget alternatives he advanced. Saying he could not work for <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> under the circumstances, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> abruptly resigned in February. Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to begin the decommissioning of the Brooke-class and Garcia-class frigates in September `` due to fiscal restraints.'' The Pentagon also acknowledged, however, that four of the 16 ships slated for retirement were now in the midst of overhauls. In each case, the overhauls will be completed before the ship is retired. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the four overhauls were costing a total of $ 78.5 million and were under way before the decision was made to retire the ships.

 The rain came _ not much, but it came _ 40 minutes ahead of schedule after a Sioux Indian medicine man gave prayers and offerings for rain in a traditional ceremony. Florist <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Doebel </PERSON> said he brought <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON> here from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, at a cost of $ 2,000, last weekend to make people aware of the drought and warn them that they may not be able to rely on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s agriculture this year. After performing his ceremony, <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON> said the rain should arrive Thursday. It began falling at 11:20 p.m. Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does not have an official rainfall monitor in <LOCATION> Clyde </LOCATION>, but precipitation in nearby northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> communities late Wednesday and early Thursday ranged from 0.22 inch in Fremont to 0.08 inch in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, forecaster <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroutka </PERSON> said. `` It's not enough, and the situation is still here and still severe,'' said <PERSON> Doebel </PERSON>. `` But I think it was enough to help some of the corn out.'' `` I'm not one to know those answers -LRB- of why it rained -RRB-,'' he said. `` All I know is you flip a coin and sometimes it comes up heads.'' Crow Dog, 45, arrived by plane Saturday and spent the night in a tepee erected in a field near the Doebel greenhouse. He performed a traditional ceremony, using prayers and offerings to summon the `` four winds of the earth'' to bring rain. Crow Dog left <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> early in the week, saying his work was done, <PERSON> Doebel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>FCC Will Consider Measures to Curb Abuses in License Renewal
Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> agreed Thursday to consider measures designed to curb abuses in a broadcast license renewal process that allows `` extortion and sham applications'' by license challengers seeking profitable settlements. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners voted 3-0 to consider changes in the system by which radio and television station owners renew their licenses and defend themselves against charges by competing companies that apply for the license to run the station. The license-challenge process is aimed at bringing to the commission legitimate issues related to a station owner's qualifications But commissioners said they were concerned that some license challengers may have no interest in running a broadcast station and may file competing applications or petition the agency to deny an incumbent's license only so they can profit from a financial settlement. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the commission will `` not ... tolerate extortion or sham applications.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider whether to limit the amount of money an incumbent licensee could pay a challenger to withdraw a competing application or to prohibit such payments altogether. The agency also will consider requiring competing applicants to identify financial contributions from those backing the application. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also will consider changes in its policy of granting stations `` renewal expectancy'' to give the industry more stability. Such status is currently awarded based on a station's past service to its community <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he wanted to develop a policy with the least amount of second-guessing of a station's programming decisions.

Thunderstorms were also scattered along a Canadian cold front that was sagging south across the northern <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region. Showers and thunderstorms, accompanied by gusty winds and heavy rain, were widespread along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. There were also isolated storms across the deserts of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53 degrees at <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, to 109 at <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A twin-engine plane that skidded to a stop on its nose in an abandoned airfield Thursday was carrying half a ton of cocaine, the largest shipment ever seized on the island, police said. Six people were in custody for questioning and helicopters were still combing the area late Thursday for another who escaped, police spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> said. No charges have been filed. Police said the cocaine shipment was the largest ever intercepted on its way to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. They estimated its street value at $ 720 million. `` Direct to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, this is the largest to date,'' <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> said. Last August more than 2,000 pounds of cocaine were found in the steel beams of more than 20 shipping containers bound for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The plane arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION>, 80 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, around 2 a.m. and scraped to a stop on its nose as it tried to land on a runway formerly operated by the government, police said. Occupants of a pickup truck waiting nearby raced over, unloaded seven dufflebags with about 400 pounds of the drug and took off in a hail of gunfire when federal and local drug agents arrived at the scene. After a chase though the darkness the truck fell into a ditch and its occupants escaped, police said. About 675 pounds of cocaine was found in the plane, wrapped in individual packages of about 2 pounds each, police said. They described the plane as an `` expensive'' Fairchild with a six - or seven-seat capacity Five men and a woman were later picked up nearby. At least four of them were believed to be local residents, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> said. Several weapons, including an Uzi machine gun with loaded magazines, a Magnum 357 pistol with extra shells and an AR-15 rifle were also seized, along with several portable radios. Officials said they did not know where the plane came from, but that most aircraft intercepted in the area with drugs aboard come from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> will go back on the air next Tuesday, with or without his writers but with their blessing in any event, head writer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said the writers were hoping that the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> would grant a waiver for the `` Late Night'' show to resume next week with its writers, but were still awaiting word. `` That means we will be by his side, but if not, he'll go back on the air just the same, no hard feelings,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` We've been having meetings all week and we've decided the best thing is to get the show on the air.'' As of Thursday night, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would not confirm that <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> was going back on the air. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> went back on the air last month without his writers. He is writing his own monologues. `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'' and `` Late Night'' went into reruns when the writers went on strike four months ago. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, a member of the guild, would not be violating the strike by going on the air in his capacity as a performer. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said if the writers do not get a waiver and <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> is on his own, he will make `` casual remarks'' at the beginning of the show, then interview guests. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> attended Wednesday night's meeting of the Writers Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where a vote was taken on the latest contract offer by the producers.

<HEAD>Police Surround Students at Buddhist Shrine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police formed a tight ring Thursday around the gold-encrusted <ORGANIZATION> Shwedagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pagoda </ORGANIZATION>, this Buddhist nation's holiest shrine, where student protesters set up a `` strike center.'' Students in green sarongs, the uniform of high school students, tried unsuccessfully to enlist residents of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in a march to the hilltop pagoda. The march did not take place. Demostrations also were reported in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north on the <LOCATION> Rangoon-Mandalay </LOCATION> railroad. Classes were suspended at the main schools in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the nation's second-largest city, but no disturbances were reported. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> spent its third night under a 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew and a ban on public meetings, which were imposed after street violence in which nine people were killed by official count. University students have led three major rounds of protest since October, the first since 1974 against the 26-year-old regime of Gen. Ne Win, whose economic policies and wars on ethnic minorities have impoverished this Southeast Asian country. Hundreds of people have been arrested and Western diplomats say 100 may have died in street violence, most in rioting March 18 and since. Witnesses said police closed the pagoda to the public at 5 a.m. and surrounded the grounds, on which protesters established their `` strike center'' Wednesday. Students began arriving at the shrine Wednesday morning after authorities shut down the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the last worshipers to leave said about 500 students were there, but the figure could not be confirmed. No information was available on the student demands or what was happening inside. Shwedagon Pagoda sits on a hill in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs. Its gilded central stupa, or tower, soars 325 feet above a temple base adorned with more than five tons of gold. Burmese are almost fanatically devoted to the shrine, which legend says was founded 2,500 years ago. It has survived wars, earthquakes and the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> occupation, during which it was a center for anti-colonial nationalists. Residents reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, about 380 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, said classes were suspended at <ORGANIZATION> Mandalay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The action appeared to be precautionary, since no trouble was reported. Similar reports from <PERSON> Pegu </PERSON> said an overnight curfew was imposed Wednesday after students and other rioters destroyed or heavily damaged government buildings, vehicles and cooperative stores. Pegu was the seat of several ancient kingdoms. Western analysts say restrictions on individual freedoms and poor economic conditions are spurring the protest. Although <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is rich in resources and has an educated populace, its per capita annual income of less than $ 200 puts it among the poorest nations. Ne Win's `` Burmese Way to Socialism'' mixes military control, socialism and few dealings with the outside world. Most merchants in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s sprawling market districts closed their shops at noon Thursday for fear of looting if violence resumed. Some government employees went home before normal closing hours. Attendance was minimal at high schools and the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the only center of higher learning still open in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Teachers were told to continue classes regardless of the attendance level. No major incidents have been reported since the curfew took effect Tuesday. A few street vendors and drivers of taxis and rickshaws have been arrested for going out before 6 a.m., but were reported freed after warnings. The latest trouble began Tuesday when 5,000 students and other protesters in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> fought police with stones. Students at several institutions demonstrated peacefully last week for legalization of student unions and release of detained comradesd. The government closed the school and the government responded with violence. Trouble began last October when the government declared much of the currency in circulation to be invalid and did not offer compensation. On March 18, after several days of unrest, police and soldiers quickly crushed a rampage in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> by students and other protesters. A government panel announced only two deaths and said 625 people were arrested, but diplomatic sources told reporters in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, as many as 100 people have been killed since October. Many of those arrested have been released.

 A federal agency is investigating an arson fire at a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> warehouse owned by the same company whose <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plant was ravaged by fire over the weekend, routing 25,000 people from their homes. While the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> was looking into the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> warehouse fire Thursday, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> investigators were on their way to <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> to take a look at the burned-out plant, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> fire department spokesman <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Placanico </PERSON> said. `` We'll probably go down there, too,'' <PERSON> Placanico </PERSON> said. Firefighters in protective suits continued carting barrels of chloride out of the remains of the 18th-century mill Thursday as ambulances stood by in case pockets of fumes overwhelmed the workers. The <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> plant burned for four days, spewing a three-mile-long gas cloud across the city of 170,000 and forced thousands out of the neighborhood before firefighters controlled the last of several fires Monday. The first fire apparently was sparked by rainwater that fell through a window of the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant and mixed with chloride tablets that the plant makes for swimming pools, causing a violent reaction. The later fires are under investigation. A June 10 fire at a <ORGANIZATION> Weatherking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse in <LOCATION> Doraville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, owned by the same company, also appears to be accidental, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public safety department. But the second fire Tuesday in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was clearly the work of an arsonist, he said. `` There was no other way that fire could have started,'' he said in a telephone interview. The arson fire destroyed the 30,000-foot swimming pool supply warehouse, which also housed offices, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` The unusual number of fires here and up there have forced us to make the connection,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the Union-News of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` We think they are associated and so we've called in the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> to help us.'' An agent with the bureau said investigators are working only on the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> fires and have not been called in to help with the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> investigation, which is being handled by the city arson squad. But he added that the federal investigators are keeping watch on what the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> fire officials turn up. `` Nobody can say yet whether these fires were arson or accidental,'' said agent <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> McArdle </PERSON>. `` But we are keeping an eye on it. When two company plants have chemical fires, we are interested.'' No one was hurt in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> fires, which released a small amount of chlorine gas but forced no evacuations. An estimated 275 people have gone to Springfield-area hospitals for treatment since the first fire ignited Friday, but none of the injuries has been reported to be serious. Advanced Laboratories and Weatherking South are both wholly owned subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Aquafab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a pool supply firm owned by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perreira </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coventry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, according to records filed with secretaries of state in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> has released records showing that since April 1986, state officials have investigated a series of incidents at the plant, including charges that the firm was illegally dumping chlorine chemicals in a nearby pond. An attorney for the company has said the owners will have no comment until the damage from the fire has been assessed.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Thursday federal programs will provide relief for drought-stricken farmers, but governors meeting in emergency session questioned whether those methods were adequate. During a brief appearance before the 10 governors who gathered for the day-long conference, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> promised the federal government `` will do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage.'' But the agriculture secretary also reminded the gathering that there were several existing aid programs already in place, and he stressed repeatedly that the extent of the damage from the drought was yet to be determined. But Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, speaking at a closing news conference, said farmers in several states already had lost much of their cash crops and others have sold off entire livestock herds for lack of feed grain. `` Where I think he -LRB- <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> -RRB- is wrong is in the wheat area,'' said Sinner. `` That damage is done and it is very, very severe. In the livestock feed area, that damage is done and it's going to grow.'' Sinner also said government programs must be made flexible enough to ensure that farmers hurt by the current drought are n't disqualified from participating in crop-insurance and disaster-loan program because of `` technicalities. `` I'm afraid we're going to lose some farmers,'' he said, `` and we've lost enough already in my state.'' That message echoed throughout the day. `` Welcome to the heart of the droughtland,'' Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said in opening the conference. `` We used to be known as the heart of the heartland. Now we are both.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> noted that 1,200 counties in 30 states already have been granted permission for grazing livestock or making hay on government-rented land normally set aside for conservation or crop-reduction plans. He also pointed out that task forces already have been set up within the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to study the consequences of the drought. The federal government's crop-insurance and disaster-loan programs could serve large number of farmers once the extent of the damage from the drought becomes clear, he said. `` The situation is still fluid. ... We'll need a little bit of time to learn what the losses are,'' he said. Before he left the conference, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said he would meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday morning to update him on the drought situation. But several governors suggested the situation in their states already demands a more-specific response from the federal goverment _ even if they had different ideas on what the response should be. Illinois' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the barge traffic along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> so crucial to agricultural states like <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was paralyzed because of low water levels, and proposed he <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> seek permission to divert water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to solve the problem. That proposal, however, was disputed by <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` It might turn out to be more disastrous over the long term than the immediate salvation it provides,'' said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> governor. `` It's an idea we should explore. I'm just saying we should not go quickly, though.'' <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said restoring last year's 50-cent price cut on federal dairy support programs and blocking a second cut next January `` would do more for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> farmers than anything but rain.'' Given the differing needs of the states represented, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was asked how they would reach agreement on priorities. `` That's difficult,'' he said, `` any time you deal with agricultural issues, everybody has a different agenda. ... But this issue is crucial enough for us to find a common ground.'' Attending the day-long meeting, besides <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> and both <PERSON> Thompsons </PERSON>, were the governors of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebaska </LOCATION>.

 Some watermelons no longer rate as seedy characters. Two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Petoseed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, are marketing seedless watermelons, which are showing up in supermarkets across the nation for the first time. Sun World has launched a national marketing effort for its seedless watermelons, while Petoseed has provided several growers with seeds and is promoting hybrid seedless varieties the company developed.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> left Thursday for a week-long visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during which he said he would present <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials with plans for the future of the Israeli-occupied lands. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he would meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials but described his trip as a `` regular visit.'' Israeli officials did not disclose <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s itinerary for security reasons. `` I will take an opportunity before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elections to thank a sympathetic, supportive administration, and particularly President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who has done so much for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said before departing from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> airport. The defense minister said he planned to discuss with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> situation and the Arab uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which has claimed the lives of 211 Palestinians and four Israelis since it began last Dec. 8. `` I'm bringing them some plans for the future,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said without elaborating. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s visit comes amidst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of Israeli policies in the occupied territories. The latest criticism came Thursday, when <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of violating Palestinian human rights. Speaking at <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop deportations, administrative detentions, house demolitions and other measures of what he termed collective punishment. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 21 Palestinians since the uprising began. As of June 9, at least 2,500 Palestinians have been served with administrative detention orders, a measure allowing the army to hold a suspect in jail for a period of up to six months without trial. In apparent response to <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>'s criticism, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> revealed plans to release some Palestinian detainees. He said between 50 and 80 prisoners are beingh released every day. `` If a village or a family have shown good behavior, we are going to release some detainees from the area,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. `` We want to use the carrot as well, not only the stick.''

 Some watermelons no longer rate as seedy characters. Two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Petoseed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, are marketing seedless watermelons, which are showing up in supermarkets across the nation for the first time.

 A federal judge threw out a $ 24 million damage suit Thursday against former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders and cocaine traffickers accused of running an arms-for-drugs smuggling scheme. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> dismissed the case against Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> deputy director of operations <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, former Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> and 25 other defendants, including leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>. The suit was filed two years ago by the liberal, Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of journalist <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>, injured in the 1984 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> bombing aimed at maverick Contra leader <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>. King said the plaintiffs failed to prove their basic contention that a wide-ranging conspiracy was responsible for the La Penca bombing that injured <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and later threats aimed at covering up their involvement. The trial had been scheduled to start Monday. `` That's fantastic,'' said <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when told of the dismissal. `` It's what I have been saying all along: There is no basis to the damn thing.'' <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>'s sentiments were echoed by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> and one of the most active defense lawyers in the case. `` We're elated,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. `` Now it's payback time. We're going to file some actions for malicous prosecution and defamation'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and their attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a terse response to the judge's decision. `` We're going to appeal immediately,'' said Director <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. Their spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykstra </PERSON>, said he felt the decision was an effort to delay the case until after the November elections. Although only 13 of the defendants had filed motions for summary judgment, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the case was not strong enough for trial against the remainder. `` The plaintiffs have made no showing of existence of genuine issues of material fact with respect to either the bombing at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penca </LOCATION>, the threats made to their news sources, or threats made to themselves,'' wrote King. The damage and racketeering suit charged that the defendants were members of a right-wing terror network dating to 1959 and illegally participated in assassination plots, gun running and drug trafficking. Other well-known defendants included <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>; reputed <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, Costa Rican rancher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> and former mercenary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the Iran-Contra affair became public, and many of the names it brought to light have been indicted or appeared before congressional committees investigating that case. The suit accused the defendants of funding illegal Contra activities with drug runs in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, and threatening, imprisoning and even killing anyone who threatened to uncover the ring. Affidavits filed with the suit say the Contra involvement was simply the latest venture of what <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> called an `` off-the-shelf, stand-alone, self-financing'' operation dating to the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and the Vietnam War. According to the suit, <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> and others, using drug profits, assassinated officials in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other nations. By keeping the operation off the books, they could violate federal laws and avoid congressional oversight. When the reform administration of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was elected in 1976, <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> took the operation completely private to avoid scrutiny, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> says. The key event in the suit was the May 1984 bombing of a news conference held by <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>. Three journalists and five <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> supporters died in the explosion, although <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> was only slightly injured. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> was seriously hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion, allowing him and his wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, to file a civil damage suit under federal law. According to the suit, that bombing was arranged by <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders and others angered that <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> refused to join anti-Sandinista groups he considered too close to deposed Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON>. All the major figures in the suit have strenuously denied the charges. In a May 6 hearing, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> accused members of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of trying to block the suit because of potential damage to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, when, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> and others in the agency went private with the `` secret team.'' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON>, head of the Washington-based conservative foundation, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was initially named in the suit but was dropped after a few months. He denied involvement in any weapons or drug allegations, saying his foundation emphasizes only humanitarian aid for Central America. `` Acts of legal terorism like this against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice system should not be tolerated,'' he said. `` They obviously could n't even get close to making their case because it was dropped with prejudice.'' He said the suit was a polticially motivated suit and named `` innocent people with nefarious people to besmirch the names of the innocent people. ... They threw in a lot of nefarious characters to give it credence.''

 Tall pine trees will shield many sensitive operations of an east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> army installation from Soviet observers arriving in mid-August to watch the burning of medium-range nuclear missiles, officials said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the contractor operating the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, won a $ 1.1 million contract that will allow it to burn 74 of about 800 rocket motors being eliminated under a joint U.S.-Soviet treaty The plant, about 170 miles east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, is one of two sites the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> selected to burn the <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> missiles banned under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Under the pact, a team of up to 20 Soviet observers will watch the burning _ and little else. `` On-site inspection does not mean that the Soviets will get a free look at our secrets,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, plant commander. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> officials said they have received the blessing of state and environmental officials to burn the missile motors through static firings and by open-air ignition. Soviet observers, mandated by the treaty to watch the burnings, will arrive at the <LOCATION> Gregg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, stay at area motels and dine in local restaurants but will have little to do with residents, company officials said. `` We plan no special events or contacts with the community for the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> said. `` Our contacts will be professional _ a charge we take seriously. We have a detailed security plan.'' The two superpowers must, under the terms of the treaty signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, reduce their medium-range nuclear missiles within three years. The other Army-authorized burning site, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, has raised the ire of some environmentalists. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials have no previous experience with rocket motor testing and want the military to answer questions about the project. The Army conducted a static missile firing in late May for <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials `` to establish whether we can meet their requirements'' he said. Data from that firing will be analyzed and released next month, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, adding he was confident the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s application for missile burning at the <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> would be approved. Missiles to be burned in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would be hauled by rail or truck from several locations, primarily <PERSON> Pueblo </PERSON>, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thiokol </LOCATION> plant engineering manager for the Longhorn Divison. At the Longhorn plant, reporters were taken by bus down tree-lined roads to a signal testing area, where missile motors will be fired, then to a circular field where solid rocket propellant will be burned in open-air cages. `` This is the exact route the Soviet vistors will be taking when they come for on-site inspection,'' <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> said. `` All they can see, with any significance, is we have a lot of trees,'' said <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>. At the static test site, the two <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> stages _ each about nine feet long and 40 inches in diameter, will be locked in turn horizontally on a metal-and-concrete stand and ignited. Each stage contains thousands of pounds of granular propellant. Static firing takes about 45 seconds, while open-air burning of the fuel requires 10-15 minutes, <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> said. But he added static firing is environmentally perferred because the combustion is more complete. The plant's pine forests will help to muffle noise from the rocket motors, <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON> said.

 A 49-year-old convict who claims he died two years ago and should be freed from his life sentence lost his case Thursday when a judge ruled he never legally died. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> hoped to convince <LOCATION> Cayuga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> that he `` died'' during open heart surgery, was brought bac to life by doctors and therefore had fulfilled his sentence of life in prison. <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> ruled instead that <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> failed to meet the definition of death set forth in 1984 by the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the state's highest court; it said death occurs when there is no brain activity or the heart and lungs irreversibly stop functioning. `` As his presence in this courtroom indicates ... he did not die,'' <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, who was returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> after the ruling, said he planned to appeal. During the hourlong hearing, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> maintained that the definition of death was ambiguous and that two kinds of death existed, irreversible and reversible. He argued that he died a natural death when his heart stopped during surgery and was revived by artificial means. `` The higher courts, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has never defined death. They've defined life,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said in a crowded courtroom. `` Reversible death, which is a medical term, means they bring you back from death to life, not life to life.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general, presented affidavits from doctors that countered <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>'s claim. `` Thousands of people undergo bypass surgery, recover, and are, therefore, not pronounced dead,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner. And the cardiac surgeon who performed the operation on <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohman </PERSON>, wrote that having a patient's heart stop during heart bypass does not `` represent any untoward occurrence.'' <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, who was convicted for the 1963 murder of two policemen, if he believed that everyone whose heart stopped during heart surgery should be considered legally dead. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said yes. That would mean, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> surmised, that under <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>'s theory everyone who has heart surgery could collect on life insurance policies or be legally divorced, among other things. `` Yes, yes,'' said <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, who has earned several law degrees from correspondence schools during his 25 years in prison. `` I know this is far-reaching and I'm opening up a can of ... not worms, but boa constrictors.'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said he suspects <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> is just trying to get publicity for his planned second book and made-for-television movie called `` Afta Death.'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>'s life already has been the subject of a book and TV movie.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Plainclothesmen </LOCATION> briefly arrested the nephew of former Prime Minister Martial Celestin Thursday in a crackdown on supporters of deposed President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> by the new military government. `` He seems to have been arrested this morning,'' <PERSON> Celestin </PERSON> said of his nephew, <PERSON> Alix </PERSON> <PERSON> Celestin </PERSON>. `` I have no idea why.'' Family friends told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that armed men in civilian clothes took <PERSON> Alix </PERSON> <PERSON> Celestin </PERSON> away in handcuffs and stole what jewelry they could find in his house. A few hours later he was released `` thanks to the intervention of a very highly placed person,'' a friend of the family said, without elaborating. More than a dozen <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> supporters and their relatives, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, have been arrested after Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> overthrew <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> and proclaimed himself president early Monday. Others say they plan to go into hiding. The coup ended four months of civilian government and <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> went into exile. The military government confirmed several people were detained but gave no explanation for the roundup. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has protested the arrests and says at least two detainees are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens _ <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Savain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of former Information Minister <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Savain </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benodin </PERSON>, a top <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> adviser.

On Thursday, armed soldiers stood guard outside the sacked headquarters of <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The sidewalk was littered with desks, campaign posters and broken glass. `` We saw him -LRB- <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> -RRB- on television shaking his Uzi -LRB- machinegun -RRB-,'' said a 21-year-old maid, speaking on condition her name not be used. `` People who do n't understand are n't afraid. People who do understand are.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> headed a junta that governed <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for two years after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> turned over power last Feb. 7 to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who won presidential elections in January with the army's help. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> as military commander June 17 in a dispute over transfers of army officers and put him under house arrest. Soldiers freed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> Sunday night, captured the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and sent <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> into exile in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said he would travel to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Friday and leave for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over the weekend. Journalists at Haitian radio stations say they fear a media crackdown and will think twice before reporting controversial news. Haitians still remember the bloody reprisals of last summer, when soldiers opened fire on unarmed anti-government demonstrators and bystanders, killing more than 100 people. Thugs killed at least 34 people during presidential elections last Nov. 29, which were aborted to stop the violence. `` <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> has shown us what he can do, so what will happen is no mystery,'' said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON>, a hairdresser who spoke on condition she not be fully identified. Businessmen fear the army's latest takeover will provoke more capital flight and disinvestment by foreign assembly plants, which employ more than 40,000 Haitians. `` I think things can only get worse now,'' said a wholesale businessman who imports canned goods, dried fish and other foodstuffs. `` For two years he -LRB- <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> -RRB- did n't do any good for the country. I think people have lost all hope of betterment. There is no more democracy, no more progress, no more Constitution.''

<HEAD>Four Whites Assault Black Man In Queens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A black man who tried to aid a white woman on a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> street early Thursday was assaulted by at least three white men, who screamed racial slurs as they pummelled him with sticks and their fists, police said. It was the second racial attack in the city in two days. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON>, 25, was treated for cuts and bruises at a hospital, and one of his alleged assailants was later arrested. At least two other men were being sought. <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON>, reached by telephone at his home, refused to comment on the incident. It occurred one day after a black man walking home from work on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was attacked by six white men. He was defended by two white men at a pizzeria where he sought aid. Investigators said <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> was riding his bike home from visiting his girlfriend at 2:30 a.m. when he saw a white woman arguing with a white man in front of a bar in <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>. The white man walked away and <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> approached the white woman. `` Basically, he was offering her assistance,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of the police Bias Unit. Two white men standing across the street threw a bottle at the black man, began screaming racial slurs at Frederique and yelled `` you do n't belong here,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. The men began pushing and shoving <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON>, until he remounted his bike to escape. The men, and at least one other companion, followed <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> in a car and tried to run him off the road. They caught up with him, left their car and began beating the bicyclist with sticks and their fists. <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> abandoned his bike, and picked up a garbage can to defend himself, the captain said. The victim escaped his assailants and ran about two blocks to a gasoline station, where the attendant called police. Officers took <PERSON> Frederique </PERSON> through the neighborhood and he was able to identify one of his alleged assailants. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellier </PERSON>, 29, was charged with second-degree assault and aggravated harassment, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. In Wednesday's incident on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the six alleged assailants were arrested and charged with assault. Reports of bias incidents have decreased in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> in 1988, compared to 1987, but are on the rise citywide, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. There were 69 bias incidents reported in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> from January 1988 to May 31, 1988, down from 85 such incidents during the same period in 1987. However, as of May 31 of this year, 243 bias incidents were reported in the five boroughs, an increase over the 217 incidents reported in 1987.

<TEXT>
 A bank robber turned jailhouse journalist was released Thursday from solitary confinement, where he was put after reporting the federal prison where he is an inmate had become a `` caldron of fear, hatred and violence.'' <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 48, was released from the isolation unit at <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where he was placed Wednesday `` for his own protection,'' said <PERSON> Warden </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said the article in Sunday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle-Examiner </ORGANIZATION>, which accused him of a `` gulag mentality,'' created `` a degree of tension in the prison's inmate population'' and required segregating the inmate-writer until an investigation was completed. `` I could care less about criticism of this administration,'' said <PERSON> Rison </PERSON>. `` But I have had inmates say that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is not their spokesman, and I'm obligated to make sure he does n't get himself hurt. He walks around here rather freely.'' The article had the potential to set off a riot, <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said. Associate Warden <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> said an investigation found no threat to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` There was some grumbling about the article, but it was not significant enough to keep <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> in confinement,'' said <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON>. While he still was held in the 120-man isolation ward at the maximum-security prison, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview arranged by <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> that he was confined in retaliation for his article. `` There is really no threat to my safety,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who has written 20 articles for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> newspaper's Sunday Punch section in the last two years. `` I have n't encouraged any group demonstration. I just depict things as they are ... As long as my articles have veracity, I should be allowed to depict people. The public is entitled to a viewpoint other than the stereotype put out by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said that unless the newspaper allows him to tell his side in print, he will transfer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to another federal prison rather than risk anger among the inmates. `` It is obvious from the prison officials' comments that they are angry about the content of an article in the Chronicle,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, editor of the Sunday Punch section. `` If <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is being punished for that reason, it is a serious violation of the First Amendment.'' The Sunday Punch section publishes feature stories and opinion columns, such as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> has never called the newspaper asking to comment, but the newspaper would be willing to grant him space, <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said. In his articles, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` has never attempted to glamorize or apologize for the criminal,'' said <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>. `` In the 20 or so articles <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> has contributed to this section, I have found him to be a sensitive observer and a fresh, powerful writer with a deep commitment to justice,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, the Irish tenor best known as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s comic sidekick, was remembered Thursday as a loving man devoted to helping himself and others battle <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease Day, whose trademarks were the line `` Gee, Mr. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'' and skits in which he tricked the comedian into letting him unleash his singing voice, died at 71 late Wednesday night at his <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> home. He had never fully recovered from a fall 3 -LCB- months ago, and returned home after treatment this week at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. The cause of death was pneumonia, said his mother-in-law, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Almquist </PERSON>. `` I'm very, very saddened by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' death,'' said comedian <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Muscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dystrophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for which Day worked. `` He was a great friend _ to me and to so many during his life. When he found out that he had ALS _ the disease that led inexorably to his death _ he put all the remaining energy he had into helping <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION> fight this tragic disorder.'' Doctors discovered last summer that Day had amyotropic lateral sclerosis, the nerve disorder known as <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease that causes gradual loss of muscle control. He injured his head in the fall March 9 and had been hospitalized more than four weeks since then, at times in critical condition. Day's wife and Mrs. <PERSON> Almquist </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, was admitted to St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s on Wednesday for cardiac tests and was in fair condition Thursday, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Armen </PERSON> <PERSON> Markarian </PERSON> said. He added that doctors had not determined whether she suffered a heart attack. Day played a dimwitted stooge on <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s radio and TV variety shows, but he was shrewd in his contract maneuvering with studios and networks. `` I'm sorry about <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. I thought he was one of a kind,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, who knew Day for 40 years. `` Through the tutorage of my pal, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, he became a very good foil and straight man character for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>. Show business is going to miss him.'' `` He was a great actor and great comedian and a great foil for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>. He was the crazy kid who did the silly things. They got along very well together,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s former manager who now manages <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Day was also recalled as a family man who chose to spend time with his 10 children rather than running with a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> crowd. `` Warm, wonderful, loving, caring, always giving,'' is how actress <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Blyth </PERSON> remembered her brother-in-law. The star of `` <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>,'' `` Kismet'' and `` The <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> Story'' is married to Day's brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, and recalled the large family get-togethers with their five children and Day's 10. `` Our family get-togethers were indeed warm and wonderful memories to have,'' Miss <PERSON> Blyth </PERSON> said. `` To lose someone so dear is indeed a great loss, but when you have lovely memories, it somehow makes it easier.'' `` Americans could n't do any better for the likes of a role-model husband and father than <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>,'' added <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, host of the old `` This is Your Life'' and `` Truth or Consequences'' shows. Born <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> to Irish parents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on May 21, 1917, he was graduated from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> with plans to enter <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION>'s law school But then he learned <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> needed a singer to replace <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. A recording Day had made earned him an audition, and an off-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job. He assumed the name <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> when he joined <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s radio show as a singer in 1939. `` Gee, Mr. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>!'' became a trademark line on <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s radio and TV variety shows. The remark came from Day when a skit situation seemed to overwhelm him. Besides his success as a foil, Day gained popularity as an Irish tenor with his renditions of `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s Band,'' `` Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and other ballads. Another Day favorite, `` Peg of my Heart'' was a ballad he sang for his wife. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> and Day began appearing on TV in 1950, and in 1951 Day landed a movie contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he was the only <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> contract player with television rights. He also signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, after allowing weeks of bidding between the network and competitor CBS. Day is survived by his wife, a brother, six sons, four daughters, and 13 grandchildren. Funeral services are planned next week, depending on Mrs. <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>'s health.

Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, at a weekly briefing, said a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> article last week saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would give refuge to <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> was `` highly irresponsible. ... Such a report is absolutely groundless.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also denied <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is ready to accept a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government without the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the communist faction it backs with arms and supplies. `` We favor a four-party coalition of <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB- under the leadership of Prince -LRB- <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. We are not in favor of any single party taking power nor are we in favor of exclusion of any other party,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> signaled in private its backing for a Cambodian government without the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which launched a reign of terror during its 1975-78 rule, during which more than a million people died. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> support a three-party resistance coalition led by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The resistance is calling for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops that have occupied <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since late 1978 and the forming of a four-party government including the Vietnam-backed faction holding the capital of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. Little is known of the current activities of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leader during the 1975-78 bloodbath, but both <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have expressed concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> might regain power after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws and <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and other fanatic leftists might re-emerge. Asked if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s plans to host informal `` cocktail party'' talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> next month that will for the first time bring together the rival factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, `` it is worth giving it a try.'' He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supports all efforts by <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> countries for a `` fair and reasonable settlement'' to the Cambodian question, adding that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> believes the rapid withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops is the key to any settlement. He criticized <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s statements that it will pull out 50,000 of its 120,000 troops this year and leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 or 1991, saying the timetable was too slow. `` This only shows that up to now, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has no sincerity to settle the question of <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said that in the past, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s proclaimed withdrawals turned out to be mere troop rotations. `` People are entitled to call for strict international supervision and on-the-spot verification of the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea.''

 <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON>, who died from AIDS at age 44, was remembered Thursday for his 13-year battle against gay stereotypes, beginning with his discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for declaring his homosexuality. `` He saw the gay rights struggles of the 1980s as the equivalent of black civil rights struggles of the'50s and'60s,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>, former owner of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> radio station where <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> conducted a weekly talk show. <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON>, who waged a public battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> after he was discharged for homosexuality in 1975, died Wednesday night friend in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where he had moved in April from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said friend <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> died peacefully in the presence of relatives and friends.

The new state charges against <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> were included in indictments returned by separate grand juries sitting in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> counties. The five indictments released in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> charge <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION> with seven counts of violating the state conflict-of-interest law, seven counts of larceny, 13 counts of forgery, two counts of submitting false documents to a state agency, three counts of filing false state income tax returns and violations of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> fraud law. The <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> indictments, covering <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s actions as <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION> president, include three counts of larceny, five counts of forgery and one conflict charge. He is to be arraigned in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on July 5 and in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on July 6. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldings </PERSON>, did not immediately return a reporter's telephone call. The <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> charges allege that <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>, while a public official, had a financial interest in state contracts awarded by the state, by <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> indictments, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> is charged with forging the deed and other documents on land owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> was building a house. The other larceny counts relate to <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s alleged misuse of the foundation's funds, and the conflict charge relates to a $ 7,500 payment from the foundation to <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, in which <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> had a financial interest. If convicted, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> faces maximum penalties of 10 years in state prison on each of the 13 forgery counts, five years in prison and a fine of $ 25,000 on the larceny charges, five years in prison and a fine of $ 10,000 on the fraud counts, two years in prison and a $ 3,000 fine on the conflict counts and three years and a $ 100,000 fine on the tax charges. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> pleaded guilty in federal court in April on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, perjury and making false statements on tax returns between 1979 and 1983, before he became a top <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide. The prosecution plans to recommend <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> serve 5 years in prison and pay restitution of up to $ 80,000 for money siphoned out of an adult education program through fraudulent billing, phony employees and embezzled checks. Three co-codefendants in the federal case pleaded guilty to a variety of charges.

 Someone with a sense of fowl play keeps stealing the city's duck crossing signs, so street officials have decided to sell the yello caution signs to pay the bills. The duck silhouette on a diamond-shaped sign is supposed to warn motorists to watch for ducks crossing the street near a neighborhood park pond. Since first installing the caution signs about two years ago, the city has put up about 20 of the signs. All have disappeared. At $ 75 apiece, the street department is out $ 1,500 for the signs, said <PERSON> Garold </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the town's streets department. He said officials figure the missing signs have become wall hangings in dormitories and bedrooms. Officials decided last week they would bow to market demand and offer the signs for sale at $ 28 to $ 35 apiece. `` I do n't know if it will do any good but we thought we would try to sell them,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` We are not here to make a profit. The people in the area want the ducks protected.''

 A study published today shows that the acne medicine Accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin cancer in humans, but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for routine use. Accutane, a vitamin A derivative that can cause birth defects in pregnant women, sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited genetic disorder, the study shows. While Accutane can not be taken for long periods by most people, other synthetic forms of vitamin A may someday be routinely used to prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years of exposure to the sun, the researchers said. In addition, vitamin A drugs may someday be used to treat other tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, bladder, cervix and breast, said Dr. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The odds are that within the lifetime of many people, we may well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer in high-risk people,'' he said.

 A civic group has taken a novel approach to supporting its local police by taking out a $ 1 million insurance policy to cover the township's eight officers if they are killed in the line of duty.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a strong 3.6 percent rate in the first three months of 1988, prompting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday to make what was once considered a too-rosy forecast even rosier. After the October stock market collapse, many private economists expected a slowdown or even a recession this year. They criticized as unrealistic White House projections saying the economy, as measured by the gross national product, would grow at a steady 2.9 percent pace, the same as in 1986 and 1987. But booming growth in the last three months of 1987 and continued strength this year sent analysts scrambling to revise their forecasts upward until the administration estimate began looking pessimistic.

 Viewers who do n't want to stay up half the night this fall can get a glimpse of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new late-night talk show host, sports announcer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>, when he takes a turn as guest co-host on `` Today,'' beginning Monday. On Aug. 22, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>' show, `` Later with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>,'' premieres. It will follow `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' Monday through Friday at 1:30 a.m. EDT. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> hopes a homey set and varied guest list will quickly disabuse viewers of the notion that <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> is a sports guy and must be doing a sports show. Some of the guests already booked include <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, activist <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, comedians <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mull </PERSON>, talk-show host <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, journalists <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON>, film critics <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON>, sex therapist Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, singers Meatloaf and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathers </PERSON> as `` the Beaver.'' Sports figures wo n't be ignored. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Uecker </PERSON> have been booked, and <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> hopes to get <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> on the show, too. `` If we do get sports figures, it would be because the interest in them transcends sports fans,'' <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> said. `` We're going to get a really good cross-section of people that I think will appeal to viewers that have watched the <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> show. We hope we can keep some of the people that are watching <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> at 1:30 and pick up some strays. You know, milkmen who are getting ready to go to work, precocious paper boys.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> is one in a series of fill-ins for `` Today'' co-host <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, who is off getting ready for his duties as anchor of the network's coverage of the Summer Olympics. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> will go to the Olympics, too, and appear on a wrap-up that will pre-empt the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> late-night schedule, including his own show. It has been widely speculated that <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> wo n't want to return to the early-morning grind after his high-profile stint in prime time. So Costas, along with other guest hosts, has been presumed under consideration to replace him. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>' predecessors in the recent host-of-the-week series have included <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON>. All three are consummate professionals in their element, but only <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> seemed comfortable with the `` Today'' format. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> dismisses speculation about the `` Today'' slot but avoids issuing an unequivocal rejection of the idea. `` I think the thing that no reasonably intelligent person would say _ ` No I'll never do that.' Stupid thing to say. But is it something I'm thinking about doing, something that concerns me, something I'm pointing toward doing? Absolutely not.'' How well he does next week notwithstanding, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> is considered to have star potential by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, whose talk-show king, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, is approaching retirement age. And the cushy schedule of `` Later'' would be hard for Costas to give up. The show is taped one day a week, then he's free to continue his first love, covering baseball. And if the show is successful and is picked up beyond the current 26-show commitment, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> will move it for the summer to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, his hometown. A `` Today'' job would require him to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> almost all the time. `` I'm well aware that some very substantial people in this business have done that -LRB- `` Today'' -RRB- job, and even to be mentioned in connection with it is flattering and an honor, et cetera, et cetera,'' <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> said. `` However, I think the most important thing that someone should do is do what makes them happy, not fulfill somebody else's idea of what the next highest-ranking job is and what the next step up the ladder is and what your next ambition should be. `` My ambition is to do a good job at what I do and to be happy. And I'm very, very, very happy anytime I'm at a baseball game.''

<DATELINE>SPENCERS WOOD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> worries that the rolling green countryside of <LOCATION> Spencers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION> is endangered, that throngs from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> 35 miles to the east will pour into tracts of houses where now there are trees and meadows. He heads a group of 450 local residents opposing the suburbanization of their countryside in <LOCATION> Spencers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> where tiny villages are designated by the government as the sites for thousands of new homes for people overflowing from crowded <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The battle of <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> is a test case in a political controversy brewing across southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION>, a ring of protected land around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, has put housing-development pressure on more outlying rural areas like Spencers Wood. `` Once the atmosphere goes, it's no longer country living, so to speak,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> as he surveyed smokestacks and a sea of rowhouses on one side of the highway running through the area and the green land on the other. The issue touches sensitive political nerves. Critics, even in Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, say that by funneling development to the wealthy southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the government is ignoring the economically ailing north and widening national divisions. Environment Minister <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> and developers argue that houses must be built where they are needed, and that's in the south. They maintain that denying free-market forces, a cornerstone of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s policies, would dampen southern growth. `` This issue is potentially as explosive for the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Conservatives -RRB- as any that has caused rumblings of discontent within their ranks during the past decade,'' commented the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. At the heart of the controversy is the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION>, the 1.2 million acres set aside 50 years ago around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to keep the city from sprawling to the sea, give it a `` green lung,'' and preserve the city's character. Belts around other cities followed and <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belts </ORGANIZATION> now cover 14 percent of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. As part of her goal of transforming <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> into `` a property-owning democracy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> wants everyone to have the chance to buy a home. But she could not touch the Green Belts without alienating large numbers of voters in the south, her electoral heartland. The planned Channel Tunnel linking southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the growth of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as a financial capital have sent real estate prices soaring and added greater burdens on hospitals and other services. Opponents like <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> say it's fine to protect the Green Belts, but unfair to make the countryside pay the price. They say inner cities should be revitalized with new housing. `` We think it's bad management for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s inner cities to be depopulating and green fields to be built over,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggin </PERSON>, a lawmaker who opposes his <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s development policy. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bate </PERSON>, senior planner for the 60-year-old Council for the Protection of Rural <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- CPRE -RRB-, says: `` If we continue to have major housebuilding and investment in the southeast and not in other parts of the country, the problem of two nations under one government is going to become even greater than it already is.'' <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> argues that city dwellers `` need parks and green spaces and gardens, too, and resent the implication that all development can just be dumped in their backyard.'' The controversy heated up in February after <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> increased estimates of southeast housing needs from 460,000 homes to a possible 610,000 by the year 2000. `` We've taken -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- as a test case because it is the county under the greatest pressure,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CPRE </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bate </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's an area which has seen a doubling of its housing stock in the last 30 years, where villages have already been absorbed into main towns.'' A right-wing think tank, the <ORGANIZATION> Adam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, has suggested reviving <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> land that was once used for industry and fell derelict after the conservation area was introduced. It says up to 40 percent of the belt consists of such `` brown'' patches and proposes letting developers in provided they also make other spoiled areas `` green'' again. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and his neighbors, in the meantime, worry about what they will lose. Small developments already peek from behind the trees and old homes of their region. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> already has encroached.

 After $ 4.9 million worth of renovations to bring the White House of the Confederacy to its Civil War-time stateliness, restorers are welcoming visitors again to `` the executive mansion of another nation.'' The house, built in 1818, was leased to the Confederate government for use as the residence of President <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, and in it he often mapped war strategy with his generals, including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Stonewall'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It gives a glimpse into the life of the South's first family while reflecting the decline and death of the Confederate States of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` As the war went on, the quality of what was served went down,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, director of development and public relations at the house and the Museum of the Confederacy next door. By the end of the Civil War, he said, the White House was serving `` what became known as <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> punch _ water.'' <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, the capital of the Confederacy, had bought the house for $ 42,000 in 1861. Three decades after the war, in 1896, it opened as the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> but closed in 1976 when its Confederate collections were moved to the new museum. Its restoration and reopening this month were underwritten by $ 4.9 million in private, corporate, state and federal donations. `` We feel like the White House is one of the most important historical houses in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. `` It was the executive mansion of another nation. Whether you're from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, it played a big part in our destiny.'' The three-story Classical Revival-style White House, actually painted a pale gray, stands in the heart of the city's historic <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> district. Visitors can tread on a re-creation of the white carpet on which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> inadvertently tracked mud. Restorers learned the carpet was white from a reference <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Varina </PERSON>, made to the incident. `` General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> came up from camp one day evidently worn out and worried, to find Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> lying quite ill on a divan, in a little morning-room in which we received only our intimate friends,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> recalled in her memoirs. `` General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, with a bow and excuse for coming in on the white carpet with his splashed boots, sat down and plunged at once into army matters.'' Visitors also can see the second-floor office where <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to discuss strategy and the front parlor where <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> entertained the public, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. Authenticity was important to those restoring the house. The only non-period pieces in sight are smoke alarms. Most of the furniture in the house was used by the <ORGANIZATION> Davises </ORGANIZATION> in the four years they lived there and was donated to the restoration effort. A painted floor cloth in the round entranceway `` was very trendy at the time.'' `` Anything that's not a Davis piece is of the period,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. Most of the gaslight chandeliers in the house are original and have been restored. `` We could have used substitutes, and 99 percent of the public never would have known,'' he said. Restorers analyzed the paint on the furniture to determine which coat was on top when <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> lived in the house. Reproducing textiles throughout the house cost `` quite a bit over'' $ 100,000, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> textile reproduction company created a green and gold silk for the drapes and an ottoman in the dining room that is almost identical to the fabric in place 123 years ago. `` We have these original fabrics. These are pieces of history. If we can recreate them, we make every effort,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. It was painstaking work, copying the original design on graph paper, dying yarn to match the original colors and hand-tying 15,000 threads individually to a loom, said <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitter </PERSON>, one of the owners of Scalamandre, a restoration consultant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The silk left the loom at a rate of only 4 -LCB- yards in an 8-hour workday, she said. The pattern still is not an exact copy because the patterns in the new fabric do not repeat at the same rate, Mrs. Bitter said. It could have been done for another $ 30,000. Restorers discovered the house had one more room than previously thought _ a secretary's office adjacent to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>'. They found a joint that indicated where a wall had once been. Among furniture and other items that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his family used are his office chair and desk. Many other items left in the pockets of Northern soldiers while the house was being used as <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> headquarters after the war. `` A lot of Union officers took souvenirs from the house and a lot of them have found their way back,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. Many were returned when the museum first opened in the house at the turn of the century. Others, such as spurs <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> wore, have come back within the last month.

 Discarded plastic, already blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of birds and fish in the oceans and along seashores, is spreading to the Great Lakes. The virtually indestructible material is becoming not just an eyesore but a potential threat to wildlife in the world's largest freshwater system, according to researchers and lay observers. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Benzonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has operated fishing charter boats for 15 years in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. He said he's found plastic debris floating up to 10 miles offshore, some of it in `` scum lines'' of garbage a mile long. `` There's more plastic bags and pieces of Visquine -LRB- a trade name for plastic sheeting -RRB- in the lake than I've ever seen,'' <PERSON> Mattis </PERSON> said. `` It's gotten worse in the last three or four years. `` I've heard a lot of people say, ` It's just a plastic bag.' They do n't realize the damage it can do.'' Most legislation, research and enforcement has focused on a different kind of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> pollution _ toxic chemicals that threaten widespread areas and can be traced to specific sources. `` There're about 1,000 different types of hazardous substances that are known to exist in the Great Lakes,'' said <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a research analyst with the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, toxics -LRB- and -RRB- contaminated sediments are the No. 1 thing.'' Plastic pollution is less fully understood, although its potential for harm is clear. A single shard of plastic sheeting, six-pack beverage carrier or strand of fishing line can float undetected until it strangles fish or birds, binds a boat propeller or jams an engine intake. `` We see the pictures every year; we know it happens,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudderar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> biologist. `` But we do n't have any research on to what extent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> estimated that one bird in 100 observed by biologists was entangled in plastic fishing line, according to a 1987 report by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Entanglement can also mean ingestion of the plastic. Little is known, too, about another synthetic material intentionally put into the lakes: fishing nets that are loosed accidentally, but continue trapping their prey. `` Ghost fishing'' has been documented mainly along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coasts. But it also occurs in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> waters where gill-net fishing is done, either by state-regulated commercial interests or by Indians working under terms of federal treaties, officials said. `` From the fisheries' standpoint, the worst thing we've got is gill nets that break away,'' said <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, manager of the Great Lakes Program of the state DNR's Fisheries Division. Just last month, authorities retrieved a gill net containing more than 600 pounds of rotting lake trout. The 1,000-foot-long, 44-inch-wide net probably had been adrift several months in southern <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>, investigators said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eger </PERSON>, a biologist who works with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Indian fishermen, said gill nets occasionally are abandoned or torn from buoys in storms or by passing freighters. But the approximately 350 Indians who fish in the treaty-protected waters of northwestern <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and south central <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> usually set and retrieve their gill nets daily, <PERSON> Eger </PERSON> said. Since gill nets cost about $ 1 a yard, they're seldom abandoned, he said. Those that are n't retrieved tend to `` ball up'' and sink, bearing only the fish trapped on the first day or two after being set, he said. `` It does not continue to catch fish at an exponential rate, as <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would like to have you believe,'' <PERSON> Eger </PERSON> said. Charter skipper <PERSON> Mattis </PERSON> said plastic refuse poses a threat to navigation. `` My son last year blew out an engine when a plastic bag got sucked up in the intake,'' he said. `` I had a piece two years ago ... an 8-foot piece of Visquine that got around my prop. It would n't come off, it knotted up so bad. Luckily a shaft did n't break. The governor has signed legislation that will make <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> the 13th state _ and the second in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region after <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ to require that six-pack beverage carriers be made of plastic material that degrades within 360 days of exposure to sunlight. The bill awaits action in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Enforcement of anti-dumping laws is isolated, conceded Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, chief of the Marine Safety Division of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s district office in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Disposal of solid waste anywhere in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> has been illegal for years, <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said. Freighters and other large commercial vessels are required to store or incinerate their trash rather than dump it overboard, a practice common among oceangoing ships and blamed for at least part of the plastic pollution at sea. `` For the pleasure boaters, I do n't think you're going to find any enforcement,'' <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said. `` We have n't apprehended anyone. ... You're talking about an individual-type problem.'' Department of Natural Resources biologists have estimated that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s recreational boaters produce up to 26,000 tons of garbage a year. An unknown percentage of that total finds its way into the lakes. The plastics industry has joined government and environmental groups in conducting public education campaigns about plastic pollution in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and oceans alike. Brochures describing the harm done to marine life by discarded plastic, have been jointly distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entanglement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. The <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and Defenders of Wildlife, another Washington-based environmental group, have distributed similar brochures encouraging boaters and beach visitors to dispose of trash properly. Individuals can do the most to turn back the invasion of plastic flotsam, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Office of the Great Lakes: `` The absolute key thing is people's individual responsibility, that it has consequences for the environment.''

 As they size up the outlook for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy at mid-1988, many analysts see good prospects for continued growth over the next six months or so. There are several cloudy spots in their crystal balls, however, thanks to some unusual trends and unfolding events that defy measurement. The drought in the Farm Belt, for one, looms as a potential wild card whose long-term economic implications can not yet be gauged. In addition, there is the presidential election coming in November, the outcome of which seems likely to affect in unknown ways the continued progress of an economic expansion that will be entering its seventh year about the time the voters go to the polls. Four years ago, many forecasters felt safe in assuming that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be re-elected and would make no dramatic changes in economic policy. This time, there is widespread uncertainty about which candidate will prevail and on what sort of platform. By almost all accounts, the economy enters the second half of the year in sounder shape than anyone dared hope last winter. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, projects growth of the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation at a 3.6 percent rate for all of 1988, up from 2.9 percent last year. The economy, he said, `` is in transition from being led by the 1983-1986 consumer spending boom to being led in 1987-1989 by trade and net exports.'' The White House on Thursday revised its growth estimate for 1988 upward, to 3.5 percent from an earlier prediction of 2.9 percent. In the view of a good many analysts, continued improvement is likely in the trade deficit, led by the export boom. `` It is now clear that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit is declining,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Material improvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and a bottom for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar are the most fundamental issues confronting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and world financial markets.'' One big question that remains for the outlook is whether the economy will reach the point where expansion turns into an inflationary force. According to <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, `` although growth seems secure for 1988, rising inflation and interest rates suggest the economy is vulnerable to a modest recession in 1989.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the economy has entered `` the full employment zone'' where capacity of operating facilities and the labor force could begin to show signs of strain `` The problem for economic policies in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is to somehow traverse the full employment zone without an unacceptable acceleration of inflation and the instability that has always created a turning point for the expansion and, then, a subsequent recession,'' he asserts. If the drought in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> continues much longer, analysts say its effects could start to spread beyond the region and the farm economy. Rising prices of basic commodities that become scarcer than expected because of the drought naturally evoke visions of increased inflation. However, some observers say the effect may more complicated than that. As <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, suggested: `` Over the next several months, rising food prices are likely to absorb a growing portion of most people's budgets, since food demand is generally insensitive to price `` But this may serve to intensify consumer resistance to price increases on other goods. Thus, unless income growth suddenly accelerates, real consumer spending can be expected to remain soft.''

 Secret documents recently declassified and opened to public view confirm behind-the-scenes efforts by President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and top military commanders to manipulate <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public opinion of the Vietnam War and reverse growing opposition. In one memo, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> commanders were told to `` make it clear to all concerned that expressing criticism to news media representatives and others will serve only to aggravate the issues surrounding our problems in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' It was signed by Adm. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, commander of American forces in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> himself was described in some messages as wanting to play down military operations in 1968 so as not to upset efforts to get the North Vietnamese to enter peace talks. The 12 million pages at the National Archives are one-sixth of the 72 million pages of Army documents that will be released in installments. The next batch will be released in April 1990. The papers' topics range from battlefield reports to a division commander's concern that his troops were taking radios and comic books to the front lines, making them less vigilant against <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> attack. But the most significant papers are the exchanges between <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s sensitivity to criticism and his administration's efforts to put the most favorable light on an unpopular war were widely reported at the time, the papers provide an inside view of official thinking. One particular message, signed by Gen. <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, illustrates the administration's thrust. It was sent Jan. 31, 1968, at the start of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Tet offensive, which began turning Americans against their involvement in the distant war. In the memo, Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> was told that President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> wanted him to make a brief personal comment to the press at least once each day `` to convey to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people your confidence in our capability to blunt these enemy moves and to reassure the public here that you have the situation under control.'' But even as <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> received the memo, the situation was chaotic, with North Vietnamese and <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> troops attacking more than 100 cities and towns on the second day of their three-day Lunar New Year, called Tet. They suffered heavy casualties but showed the vulnerability of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s cities, sending a message to Americans that no end to the war was near. In the two weeks of the offensive, more than 1,000 Americans were killed, increasing frustration and dismay back home. The papers also reveal that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s decision two months later to halt the bombing of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in hopes of coaxing the enemy to the peace table was instead taken by military officers as an opportunity to lay low in bad weather and sway public opinion at the same time. The president appeared on national television March 31, 1968, to announce the cessation of bombing above the 20th Parallel. He then stunned listeners when he added that he would neither seek nor accept the Democratic nomination for a second term. In a memo dated the same day and apparently reflecting prior knowledge of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s announcement, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> commander, pointed out to <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> that the bombling halt was timed just right. `` Since the Tet offensive, support in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> for the war in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> has decreased at an accelerating rate,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> wrote. `` Many of the strongest proponents of forceful action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have reversed their positions, have moved to neutral ground or are wavering. If this trend continues unchecked, public support of our objectives in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will be too frail to sustain the effort. `` Weather over the northern portion of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will continue unsuitable for air operations during the next 30 days; therefore if a cessation of air operations is to be undertaken, now is the best time from the military viewpoint. `` It is hoped that this unilateral initiative to seek peace will reverse the growing dissent and opposition within our country to the war. The initiative will aid in countering foreign criticism.'' In another March 31 message, <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> advised <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> that at a White House meeting that night, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` cited the fact that we have been accused in the past of always accompanying peace initiatives with increased military activity.'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the president was aware of ongoing operations to open Route 9 and lift the North Vietnamese siege of the American base at <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION>, one of the most widely reported campaigns of the war. `` The purpose of this message is not to have you stand down those operations,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> told <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>. `` However, it is desired that you, your subordinate commanders and your PA -LRB- public affairs -RRB- people play them low key. ... You and your people should take care to describe these operations as being merely in the usual run of offensive operations.'' The battle to free <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION>, however, was hardly `` usual.'' More than 200 Marines were killed and 1,600 wounded in the 77-day siege, which was lifted April 5. In the meantime, air strikes continued in the less populous southern panhandle of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and the administration failed to manipulate the press to its liking. When it was reported in mid-April that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers had launched the heaviest air strikes of the war in the panhandle, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was furious, prompting a cable April 16 from <LOCATION> Wheeler </LOCATION> to Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and others, including <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION>. `` Apparently, the president was considerably chafed by TV and radio newscasts ... to effect that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> unleashed yesterday heaviest air attacks of war against panhandle of NVN -LRB- <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. `` The president thinks we are handing a case to those who profess that our actions are contrary to his 31 March speech by providing so much detail ... to the news media.'' Sharp and <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> suggested to <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> that if bombing were to be renewed beyond the panhandle, their commands should decline comment to the press. Responding on May 23, <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said: `` As I advised you previously, the highest authority -LRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -RRB- desires the noise level to be kept low in such eventuality _ i.e, no announcements to the press giving details of weight or effort, targets struck, etc. `` I must say, <PERSON> Westy </PERSON>, that your proposal and the rationale behind it make good sense: specifically, that you make no announcements but be permitted to confirm that a particular target has been struck if such question is asked.'' The North Vietnamese did agree to peace talks, which opened in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> May 13, 1968. But it was almost five more years, on Jan. 27, 1973, until an agreement was reached ending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in the war. American forces and prisoners of war returned home. The opposing Vietnamese sides ignored the agreement's call for a cease-fire and continued fighting until <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> fell to the North Vietnamese on April 30, 1975.

 The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war's messengers of death are inescapable at the National Archives. The daily journals, the annual history of the <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nang </PERSON> mortuary, the certificates of death, the records of things left behind _ a peace medal, a Bible, tape cassettes _ are abundant in the 12 million pages of Army documents recently made public. Together, they chronicle the heavy toll paid by the 58,156 men and women who died in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nang </PERSON> mortuary report tells of processing the remains of 5,377 Americans in 1969 and notes that the number of casualties was generally higher in March through May of each year because of regular North Vietnamese and <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> offensives. The second entry in the daily staff journal of the 74th Medical Battalion at <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> on June 8, 1969, brought the dreaded knock on the door back home in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. `` 1. 0001 Journal opened. `` 2. 0550 Rocket attack 312th area. Resulted in the death of a nurse. `` 3. 0720 SFC <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> called SP5 Ellafrits, 312th Evac, on the casualty report on the death of 1LT Sharon A. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, N2337551, 283-38-3327, 312th Evac, as a result of attack at 0550 hrs ...'' While it was morning in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, it was the previous evening in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> time was 11 hours ahead. The Lanes heard sketchy details of the rocket attack on the evening news. `` Right after that came a knock on the door and we saw this Army car sitting in the driveway,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, now 64, recalled in a telephone interview. `` When he -LRB- the Army officer -RRB- came to the door, even before my husband got there, I said, ` Is she dead?' He said, ` Yes.'''

 Amid documents recording the battles, decisions and agony of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the war's lighter and slighter moments were also dutifully noted in the 12 million pages of Army papers recently opened to the public at the National Archives. Here is a sampling.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 An infantry captain inquiring about the availability of black-eyed peas was told by headquarters that this Southern specialty was not on the Army's master menu. How could that be, he asked, since one unit he knew of had several pallets of peas and its supply officer had promised the division general, `` Yes, general, the troops will have black-eyed peas for New Year's day.'' Besides, the captain said, the black-eyed peas matter, as it was termed in the papers, was of interest to the president of the black-eyed pea industry as well as to Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native. The captain was told that the peas in question were either surplus from the commissary store or had been mistakenly unloaded in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The military log dated Jan. 2, 1968, reporting this exchange, had this final entry: ACTION TAKEN None.

<TEXT>
 Speaking of <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION>, when the king of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> learned the general was planning a visit in May 1968, he invited the general over to talk since Thai troops were serving with the allied forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, who was accompanying her husband, was excluded. As the charge d'affaires of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> explained in this cable to <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION>: `` We have learned from the king's chief aide-de-camp that his majesty is looking forward to a rather lengthy serious discussion of the war with you, and -LRB- his aide -RRB- expressed the view that ` this might be tiresome for the ladies.' Since I take this to be a clear indication of the king's preference for a serious stag talk, I am inclined to let it rest that way. Accordingly ... we have planned the itinerary with this in view.''

 When Lt. Col. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, an Army dentist stationed in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, was asked if he had any equipment problems, he was blunt: `` I had some jackass come over from the States.

He came in and looked at the X-ray machine and he told me I could not use it because we did not have a lead screen. `` I told him, ` You see my name.' I had my name on my uniform and I said, ` I set that X-ray machine up. ... I get people sent in here from all over the country to get an X-ray taken. I am going to continue using it and you can put that in your report.' ... I never heard any further.''

<HEAD>Rival Teachers Unions Differ on Approach to School Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's rival teacher unions are heading to their conventions with differing approaches to school reform but closer than ever in their criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. American Federation of Teachers President <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> will ask his 3,000 delegates at their July 2-6 convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to endorse his call for a myriad of experimental `` schools within schools.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, the president of the giant <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, will seek from her 8,000 delegates, meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> July 4-7, an endorsement of her proposal to create an experimental lighthouse district in each state where `` anything goes.'' Like the rest of the labor movement, both the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and the AFT have refrained from endorsing a candidate for president. That could change for the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> as early as next Saturday when its board of directors meets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s political action committee will consider an endorsement on Friday. If it decides to make an endorsement, the 1.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> would be the first major union to back Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The AFT, like its parent <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, is holding its fire, but its leaders are not. Both <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, the AFT's political director, will be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, a Mondale delegate in 1984 and a political activist in her home state of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, will not be a delegate this time around. But <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Melley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of government relations, said the union will have a contingent of about 250 delegates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with a large majority for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and several dozen for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> fielded nearly 400 delegates in 1984 at the Democratic convention. Both unions now are unremittingly hostile to the education policies of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his secretary of education, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has accused teacher unions of trying to `` hijack'' the school reform movement with extortionate demands for more money without increased accountability. The AFT, which has criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s education cuts, invited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to address its convention five years ago and heard him shower the union with praise for being open-minded on things such as merit pay and for supporting a rigorous curriculum. Whatever openness the AFT exhibited then, it has since reverted to a stance as critical of merit pay as any taken by the NEA. Indeed, one of the nation's largest experiments with merit pay is underway in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the 10th biggest school district, where most of the teachers belong to the NEA. A resolution on education reform that will be debated by the AFT delegates says many of the reforms launched since the 1983 report `` A Nation At Risk'' has been bad. Of merit pay, it says, `` Traditional merit pay schemes, now bearing new names, continue to rear their unsubstantiated heads.'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, unlike <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, is still on the White House guest list for education events. Or at least he was until this spring, when he emerged from a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of `` A Nation At Risk'' to write a barbed open letter to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> accusing him of a `` major failure of leadership.'' `` Instead of leading your troops, you kept shooting at them,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said in an interview, `` It took him 3 -LCB- years to realize Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was not an advocate for education.'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said he does not regret the AFT policy of willingness to entertain any and all school reform proposals. His affiliates in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, have received wide attention for contracts that give teachers more say in school management and peer review, but also hold them accountable for improved performance. `` I think we have fairly widespread acceptance now of things that were considered pretty radical a few years ago,'' including peer review and wider teacher involvement in decision making, <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. But he remains deeply pessimistic about the current structure of most public schools, which <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> contends deliver an inadequate education to 80 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students. That is why he favors radical and widespread experimentation with new forms of school organization. The resolution backed by the AFT's Executive Council would put the union on record as favoring <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s idea of allowing groups of six to 12 teachers the wherewithal to set up their own schools within school, provided they got the approval of their local union and school board, and could convince enough teachers, parents and students to voluntarily sign up for the type of instruction they were offering. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said she hopes her lighthouse school district proposal will lead to establishment of model districts in all 50 states. `` We want them to feel free to experiment. What we want is to fundamentally and systemically restructure school systems. We're willing to look at everything,'' she said At the same time, the union would insist that such models not be created by top-down fiat, but through consensus among all affected constituencies: parents, teachers, school administrators, business. She wants to include rural, urban and suburban districts, and at least some of those districts should reflect `` the racial and ethnic makeup of our country.'' Another issue expected to spur debate at both teacher conventions is the tracking of students into classes for students with high, middle and low abilities. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> has been sharply critical of tracking, which some researchers say does little good for kids at the top and harms the kids at the bottom. A proposed NEA resolution says: `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> believes that the use of discriminatory academic tracking based on socioeconomic status, race, or sex must be eliminated in all public school settings. The Association urges its affiliates to oppose these practices.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> indicated she will ask her delegates to authorize a major study over the next year of tracking and ways to devise less discriminatory alternatives. It remains a thorny issue. `` I think it's very political,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said. `` We have to be honest. In some school districts, in order to hold on to the middle class white students, you needed to set up the Advanced Placement or high level classes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s membership has grown in the past year to more than 1.9 million _ including about 1.5 million public school teachers _ while the AFT has 665,000 members, including about 450,000 teachers. There are more than 2.3 million teachers in public schools; roughly 15 percent belong to neither union. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> is entering her sixth and final year as <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> is running unopposed for re-election as head of <ORGANIZATION> AFT </ORGANIZATION>, a post he has held since 1974.

<HEAD>Major Issues of Communist Party Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No specific agenda has been announced for the 19th Communist Party Conference, but delegates may consider a wide range issues put before them by the policy-making Central Committee or by speakers recognized by the conference leadership. Whether specific recommendations emerge from the debate could provide an indication of whether <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or more conservative forces among the delegates control the conference. The conference starts Tuesday and is now expected to last at least four days. Among the matters likely to be raised: THE PARTY'S ROLE _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said he wants to get party workers out of the hair of state and industry managers. The party, he said, should focus on political and ideological work, rather than try to rule every aspect of Soviet life. STALINISM _ The conference will play a role in the effort to come to terms with the legacy of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ran the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with an iron hand for nearly 30 years. Part of that legacy has been a cult of personality, now condemned. He also developed the `` command'' economcy, with all decisions made in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and passed down to individual factories and farms. PARTY CONTROL _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform-minded followers may press for new rules to limit party officials to two five-year terms and could set a mandatory retirement age, perhaps 75. The move would shake up the entrenched party bureaucracy that is seen as an obstacle to reform and enable <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to bring in new blood to help press his modernization program known as `` perestroika,'' or restructuring. Expansion of multi-candidate elections, conducted by secret ballot, to all party offices up to the 300-plus members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is another proposal. OFFICIAL POWERS _ An overhaul of the legal system to protect individual rights and insulate the system from political pressure is among the topics up for discussion. There also are proposals for some form of separation of powers, making the Supreme Soviet, now largely a rubber-stamp parliament that follows the will of the party, an independent, representative legislature. ECONOMY _ Under increasing pressure to show some tangible results of `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could ask the conference to recommend changes in economic policy, particularly in agriculture, where Soviet officials say permitting families to lease farms from their collectives could produce a dramatic increase in the nation's food supply, a constant subject of consumer complaints

 Stocks surged on news of a strengthened dollar, positive economic reports and eased pressure on interest rates, boosting the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks to the highest level since the crash eight months ago. The catalyst for Wednesday's rally appeared to be a surprising surge in the dollar, which rose to nearly 129 Japanese yen. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.03 points to 2,152.20. Bonds, meanwhile, rose as much as $ 18 for every $ 1,000 of face value, with interest rates on the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond dropping to 8.91 percent from 9.08 percent late Tuesday.

But gasoline prices, which also had rallied on Tuesday, moved higher and supported oil prices, he said. Gas futures rose on fears that supplies would be tight, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. Traders were concerned about the backup of gasoline barges on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, especially with the summer driving season at hand. The drought in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> has shrunk water levels on rivers and many barges have either run aground or become snagged in traffic bottlenecks. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> is running dredging operations to allow the barges to move, but progress has been slow.

<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> has teamed up for the first time with an ensemble of stars from the `` M-A-S-H'' television series in some new advertising for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> commercial in which <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> and other ex-M-A-S-H performers pose as workers in the same office has been completed and should be appearing on national television soon, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Wednesday Print versions of the ad also are being prepared. In the spring of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rounded up about a half-dozen actors who had appeared in the popular television series including <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Swit </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghoff </PERSON> and had them pose as office workers in commercials for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s new family of Personal System-2 computers. <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Hawkeye </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in the long-running `` M-A-S-H'' series, was conspicuously absent from that crew, reportedly because he still was under contract to another computer company, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In mid-February, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it had signed <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> to a multi-year contract to appear in commercials. Initially, he was used alone in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> ads. In one new commercial, which was shown to industry analysts and the media on Monday at a briefing where <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a new line of mid-range computers, <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> are shown walking into a stark office to have a chat. A small plant can been seen in the hallway. As the commercial progresses, sequential scenes are shown in which more and more people including <PERSON> Swit </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burghoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> show up for sessions which are described as a pow-wow, then a meeting and finally a conference. The plant in the hallway is bigger in each scene. A small computer shows up in the second scene, and bigger models turn up in subsequent scenes. The message is that the organization is getting bigger, and the new family of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mid-range computers is helping the business grow. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohsann </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the ensemble ad was shot in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at the end of May. He said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is trying to schedule the new ads with the television networks and did n't know precisely when they would air.

<HEAD>Pepsico Agrees to Buy Grand Met Bottling Operations for $705
Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 705 million in cash for the soft drink bottling operations of <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest independent bottler of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products. The deal, disclosed Wednesday, is expected to be completed by late July and involves territories in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calfornia </LOCATION>. Grand Metropolitan acquired the operations in 1980. They account for about 3.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic soft drink volume. But the <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, N.J.-based concern said the bottling operations did not fit its strategic business plan for developing its core businesses, which include hotels, retailing, foods and alcoholic beverages. `` Although <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is a leader in the soft drinks industry, we do not own the brand and therefore can not direct its position in the marketplace as we do our other brands like Smirnoff, Inter-Continental and Alpo,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman of Grand Metropolitan. The operations being sold are <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, that holds <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> franchises in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION>, which has franchises in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Grand Met said the companies had combined annual sales of $ 355 million in the year ended Sept. 30, 1987. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive, said the Grand Met franchises will `` significantly strengthen our soft drink volumes and improve operating profits, both this year and well into the future.'' He said the acquisition will dilute <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for 1988 by about 4 cents a share. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 595 million, or $ 2.26 a share, on revenue of $ 11.5 billion. The sale would mean <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, will own bottling operations that account for about 36 percent of its domestic soft drink volume, up from about 32.4 percent. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> was not looking to acquire independent bottling operations but became interested once the bottlers became available because they are located in `` two very important areas where we are determined to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s presence'' and in some cases border territories <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> already owns. He said such acquisitions offer `` some economies of scale.'' A spokeswoman for Grand Met, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, said her company was approached about three months ago by someone who suggested he may be prepared to offer a certain price for the bottling operations. She refused to identify the suitor. She said the inquiry prompted the company to consider whether it wanted to sell the operations, and it subsequently notifified a limited number of potential bidders that the operations were for sale. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> offered `` a very fair price.'' Grand Metropolitan is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a multinational company based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. Sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exceed $ 10 billion, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> has operations in soft drinks, snack foods and restaurants.

<HEAD>Brazil Gets $5.8 Billion Debt Refinancing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The debt restructuring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> reached with its creditor banks after eight months of tense negotiations includes $ 5.2 billion in new loans, lower interest rates and payments aimed at bringing the nation current on its obligations. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Wednesday said it had closed a $ 5.8 billion accord with its creditor banks to refinance some $ 64 billion of the country's massive foreign debt. The agreement ends <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s negotiations with the committee of 14 banks representing the nation's 700 creditor banks, which now must sign the accord. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has concluded one of the best refinancing accords ever reached by a debtor nation,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference. `` The accord is not a solution to the country's foreign debt problems but it will bring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> closer to the international financial community and remove the obstacles to economic and social development of the country,'' he said. The accord came a year and a half after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> stopped interest payments on the $ 64 billion in bank debt in order to conserve shrinking foreign reserves. The nation's total foreign debt of $ 121 billion is the largest in the developing world. While interest payments were a crippling $ 1 billion monthly, inflation soared to 1,000 percent annual levels, money reserves and the trade surplus dropped dramatically and unemployment skyrocketed to about 25 percent. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will make a $ 345 million payment to creditors for March interest on Friday and by the end of next month will meet a $ 1 billion to cover April and May interest, bringing it current on its obligations. But <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said the agreement did not `` formally revoke'' the moratorium. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said that might happen in October, when all creditors are expected to have signed the accord and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> receives more than $ 4 billion. Under the agreement, which covers interest due in 1987, 1988 and the first half of 1989, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will receive $ 5.2 billion in new money to meet interest payemtns and debt falling due over the period will be spread out over 20 years, with an eight-year grace period. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> also will receive $ 600 million in short-term credit lines toward financing exports and imports. In addition, the banks agreed to sharply reduce the interest rate they had been charging on the $ 64 billion in loans. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s spread, or the extra interest charged high-risk clients above the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION>, was to be cut to 0.8125 percent from the 1.75 percent set under previous agreements Among developing nations, only <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has obtained such a low spread from creditors. One of the sticking points between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and its creditors was linkage between new money and approval of the country's economic policies from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has argued the fund's policies are recessionary and impinge upon the country's sovereignty According to the accord, only the $ 600 million in credit lines will be linked to meeting economic goals in an IMF-approved plan and even that decision could be appealed at a later date. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is the first country to sign a medium-term accord without having to have any rigid links with the fund,'' <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> also is allowed to pull out of the agreement if there are any `` external economic shocks that impair <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s ability to meet interest payments.'' This could apply to even a drop in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s trade surplus, this year expected to reach over $ 13 billion.

 Officials of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s largest thrift say a federally-assisted takeover of a pair of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans is a chance to branch out in new directions. `` We had to diversify ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any time a bank has all its eggs in one basket, it can get in trouble. Our long-term objective is to have 20 percent of our bank in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 20 percent in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the balance in other places.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials guaranteed $ 83.9 million in assistance for <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan to absorb <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Brownfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownfield </LOCATION>. The transaction announced Wednesday was part of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION>, a federally-funded plan to recapitalize and consolidate ailing thrifts. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> officials still do not know how much in outstanding loans they will have to write off, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> division. He said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts' loan portfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inherited from the ailing thrifts. `` This acquisition ... was a little unusual in what we agreed to do with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> without lots of information,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, the largest thrift in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and 25th largest in the country, has $ 6.4 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, which already has seven branches in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is contributing $ 8.8 million in new capital to the deal to acquire <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 330 million in assets, and <LOCATION> Brownfield </LOCATION>, with $ 40 million. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift later this year as part of the transaction. It is forming a separate subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, to hold the three <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions. Bank board officials said they expect <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> to consolidate all its operations in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> within six to nine months. The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits up to $ 100,000, will hold warrants for 20 percent of the subsidiary's stock, officials said. First Financial and <PERSON> Brownfield </PERSON> are the ninth and 10th savings and loan cases resolved by federal regulators in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> this year, while 40 nationwide have been resolved. The state's institutions, hard hit by slumps in the oil industry and real estate valuations, accounted for $ 3 billion of the industry's $ 3.8 billion loss in the first three months of this year. Regulators say 133 of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 279 thrifts are insolvent under generally accepted accounting rules. The bank board hopes to reduce the number of savings and loans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by about 150 this year. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>'s expansion in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` will benefit <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the thrift industry and <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' The third thrift to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, would create a deal worth about $ 1 billion, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. Thrift industry officials said a $ 1.2 billion loss at <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> boosted losses by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' savings and loans to $ 3.5 billion during the first three months of 1988. Operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five states served by the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office of the bank board widened during the first quarter of 1988 to $ 1.1 billion from $ 623 million in 1987. Non-operating losses, primarily funds set aside to cover non-performing assets, increased to $ 2.8 billion from $ 609 million.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company is helping <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> solve its part of the national problem of what to do with the millions of discarded tires littering the landscape. The company plans to shred 3 million of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>'s 4 million junked tires and send them to a company in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for industrial fuel. The tires are stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Frasier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> yard, which has been identified as a breeding ground for the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> tiger mosquito, a suspected carrier of deadly dengue fever and encephalitis. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> is paying <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 538,000 to shred the tires into the size of charcoal briquets. <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> said it is selling the shreds to <ORGANIZATION> Titan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, which will use them to fuel a cement plant. `` They actually have produced more -LRB- heat energy -RRB- than the same amount of coal,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayly </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said of companies using the fuel. <PERSON> Bayly </PERSON> said the tires ca n't be burned here because local incinerators and boilers are n't designed to handle them without discharging particulates that would add to air pollution. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> LaDue </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION>, said the company could shred about 1,000 tires an hour with one machine. It hopes to have about half the tires in the 17-acre dump shredded by the first week in September and be finished by mid-October. The city contract gives the company nine months to do the job. The city and dump owner <PERSON> Murvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> have been in court since the city sued him in early 1986 over the tire dump. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Frasier </PERSON> gave <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> the right to shred and remove the tires. Some of the tires in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> were imported from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> by recapping companies, which junked them when they proved unusable. It was in such tires that the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> mosquito found its way to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, health officials say. In addition to the mosquito danger, the mountains of dumped tires are a major fire hazard that virtually are impossible to extinguish once ignited, <PERSON> Bayly </PERSON> said. Other ideas are in the works to handle the estimated 2 billion discarded tires littering landscapes throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an amount the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says is increasing by 250 million annually. <PERSON> Bayly </PERSON> said a number of companies are working on incinerators that will burn tires without pollution, while producing carbon black and oil as end products. According to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaDue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has the largest single tire dump in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with an estimated 8 million tires. <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> also will be bidding to rid <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> of its rubber mountain, he said. <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> began operations in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> last year as a subsidiary of Integrated Waste Systems. Sales manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the company has a state permit to shred 10,000 tires a day at its Buffalo plant and is using a shredder at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to reduce a pile of 200,000 to 300,000 tires. He said the chips can be an environmentally sound fuel alternative, given the proper type of power plant. `` We're looking to burn it with coal on a basis that would eliminate any smoke or fumes from going into the air,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. Companies that use it for fuel, he said, would have the proper scrubbing systems and stacks.

<HEAD>Alaska Governor Calls for Increased Federal Taxes on Gasoline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should substantially increase automotive fuel taxes to curb the flow at the nation's gas pumps and reduce imports of foreign oil. `` This is widely regarded as a politically unpopular proposal,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for the 29-state commission, meeting in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Nevertheless, it is probably the most effective way to reduce dependence on oil at the gas pumps.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> was sworn in Wednesday as the 1988-89 commission chairman, replacing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>. The commission was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 52 years ago to promote development of oil and gas reserves. In his speech, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> warned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must reduce its dependence on foreign oil. In 1983 the nation imported two million barrels of foreign oil a day. By May 1987 that figure had doubled to four million barrels. `` Last month we were averaging 5.5 million barrels of imports a day,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` If that supply is cut off, we will be faced with an economy-crippling price spike in oil,'' he said. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> blamed low prices for some of the problem. `` The current abundance of relatively cheap oil encourages this trend.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> also blamed the lack of energy conservation efforts for the increasing demand. Revenue from increased federal taxes on gasoline could be used to attack both problems, he said. `` The proceeds would be used to promote research in alternative fuels _ ranging from natural gas to grain alcohol fuels _ and to promote research into other conservation programs,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. He did not propose a specific tax hike other than to call for a `` substantial increase.'' An increase of 1 cent per gallon would yield $ 1 billion a year for the federal treasury and a 25-cent tax increase would generate $ 25 billion, he said. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> was less enthusiastic about an import tariff on foreign oil as a means of boosting the price of domestic supplies and reducing imports. Tariff-induced prices would be artificial, he said, and could hurt the economy more than they would help reduce dependence on foreign oil.

 While the federal <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to make employers take back terminated pension plans, it has n't proven it's case yet against <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a judge has ruled. The judge on Wednesday refused to uphold the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to force the financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> to reassume $ 2 billion in pension obligations because a new labor contract restored previously cut benefits. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said the agency, which insures the pensions of 30 million American workers, had not explored `` all the relevant facts'' before handing three underfunded pension plans back to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s Cleveland-based steel unit, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Since the agency's decision is not sustainable on the administrative record, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the restoration decision'' that gave back responsibility for the pensions to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, said Sweet. `` We're very pleased,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who called the ruling `` a complete victory.'' But Sweet concluded in his 126-page opinion that the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> might be able to make its case with additional data. The judge sent the issue back to the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> `` for further consideration'' and told both sides to arrange a conference with him on further proceedings. `` While the court recognized <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to restore terminated plans, it did not immediately enforce restoration of the <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> plans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoden </PERSON>. `` Instead, the court required additional fact finding by the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to fund the plans. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> is pleased that the court recognized our authority to restore plans, but we are disappointed that the court required additional proceedings.'' Reading from a statement, she said the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> `` is now considering other legal steps to resolve the issues of this case and relieve the uncertainty faced by retirees.'' The Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, a giant steel, aerospace and energy concern, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code in July 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures pension benefits much like the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> insures bank deposits, took over <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s steel industry pension plans last January after the company terminated them The plans were $ 2 billion in debt, making the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditor. But when a new <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> labor contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> restored some benefits previously cut, the agency claimed that the company was taking unfair advantage of federal funds to cut costs and gain labor peace. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, claims that restoring the plans and their deficit will seriously hamper its ability to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s first quarter net income rose 26 percent, according to the company, because of higher steel prices and the continuing benefits of federal bankruptcy law protection. Last September the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> shifted responsibility for the underfunded pension plans back to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, claiming the corporation was abusing the pension insurance program and its actions could jeopardize the agency's already strapped nationwide pension insurance fund. But <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> claimed the move violated the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, which bars legal action against companies in reorganization. Sweet ruled, however, that the restoration of pension plans was allowed under the law that created the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> and the action was not subject to the automatic stay provision.

UPDATE with government revising 1988 economic growth estimate.

<TEXT>
 The nation's economy, fueled by an export-driven manufacturing boom, expanded at a robust 3.6 percent in the first quarter, slightly less than previously thought, the government said today. Meanwhile, the government revised upwards its estimate of economic growth in 1988, predicting an expansion of 3.5 percent. The original predictions was that the economy would grow by 2.9 percent this year. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The economy is doing better than even we expected. Our rosy forecast was n't rosy enough.'' He said that contrary to some fears, the economy is not overheating, with inflation holding at 4.3 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 3.915 trillion in the January-March period, a $ 34.6 billion increase from three months earlier. It was a modest downward revision of a previous estimate of GNP growth in the first quarter. Last month, the government put GNP growth at 3.9 percent, up from an initial estimate of 2.3 percent in April. Analysts were expecting the slight retreat. Government economists said the first quarter growth occurred with little pickup in inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, slightly lower than the previously estimated 1.7 percent and well below the 2.7 percent pace of the fourth quarter. In a separate report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax corporate profits fell 1.0 percent in the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 144.2 billion. That was down $ 1.4 billion from the last three months of 1987 and the worst performance since the first quarter of 1987, when profits fell 3.7 percent. Today's report represents a downward revision from an estimate last month, when the department said profits after taxes eased up 0.5 percent. On Wednesday, a strong rally by the dollar and indications that inflation may not be heating up as badly as earlier feared helped spark a stock market rally that pushed Wall Street to its highest levels since the October crash. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 43.03 points to 2,152.20, eclipsing the previous post-crash high of 2,131.40 set a week earlier. Aiding the market was the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 2.2 percent decline in May of orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods, the biggest drop in nine months. Economists said the decline in orders was healthy because it indicated the economy was not being overheated by too much pressure on production capacity. Stocks also were helped by a big rise by the dollar in foreign exchange, a rally that caught many traders by surprise. The dollar reached almost 129 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up more than 2 yen from Tuesday's close. Analysts said the dollar's jump may have stemmed partly from the outcome of the economic summit meeting of the seven major industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and a summit communique hinting there was room for the dollar to strengthen further. `` That statement gave the market a signal to buy dollars,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The decline in durable goods orders surprised economists, who had expected more than a 2 percent rise in orders. But they noted the government's survey apparently did not include several multibillion-dollar orders placed to Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Even though the overall May decline was the largest since August's 2.3 percent fall, analysts saw little cause to worry that the report was forecasting a significant decline in manufacturing, which has been booming as the cheaper dollar bolsters export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. Excluding defense goods, orders fell only 0.9 percent. Excluding airplanes, they rose 0.6 percent. The financial markets read the report as good news for inflation. Many traders and some analysts have been concerned that the export boom, coupled with steady consumer demand in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would strain manufacturers' capacity and cause shortages and price increases.

<HEAD>Expansion Still Robust Though Down Slightly From Last Estimate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, fueled by an export-driven manufacturing boom, expanded at a robust 3.6 percent pace in the first three months of this year, slightly less than previously thought, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 3.915 trillion in the January-March period, a $ 34.6 billion increase from three months earlier. Strong first quarter growth has prompted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to boost its 1988 projection for GNP growth to 3.5 percent. At the start of the year, the administration had predicted the economy would grow 2.9 percent in 1988, the same rate of growth as in 1986 and 1987. At the time, many private economists were more pessimistic, but they have since scrambled to increase their predictions. `` Our rosy forecast was n't rosy enough,'' said <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The economy is doing better than even we expected.'' The latest first quarter numbers were a modest downward revision of a previous estimate of GNP growth in the first quarter. A month ago, the government put GNP growth at 3.9 percent. However, in April, the initial estimate was a much lower 2.3 percent. Many analysts were expecting the slight retreat. Today's revisions show that non-military spending by the federal government was $ 3.8 billion less than previously thought. Most of that was accounted for by a dip in purchases of surplus farm commodities. Consumer spending, although up a moderately strong 3.8 percent, was weaker than the previously estimated 4.3 percent growth. Much of that was due to somewhat less automobile buying than first thought. Immediately after the October stock market crash, many economists feared the shock to consumer confidence would topple the country into a recession. Consumer spending did post a rare 2.5 percent decline in the fourth quarter, but it has come back in the first three months of this year. The engines driving the six-year-old economic expansion now, even more than consumer spending, are rising export sales spurred by the cheaper dollar and the consequent surge in modernization and expansion spending by businesses. Exports of goods and services were up a strong 22.8 percent in the first quarter. Business investment in capital equipment shot up 33.1 percent, the fastest rise since the first year of the recovery from the 1981-82 recession. The growth has buried fears of another recession, but now financial markets have become concerned that the economy is expanding so rapidly that it will rekindle inflation. First quarter growth was occurring with little pickup in inflation, however. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, slightly lower than the previously estimated 1.7 percent and well below the 2.7 percent pace of the fourth quarter. But, some analysts say inflationary pressures have begun to surface in the quarter ending this month. In a second report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations' after-tax profits fell 1.0 percent in the first quarter, the poorest showing since profits dipped 3.7 percent in the first quarter of 1987. Last month, the government, in a preliminary estimate, said profits eased up a slight 0.5 percent in the January-March period. Profits were up a moderate 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists say lagging profits could put pressure on businesses to raise prices. The GNP in the fourth quarter of 1987 was even stronger, growing at a 4.8 percent annual rate. However, much of that production went into a rapid buildup in inventories of goods held on shelves and back lots. The mix of growth in the January-March period is considered better, but the worry now is that too much demand _ from American consumers as well as from overseas buyers _ will strain factory capacity, causing shortages and driving up prices. With the second quarter of 1988 drawing to a close, the signals are mixed. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is running at a 4.4 percent annual rate through May, the same as last year. But drought-spared food price increases have yet to show up at the retail level. And factory operating rates have risen from 82.4 percent of capacity in March to 82.9 percent in May, creeping closer to the 85 percent level that economists consider clearly inflationary. On the plus side, consumer demand seems to be cooling enough to allow more room for production of exports and business equipment. Retail sales grew only a lackluster 0.1 percent in May after a 0.4 percent decline in April. Most economists are projecting slightly weaker, but not weak, economic growth in the second quarter. `` I would see some modest slowing in the second quarter as businesses trim down their inventories, but there's too much pep in the economy for there to be a major slowdown until later in the year,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Thursday that it is under investigation for possible securities law violations, but a spokesman for the company denied any wrongdoing. According to the spokesman, the focus of the investigation appears to relate to the disposition of a portion of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s stock position in <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> during late 1986. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> made a hostile bid for Carbide in 1985 but reached a standstill agreement with the company the following year. According to unidentified sources quoted in Thursday's editions of the Wall Street Journal, the federal government is looking into <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s accumulation of Carbide stock through <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> securities firm once headed by <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>. Jefferies pleaded guilty to two felonies after being implicated in a stock parking scheme by convicted arbitrager <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is now serving time in prison. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chairman and chief administrative officer, has been named as having had an agreement with <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> regarding alleged stock parking and manipulation, the newspaper said. Under their alleged agreement, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reimburse the Jefferies firm for losses incurred in trading in Carbide stock. The Journal's sources noted that <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> did not make any money from the scheme. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> appears undecided as to whether it will seek criminal charges in the case, the paper said. `` Both the company and its officials are innocent of any wrongdoing,'' a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said. In early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> had fallen $ 1.62 -LCB- a share to $ 46 -LCB-.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Soar At Opening</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened sharply higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid fears that crop damage from the scorching drought was bound to deepen. Soybeans for July delivery blasted to a 15-year high in early trading after topping $ 10.76 -LCB- a bushel, the 1977 top price for a near-month contract. Scattered rain fell in parts of the eastern Farm Belt Wednesday but analysts said only a return to normal rainfall patterns could ward off further wreckage in the country's corn, oat, spring wheat and soybean fields. Experts estimate the drought has already devastated at least 50 percent of the oat and spring wheat crops, 30 percent of corn and will begin to take a significant toll on soybeans in July. Corn for July delivery opened up the 10-cents-a bushel limit; July soybeans quickly traded up their 45-cent limit, putting the contract within -LCB- cent of $ 11 a bushel; and oat futures opened limit-up. Weekend weather forecasts for more light, scattered showers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> may have a slight slowing effect on the rally, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I would say the market is going to remain strong, although some profit-taking may come in today and tomorrow,'' she said. In early trading, wheat was 7 cents to 11 cents higher with July at $ 3.92 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 3.54 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 14 -RCB- cents to 15 cents higher with July at a record $ 3.48 a bushel; soybeans were 21 cents to 45 cents higher with July at $ 10.99 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower to limit-down in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .42 cent to 1.20 cents lower with August at 62.12 a pound; feeder cattle were 1.15 cents to the limit 1.50 cents lower with August at 69.15 cents a pound; hogs were the limit 1.50 cents lower to .05 cent higher with July at 44.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with July at 40 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures closed sharply lower Wednesday.

 Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> has agreed to sharply reduce his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION>, ending a lengthy takeover battle for <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company, sources said Thursday. Under terms of a settlement, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> will sell part of his 45 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, a French banking company that, along with its allies, holds a slim majority. The sale will reduce <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s holdings to about 15 percent, thereby blocking his ability to manipulate decisions that require a 75 percent vote of shareholders. In return, however, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> would get a cash payment, at least three seats on <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s board and would increase his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The agreement is expected to be formally announced Friday at a news conference called by <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, whose holdings in industries including energy, finance, chemicals, mining and transport control about a third of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s economy. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> announced in January he sought to control <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. The Belgian company resisted his overtures but had to look for foreign support in <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, which along with the Belgian insurer <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> came to control slightly more than 50 percent of the holdign company's shares. At a special meeting two months ago, shareholders spurned <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to win board seats for himself and two allies. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>'s strengthened stake under the settlement should allow the French group to run <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> with its own new chief executive, reorganizing the company's often criticized strategy as well as its management structure. A statement issued earlier this week confirming negotiations were underway said <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and its allies will back the nomination of <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmoy </PERSON>, a French banker, to <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s board, while <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and his allies will abstain. It is expected that <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmoy </PERSON> will be asked to take over a large part of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s management. The French-Belgian group was also reported to be interested in looking for more foreign partners, including the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> media magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. Under the agreement between <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, Belgians' stake in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> will decline substantially, according to Belgian press reports The conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> wrote: `` The decision center has moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today voted to levy the first fine for violation of its new decency standards on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> television station that aired a sexy movie during prime time. Commissioners voted 2-1 to impose the maximum $ 2,000 fine against KZKC-TV for its May 1987 broadcast of `` Private Lessons,'' which included scenes of a bare-breasted woman seducing a teen-ager. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> station aired the movie at 8 p.m., a time the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has determined children are likely to be in the audience. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines allow `` indecent'' material to be aired after midnight to lessen the risk that such programs could be viewed by children. Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, who represents the station, said he was `` shocked and surprised and outraged by the imposition of the maximum fine in light of the circumstances.'' He said the sanction is unfair because `` we do n't know what is indecent because the statute does n't provide any guidance.'' All three commissioners said that the movie fit the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of indecency, but Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> disagreed with the fine She said `` parents, not the commission, should bear the primary responsibility of deciding what their children should watch at night.'' <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> disagreed, saying the government must help parents in deciding what their children watch on television. He said it is reasonable to assume that there are unsupervised children in the audience during prime-time hours. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s record on indecency has been clear. `` While respecting the First Amendment rights of all citizens, we have taken clear and decisive action to enforce the statutory ban on broadcast obscenity and to further restrict the broadcast of indecent material so as to put parents in a better position to control their children's access to this type of material,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> KZKC </ORGANIZATION>, has said the film had been cut by an inexperienced editor and violated company standards, but a fine would be inappropriate because the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s indecency guidelines are ambiguous and are being applied to TV for the first time. The movie, the owners said, was aired little more than a month after the new standards were adopted. The FCC guidelines are being challenged in court by broadcasting groups, news organizations and public interest advocates as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Media Central acknowledged that the airing of the 1980 sex comedy violated <ORGANIZATION> KZKC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` broadcast standards and sense of good taste,'' but the company said station officials took immediate corrective action after the broadcast, including a clarification of the station's policy on frontal nudity. Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be premature to comment before the commission acted. Media Central, based in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is awaiting court action on a reorganization plan it filed under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. `` Private Lessons'' is about a wealthy 15-year-old boy who is seduced by his housekeeper. The film includes several scenes in which the housekeeper is shown bare-breasted. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> decided in April 1987 to apply the wording of a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that said indecent material is `` language or material that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.'' The commission said indecent material may be aired only when there is a reasonable risk that children are not in the audience. In a subsequent ruling in November 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider that children were not likely to be in the audience after midnight. Previously the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had considered 10 p.m. the cutoff time.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today predicted that the economy will grow at a larger-than-expected 3.5 percent rate in 1988 and that inflation will hold steady at 4.3 percent, with the odds overwhelming against a recession. A slight increase in interest rates, about a half percent, was forecast for the year. In revising earlier estimates, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Our rosy forecast was n't rosy enough. `` The economy is doing better than even we expected.'' The administration originally had predicted the economy would grow by 2.9 percent this year. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, responding to a reporter's question at a picture-taking session with visiting Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, said he was not worried about a new round of inflation `` and I do n't think we should.'' `` All the evidence shows us that our recovery is going on and, no, there is no great threat of inflation,'' the president said. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said the drought could have `` a significant effect on food prices'' unless there is rain soon. However, he said the farm community generates only about two percent of the Gross National Product, the broadest gauge of economic health. Asked about the administration's new projections, private economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> agreed with the upward revision in the economic growth prediction but disagreed with the inflation estimate. `` He's certainly right about better growth, ... but the rest is just pie in the sky stuff,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private economic consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're not going to have double-digit inflation, but a reasonable private sector forecast of consumer inflation would be 5 to 5.5 percent,'' he said. `` Nobody can be faulted for not forecasting the drought ahead of time, but now that it has occurred you have to make some upward revisions because of it.'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> released his new estimates at a White House briefing. Asked if the figures mean there is no chance of a recession, <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said, `` I would n't say it's zero danger. Anything can happen. `` But it's our view the overwhelming odds suggest that the economy will continue to expand on average this year even though at a more moderate pace than was evident in the first quarter,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said. He said that, contrary to some fears, the economy is not overheating. Moreover, he said, `` there is no sign of an upsurge in inflation.'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said the economic growth rate would slow somewhat over the last nine months of the year from its first-quarter pace. He said growth projections for 1989 and beyond were being revised downward slightly to offset the upward revision for 1988 and the stronger-than-expected growth experienced during 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 For 1989, the administration expects the economy to grow 3.1 percent. Economic growth is measured two ways, on an annual basis and on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. The 3.5 percent 1988 growth forecast is for year-to-year change. Using the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter comparison, the administration predicted the economy will grow at a 3 percent rate, compared iwith the earlier estimate of 2.4 percent. In revising the figures, <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> noted that the economy had expanded faster than expected in the first three months of the year, 3.6 percent. `` We do expect slower growth over the remainder of the year,'' he said. The inflation estimate, as measured by the consumer price index, is still 4.3 percent, the same as originally predicted on a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis, <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said. The estimate for interest rates was revisd upward about a half percent. As measured by rates for 91-day <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, inflation was estimated at 6 percent, compared with a 5.3 percent rate forecast earlier. Measured on the basis of rates for 10-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, the rate was forecast at 8.5 percent, compared with 8 percent predicted earlier.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 `` For those of you who are always trying to figure out what we are thinking, it means we envision some decline in interest rates later this year, as the economy's growth rate slows from the rapid first quarter rate and inflation continues to abate,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said. The forecast unemployment rate was slightly lower than originally estimated, 5.5 percent for the year now as compared with an earlier projection of 5.8 percent.

 A top <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official whose phone was tapped in the massive Pentagon bribery probe has begun cooperating with prosecutors, while a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said today that others are following suit. Deputy Assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, whose office was searched last week, has begun telling prosecutors what he knows, sources familiar with the investigation said. One <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said today that `` there has been some interest shown on the part of some individuals in cooperating with the investigation.'' He said that some information `` has already been obtained.'' Other sources familiar with the probe said the interest was coming from subjects who are working in the Pentagon. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters he has arranged for a report on the present status of the investigation, but did not say how soon he expects to receive it. Responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visiting Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> today, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I am asking, and have arranged - they are coming over to give me a full report.'' He said the report would deal with the question of `` where are we now and how much do we know already?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that investigators believe <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> was a principal supplier of Pentagon documents to defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who was assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' boss until April 1987. The Times, quoting government sources, said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> allegedly arranged an elaborate scheme under which high-level <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials smuggled classified documents out of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and allowed him to copy them with the aid of his wife. The newspaper said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> allegedly passed the sensitive information to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had retained him as a consultant shortly after he left his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post. One source told the Times that <PERSON> Paisely </PERSON> received `` staggering fees'' from the company. The 2-year-old investigation focuses on allegations that private consultants, many of them former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, paid bribes to obtain <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> secrets about upcoming contracts. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> made an appointment to hire a <LOCATION> Washington-area </LOCATION> defense lawyer, but then abruptly canceled the meeting after getting a call from a federal investigator who told him that `` you have until 9 a.m. tomorrow to decide whose side you're on,'' according to one source. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> decided several days ago to cooperate, said the sources. While <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is talking with prosecutors, another <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official whose office was searched, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, is negotiating with the government on whether to do the same, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. After a meeting with the chief prosecutor in the probe, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> said `` people will really be shocked'' by the scale of wrongdoing involved. `` It appears they have very good evidence,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said after being briefed by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for eastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> had key procurement jobs in the Pentagon. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> was deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for acquisition management while <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was a top deputy to the deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control, communications and computer systems. Both men have been reassigned since the investigation became public. While <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was describing the case to congressional leaders on Wednesday, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> was defending his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> management style and warning against public and congressional overreaction to the disclosures. `` No matter how careful you are, you're not going to be able to eliminate dishonesty,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told congressional leaders in closed meetings that 75 to 100 contracts worth `` tens of billions of dollars'' are under scrutiny, according to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said after hearing <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> that `` these contracts may have to be examined to determine if they were in fact tainted by these allegations <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told reporters that there may not be any indictments until after the Nov. 8 election. `` I'm hopeful that if indictments are appropriate in the case, they will be secured by the end of the year,'' the prosecutor said. `` If we can proceed at a faster pace, we'll attempt to do it.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> also told lawmakers that no member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a target of the investigation so far, despite news leaks identifying several as under scrutiny. `` No subpoena has been sought for any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, no wiretap has been directed at any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and no search warrant has been directed at any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the investigation focuses primarily on the sale of inside information by private consultants who were acting as middlemen between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and defense contractors, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. In other developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday's editions that the investigation has spread to two dozen <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees and about 60 companies Citing sources that it did not identify, the newspaper said bribes ranging up to $ 50,000 had been paid to some government employees for sensitive contract information and proprietary industry data. _ <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, the 28-year-old daughter of a defense consultant under investigation and an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., was relieved on Wednesday of handling military issues for The congressman is one of five <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whose names have come up in the case. Ms. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> remains on <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s staff as a legislative assistant dealing with other issues. Ms. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was reassigned because she and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> agreed she would be in an `` untenable position'' if she continued to handle military matters because her father, defense consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, `` is a principal in the investigation,'' said a spokesman for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattaway </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the other four congressmen reported under scrutiny have all said they are not targets of the inquiry. The others are Reps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> procurement subcommittee; and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., a member of <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is also on the <LOCATION> Stratton </LOCATION> panel. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, one of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s closest friends and staunchest allies, complained that the case was prompting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public to lose sight of the continuing need for a strong defense. `` You do n't close a bank because there's been a bank robbery,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> awards 52,000 contracts every single day, and inevitably there may be some faithless or dishonest people.''

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were little changed Thursday amid some profit-taking and uncertainty over the market's direction. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 0.4 point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,878.9. Trading volume was 558.9 million shares, compared with 521.6 million shares Wednesday.

 Crews dredged the drought-shrunken <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> around the clock today to free hundreds of backed-up barges, while triple-digit temperatures prompted autoworkers to walk off the job after a co-worker collapsed and died. Sprinklings of rain Wednesday succeeded only in frustrating farm-belt growers, while thunderstorms across the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> earned a round of applause from baseball fans at Tiger Stadium in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> during a rain delay. `` With the searing heat we've had the situation has become very, very serious as our crops begin to deteriorate,'' said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s secretary of agriculture, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> `` In the next 10 days, if we do n't get rain we could lose 50 percent of our corn crop.'' A series of fierce thunderstorms ripped across southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> during the night, knocking down trees and causing power outages and at least two fires while as much as 2 inches of rain fell on parts of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Rain also fell in <LOCATION> Clyde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where Sioux Indian Chief <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON> had performed a rain ceremony he promised would bring rain by today. Florist <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Doebels </PERSON>, who brought Crow Dog to the northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> town, said he was n't sure if the chief deserved the credit for the showers. `` I'm not one to know those answers,'' he said. `` All I know is you flip a coin and sometimes it comes up heads.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> officials today increased the estimated acreage burned by fires on dried out land, saying a fire near the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> border had burned 5,600 acres while the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pines </LOCATION> fire to the south burned about 4,700 acres. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> firefighters dug in today around a wildfire burning out of control over 35 acres of heavily wooded mountainous area in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The fire was apparently sparked by lightning Wednesday afternoon. In <LOCATION> Fenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> autoworker died after collapsing Wednesday night in what co-workers said was unbearable heat in a paint shop, as temperatures in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area topped 100 degrees. Medical officials today said he died of a heart attack. `` It's so hot, you can hardly breathe in there. It's like you're smothering _ like you're inside an oven,'' said one worker, <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> `` Your skin is like someone poured baby oil on you.'' An autopsy today found that <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, 54, of <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON>, had severe coronary artery disease, said <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballwin </PERSON>. He said doctors in the medical examiner's office found no evidence that heat was a factor in <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s death. Shortly after he collapsed, hundreds of paint-shop workers at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 and 2 plants walked off their jobs because of the heat. The walkout, the second in two days, forced the assembly lines at both plants to shut down, but they were back in operation this morning, said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the buildings have no air conditioning but are ventilated and workers are given ice. Also Wednesday, the Coast Guard for the first time limited the number of barges towboats can push in a major portion of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The limits were sought by barge companies that want to prevent towboat operators from running their loads aground in record-low water. `` There's got to be a doomsday point out there somewhere. Right now, I do n't know anybody that I've talked to who can give me any idea where that is,'' said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, we are not on the brink of disaster.'' Under the limits, southbound towboats must have no more than 20 barges while northbound boats will be limited to 25, only 16 of which can be loaded, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON>. Authorities said the 24-hour dredging of the river near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, would take until Friday afternoon, and more than 1,200 barges, many recently freed from other backlogs, were expected to stack up. Crews on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> also worked to break bottlenecks. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, phosphorus leaking from a derailed tanker burst into flames in 99-degree heat late Wedesday, spreading a toxic cloud across five western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> counties and driving thousands from their homes. White phosphorus spontaneously burns when exposed to air temperatures above 85 or 90 degrees, said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> today with governors from drought-stricken states to advise a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on the crisis and the outlook for the nation. `` We'll need a little bit of time to determine what the losses are,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` But we will do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage.'' He said the federal government's response would include expansion of existing crop insurance and disaster loan programs. The day before, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a congressional drought task force, which urged him to take all steps in his power to provide relief. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, said the focus of immediate efforts is on assuring feed for livestock and that legislative action to deal with crop losses would be delayed until officials determine the extent of the damage. The record-setting heat wave continued to quicken the evaporation of moisture from the soil, but temperatures began to drop and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted some temporary relief today. A cold front moved through the Great Lakes region and the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> early today and should southward and toward the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, dropping temperatures into the 80s and 70s. The front was expected to bring scattered showers, but `` it does n't look like too much change in the situation or perhaps none at all,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> of the weather service in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. By midafternoon Wednesday, two dozen cities had set high-temperature records. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the temperature reached 100 degrees for the first time in more than 10 years. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials declared a heat emergency, opening up air conditioned buildings to the elderly.

<HEAD>Rowntree Agrees to $4.5 Billion Buyout From Nestle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday agreed to a sweetened, $ 4.5 billion buyout offer from Swiss foods giant <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, ending the months-long `` candy bar war'' for the British confectioner. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.55 billion-pound offer edges out rival bidder <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss chocolate and coffee concern, to create the world's second-largest confectioner behind <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The bid for <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>, maker of the Kit <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> candy bar, is the largest offer for a British company by a foreign concern. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> will pay 10.75 pounds a share, or $ 19.03, up from its initial bid of 2.1 billion pounds, or 890 pence a share. The confectioner increased its stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION> to 22 percent Thursday from a previous 15.8 percent. Suchard, which holds a 29.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, had offered 2.32 billion pounds, or 950 pence a share. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s bid not only is 13 percent higher than <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>'s offer, but <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> `` got the board along with the agreement, which is crucial in this takeover battle. That is probably enough to win Rowntree.'' <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> declined to comment on its plans, but <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderau </PERSON>, the company's vice president for corporate affairs, said, `` We are in no rush.'' But he said <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> is `` still convinced that <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> would be the ideal partner for us.'' Analysts predict <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>, which will drop from second to third place among worldwide confectioners, is likely to sell out to its rival. At the current buyout price, <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>'s profit would amount to about 205 million pounds, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. The battle for <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> began April 13 when Zurich-based Suchard, maker of the triangular Toblerone chocolate bar, snapped up nearly 15 percent of <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s shares in a `` dawn raid.'' That move prompted <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> to enter the fray with an initial offer on April 26. <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> countered with its bid a month later. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> closed up 37 pence a share at 10.76 pounds a share. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> said it assured <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> that the confectioner's <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters will remain the center of the company's activities in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and that the office also will serve as headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s international chocolate and confectionery `` strategy.'' In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> will be retained as an executive member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> general management committee. The assurances were an apparent attempt to fend off public criticism about the takeover. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said, `` We believe that the price now offered is fair and shareholders and employees should both gain from the agreement which has been reached.'' The competing bids by the two Swiss companies sparked a controversy in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where critics objected to the acquisition of the 263-year-old British company by a foreign concern and feared job losses in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Rowntree employs 5,300 of its 30,000 workers. The government's decision not to intervene in the takeover bids sparked protests and divided members of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a sad but inevitable result of the government's refusal to defend British industry against foreign predators,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a Quaker grocer's shop in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, had a pre-tax profit of 112 million pounds on sales of 1.43 billion pounds in 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, had net profit of 1.8 billion Swiss francs, or about $ 1.2 billion, on sales of 35.2 billion Swiss francs, or $ 24 billion last year. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Maucher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, said, `` We look forward to building on the strengths of the two companies and creating a prosperous future for the combined group.'' The previous largest foreign bid for a British company was Australia-based <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 purchase of the Courage brewing business from <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for 1.4 billion pounds, or $ 2.5 billion, according to Mergers and Acquisitions magazine.

<HEAD>Irving Fails To Act By Bank Of NY Deadline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> failed to respond by a Thursday deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for accepting a sweetened $ 1.4 billion takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the company was disappointed that no action had been taken, and as a result, the friendly offer had expired. In a one-page letter sent Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> outside director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the bank would be `` derelict in its duty if we tried to respond'' by the noon Thursday deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> said several serious concerns remained, among them, whether <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> could proceed with its latest offer under the conditional approval the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> granted to its previous $ 1.2 billion offer. That approval is scheduled to run out July 9. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors, which favors a merger with the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, failed to reach a decision after meeting for several hours on Tuesday. Company representatives also held a 1 -LCB- - hour meeting with <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> had plenty of time to respond. `` The offer was out there for 10 days,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> had warned that unless <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors went along with its latest proposal it would push for a quick court decision on related lawsuits and proceed with a hostile $ 1.1 billion tender offer. The company is seeking, among other things, to remove <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s anti-takeover `` poison pill.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> improved its offer last week by slightly raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder incentives, including a special cash dividend. It valued the revised bid for all of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million shares outstanding at around $ 76 a share, or $ 1.4 billion. That is about 25 percent higher than the existing hostile $ 1.1 billion tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank, is offering $ 80 a share for 51 percent of Irving, or about $ 760 million. The proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring plan that includes, among other things, sale of Irving assets, cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Mixed In Wild Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed in a wildly erratic session Thursday that saw soybeans hit a 15-year high near $ 11 a bushel, then plummet 70 cents as the market developed a feverish case of the jitters. `` We're trading hysteria right now,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We're seeing an unprecedented type of weather,'' she said. `` However, it's also a very well-known fact that there is significant downside risk if the weather situation were to change.'' The markets opened sharply higher on fears of deepening drought damage but only oat futures sustained the bullish momentum on reports estimating oat yield losses of at least 50 percent. Most oat contracts advanced the limit for daily trading for the fourth consecutive session. Soybean futures began falling sharply at around noon CDT after the price for July delivery reached $ 10.99 -LCB- a bushel. Corn and wheat followed suit. `` The quote machines could not keep up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said. `` I was seeing quotes on my machine 10 cents behind what the market was trading. I would not be compeletely shocked if we saw a record volume day today.'' At the close, wheat was 6 -LCB- cents lower to 5 cents higher with July at $ 3.80 a bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.48 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 15 cents higher with July at $ 3.48 a bushel; soybeans were 24 -LCB- cents lower to 20 cents higher with July at $ 10.30 a bushel.

 The stock market retreated slightly today in moderate trading, weakened by investors cashing profits from the strong gains of the previous two sessions. Some traders were disheartened by what they called the market's failure to sustain the momentum of a rally that began late Tuesday and carried over into Wednesday They said it reflected a reluctance by a broad range of investors to commit significant money to the market. But others were more optimistic and said the slight retreat should be regarded as a positive sign of underlying strength. `` The back-to-back days of the magnitude we had are probably some cause for some profit-taking,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldowney </PERSON>, head of equity and over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stringfellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I'm not at all discouraged by this.''

Some people even claimed to have facsimile machines at home _ about 1 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> survey found. `` Our products are not luxuries owned by a privileged, select few,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friel </PERSON>, vice president of the trade organization's <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said in a news conference Not surprisingly, the survey found the households with the highest incomes had the most consumer electronics products. But it was n't just rich singles. Ownership was higher among families with children. For example, about 78 percent of families with children had VCRs, while only 40 percent of single-member households did. In general, ownership of consumer electronics products was higher in the East and West than in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> or South. For example, telephone answering machines were in 36 percent of households in the West and 27 percent in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. They were in 19 percent of the households in the South and 17 percent of those in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the survey found. On televisions, the survey found that 31 percent of households owned one, 33 percent owned two and 35 percent owned three or more. Forty-three percent of households with children own three or more televisions. Questions asked of the whole group have a margin of error of 4 percentage points, while questions asked of subgroups have higher error margins, a Gallup spokesman said. Since it was a survey done by phone, the results are valid only for homes with telephones _ people without phones would tend to own less consumer electronics equipment.

 The dollar gyrated in world trading Thursday but managed to finish mostly higher on key markets, maintaining its recent gains amid profit - taking and rumors of central bank action to keep the currency in line Still, traders acknowledged that despite the recent rally, nothing fundamentally has changed to ensure a continued increase in the dollar's value. Gold prices eased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price of $ 447.90 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 448.80 late Wednesday. The dollar opened higher when the day's trading began in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> quickly began calling traders in an attempt to dampen their enthusiasm for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The dollar quickly retreated when traders learned the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> was unhappy with the currency's level and was monitoring the situation. When trading shifted to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, however, the dollar resumed its climb in an unusually volatile session. Dealers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said there was no apparent reason for the rise, although most concurred that positive sentiment following this week's economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and a positive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for April helped support the currency. Traders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> downplayed indications that the major industrialized democracies would tolerate a higher dollar. `` What is a slightly higher dollar?'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> asked rhetorically. `` If the dollar is nudged up, it will have to be slow and gradual. It's come up a bit too quickly over the past few trading days,'' he noted. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar did not have enough momentum to test the psychologically important levels of 130 Japanese yen and 1.80 West German marks. `` Generally in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> there was a lack of appetite to drive the dollar sharply higher,'' he said. `` To push it higher, we needed fundamental news, and we did n't have any.'' While the dollar was off for most of the domestic trading session, a late wave of buying by Australian and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> investors helped the currency finish mostly higher, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said that while the dollar may be headed higher in the long term, it is unlikely to test key levels on the upside until the release of the next set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, which could serve as a springboard for a further advance In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before the European day begins, the dollar rose 0.95 yen to close at 128.55 yen, up from Wednesday's 127.60 Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 128.70 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 128.62 yen, off slightly from 128.95 yen on Wednesday. The dollar gained against the British pound. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.7565, down from $ 1.7710 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.7552 to buy one pound, cheaper than Wednesday's $ 1.7658 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.7850 West German marks, up from 1.7818; 1.4763 Swiss francs, up from 1.4747; 6.0050 French francs, up from 6.0025, 1,323.88 Italian lire, up from 1,3202.75, and 1.2022 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2102. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.7855 West German marks, up from 1.7740; 1.4800 Swiss francs, up from 1.4720; 6.0245 French francs, up from 5.9747; 2.0145 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9975; 1,326.50 Italian lire, up from 1,314.50, and 1.2030 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2100. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, one troy ounce of gold bullion finished at $ 447.70, down from Wednesday's price of $ 449.50. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold rose to a late bid of $ 448.75 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 448.50. Gold finished at $ 448.50 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, unchanged from Wednesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.68 to close at a bid $ 449.78. Silver eased on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex to $ 6.967 a troy ounce, from $ 7.177 on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 7.02 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 7.06.

 Common Market leaders should remove obstacles to airline mergers by carriers based in different member nations, Western European aviation experts said Thursday at a seminar here. `` Far-reaching liberalization of the airline industry is essential to ensure a free flow of goods and services within the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Raben </PERSON>, head of the Dutch civil aviation agency, told a news conference. `` And it is crystal-clear that obstacles against international mergers must be removed.'' He spoke at the end of the day-long seminar in this southern Dutch town on the future of the airline industry in the deregulated, liberalized Common Market envisioned after 1992. The conference, convened by <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Neelie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smit-Kroes </PERSON>, drew 40 representatives from Common Market airlines, civil aviation authorities and governments. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has a 1992 goal of removing all trade barriers among its members, including <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s patchwork of bilateral aviation agreements Although some nations, notably <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, already have liberalized aviation agreements, most European countries severely limit the freedom of operation for foreign airlines. After 1992, European airlines would be free to choose their destinations and flight frequencies. Experts at the seminar predicted that only a few very large carriers will be able to survive. Seminar participants heard a report by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> on possible effects of European airline mergers on the flying public. The <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> commissioned the report by the private, Geneva-based organization. In the report, <ORGANIZATION> IFAPA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members should maintain some regulations to safeguard airline passengers. He said that after the 1978 deregulation of civil aviation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, passenger complaints on congestion, delays and bad service mushroomed. <PERSON> Raben </PERSON> said that while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government abolished many of the regulations affecting the airline industry in one move, `` we're planning a gradual change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The world's sudden enthusiasm for the dollar is built on the vicissitudes of guesswork and opinion, and it may not last. After months of stability, the dollar has jumped about 3 percent against the Japanese yen and 4 percent against the West German mark since June 10. Investors who used to treat the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency as a sick patient are speculating about how high it might rise. Many analysts are happy to explain why they believe the dollar's rise is long overdue and well-justified, but watertight explanations have proven notoriously leaky in the past Certainly there have been some reasonable theories for the increase in the dollar's value. For example: _ A sharp improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit for the month of April raised hopes that the nation was on a steady path to balanced trade _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reported extremely strong economic growth in early 1988, raising the possibility that Japanese inflation would increase and undermine the value of the yen In another potential inflation signal, the Japanese and West German money supplies have been growing rapidly. _ The finance leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations left open the possibility that they would tolerate a further increase in the dollar's value But those explanations -LRB- and others -RRB- notwithstanding, the latest dollar rise is more of a quirk than a response to fundamentals. The truth is that no one is certain what the dollar's `` natural'' value is _ if there is even such a thing After all, history shows the dollar can swing a long way from equilibrium. In early 1985 the dollar was worth twice what it is worth now in terms of yen and marks. In light of that experience, who can say for sure it is properly valued now? Although the latest pressure on the dollar has been upward, one group of economists says it should fall another 15 or 20 percent. Psychology _ the mass psychology of the markets _ is the real reason for the dollar's latest move. Traders who make a living by trading currencies were bored and frustrated by the months of stability in the dollar. Some of them undoubtedly made profits by engineering a rally in the dollar. The dollar's strength is new and it could be short-lived. As recently as the first quarter of this year, private investors were so chary of the dollar that foreign central banks were forced to finance more than 60 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account deficit. Foreign official assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose $ 25 billion in the three-month period, more than in any quarter of 1987, notes <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, senior economist of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Sometime around April, Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said, `` There was a massive change in psychology.'' Suddenly, she said, private foreign investors decided they were n't afraid to hold dollars. `` It's one of the virtuous-circle kind of things. The dollar has remained stable, so people think the dollar will continue to remain stable. It just keeps feeding on itself.'' Virtuous circles can quickly change to vicious circles. `` As long as you are dependent on foreign capital inflows, the dollar is extremely vulnerable,'' noted <PERSON> Jai </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajaj </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Yes, he said, it is possible that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will move surely and steadily from trade deficit to trade surplus by sometime in 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the next administration may make steady progress on reducing the federal budget deficit. But then again, ill-timed moves in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or a sudden deterioration in the trade account could inspire a run on the dollar, <ORGANIZATION> Bajaj </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You can very easily fracture foreign confidence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic management,'' he said. `` I see lots of slippages. Lots of danger.''

 The stock market retreated slightly Thursday in moderate trading, weakened by investors cashing profits from the strong gains of the previous two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which had risen nearly 70 points over Tuesday and Wednesday to the highest level since the October crash, lost 3.91 points to close at 2,148.29. Broader indexes were largely lower. Some traders were disheartened by what they called the market's failure to sustain the momentum of a rally that began two days earlier They said it reflected a reluctance by a broad range of investors to commit significant money to the market for a prolonged period. `` When a market or a stock breaks out and it's in good shape, what you normally do is at for least several days put some legs under it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a vice president and market technician at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` So I would have to argue that at least so far, the fact we're unable to follow through is a negative, not a positive. Others were more optimistic and said the slight retreat should be regarded as a sign of underlying strength. `` The back-to-back days of the magnitude we had are probably some cause for some profit-taking,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldowney </PERSON>, head of equity and over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stringfellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I'm not at all discouraged by this.'' Others said they expected large institutional investors and money managers to put cash into stocks over the next several sessions to bolster portfolios before the quarter ends June 30. That development likely would raise prices. In addition, they said foreigners likely will be increasingly attracted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks if the dollar's strength is sustained. That would be another positive for the stock market. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about an 8-to-7 ratio in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 803 issues down, 708 up and 473 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> totaled 185.77 million shares, down from 217.51 million in the previous session. More than 21 million shares of the volume Thursday was due to dividend-capture trading strategies in <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, which rose \ to 28 | <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was the most prominent blue-chip issue, surging 2 -RCB- to 125 -RCB- after having gained nearly 6 in the previous two sessions. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -RCB- to 46 -RRB- after reports emerged that the company was under investigation for possibly manipulating the stock of former takeover target <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> denied any wrongdoing <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> jumped 3 ~ to 94 | after <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> reportedly upgraded its investment rating on the airline Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 213.88 million shares.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All three measures of the nation's money supply tumbled in mid-June, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $ 2.1 billion in the week ended June 13 to a seasonally adjusted $ 771.8 billion from $ 773.9 billion the previous week. It said the measure known as M2 fell $ 4.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,013 billion from $ 3,018 billion. An even broader measure, M3, fell $ 1.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,794 billion from $ 3,796 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. The central bank considers the two broader measures of the money supply as well as the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates in setting its monetary policy But most economists say that recent movements in the money supply do not appear to have played a very significant role in those deliberations. In other reports Thursday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 952 million in the week ended June 15, compared with a gain of $ 133 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said discount window borrowings, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 498 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 562 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 278.2 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 276.1 billion two weeks earlier

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s stock market reeled Thursday after a shake-up at the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the director, the operations chief and billions of missing pesos had to be replaced. Exchange officials said Wednesday they had accepted the resignations of Director-General <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Segura </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiroz </PERSON> and Operations Director <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Balsaldua </PERSON>, who has been in a coma since attempting suicide last month. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, who was once vice president of the exchange's regulatory agency, was named interim director-general Officials also said they were revamping the exchange's controls, finances, administration and operations. The volatile market promptly nose-dived, closing down 10,968.95 points, about 5.45 percent. `` It's a big drop. There's no question,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, author of a Mexican best-seller on investing and head of investment strategy at a leading brokerage house here. Some analysts blamed the stock exchange's fall, at least in part, on the scandal, saying it had shaken investor confidence. Others called it an expected correction. `` There's never just one reason for things to happen,'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The market has risen rather sharply since mid-May, from 144,000 to 203,000 _ about 33 percent. We expected a correction.'' The reorganization came after an audit revealed the exchange was missing at least 15.7 billion pesos of its own _ not investors' _ money, or about $ 7 million. It is still not clear whether the money vanished through fraud, mismanagement or a combination of the two. Exchange officials say the shortage could reach 20 billion pesos or more. Exchange President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harp </PERSON> <PERSON> Helu </PERSON> said Wednesday that the condition of the operations director, in a coma since shooting himself on May 13 at the exchange, has `` blocked a precise understanding of'' what happened to the money. Last year, the Mexican market was one of the world's hottest. But it fell 74 percent in 28 trading days following the worldwide stock crash in mid-October. Officials have been struggling to restore confidence in the market and minimize the growing scandal. In addition to the reorganization, members of the exchange replaced the missing money and agreed to a code of ethics. Some critics have complained about the exchange's failure to turn the case over to judicial authorities for a criminal investigation.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge On Break In Drought-Fear Fever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices dropped sharply Tuesday in frenzied trading that pushed the July contract to a 15-year high near $ 11 a bushel before uncertainty about the weather caused a nervous wave of selling. Corn and wheat futures also retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, while oats advanced the permissable limit for the fourth consecutive session and hit new record highs on fears of further damage to the drought-ravaged crop. On other markets, cotton futures plunged; livestock and meat futures fell steeply; energy futures were mixed; precious metals were lower and stock-index futures also lost ground. `` We're trading hysteria right now,'' <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, a New York-based grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the soybean market's erratic performance. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> grain and soybean markets opened sharply higher on fears of deepening drought damage, but only oat futures sustained the bullish momentum on reports estimating oat yield losses of at least 50 percent. Soybean futures began falling sharply at midday after the price for July had traded up the 45-cent limit to $ 10.99 -LCB- a bushel. Corn and wheat rapidly followed suit. `` I was seeing quotes on my machine 10 cents behind what the market was trading,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said she knew of no change in weather forecasts and blamed the selloff on a loss of nerve among inexperieced speculators. But <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, soybean analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said some traders were worried that storms in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could spawn a hurricane that might eventually bring some moisture to the Farm Belt. `` The market is so nervous right now that even the remote possibility of rain was enough to trigger the big selloff today,'' <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said some traders suddenly realized the enormity of their risk and decided to take profits. Wheat settled unchanged to 6 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 3.80 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.48 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 15 cents higher with July at $ 3.48 a bushel; soybeans were 23 -LCB- cents lower to 6 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 10.32 -LCB- a bushel. Most cotton futures plunged their 2-cents-a-pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, primarily in reaction to the drop in soybean prices, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, cotton specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Cotton for July delivery settled 2 cents lower at 66.40 cents a pound On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, livestock and meat futures continued to move in the opposite direction of the grains on the theory that high feed prices and lack of grazing land will force cattle and pork producers to send more animals to slaughter, analysts said. Cattle and pork futures fell the limit early in the day, then rose from their lows later in the session as soybean prices fell. Live cattle were unchanged to 1.10 cents lower with August at 62.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 cent to 1.27 cents lower with August at 69.77 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to the limit 1.50 cents lower with July at 44.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with July at 40 cents a pound. Oil futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with near-term gasoline contracts up sharply on the drought-induced shipping slowdown on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 15 cents higher with August at $ 16.37 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent lower to .32 cent higher with July at 43.94 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .01 cent to .66 cent higher with July at 51.06 cents a gallon. Precious metals futures dipped slightly on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold was $ 1.80 to $ 2.10 lower with August at $ 450.90 a troy ounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.6 cents lower with July at $ 6.985 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures slipped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .80 point lower at 277.15

<HEAD>Judge Finds No Evidence Union Staged Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge said Thursday he found no evidence the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> instigated a massive overtime boycott at <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, which was forced to cancel 179 flights over the Memorial Day holiday. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Standish </PERSON> said the refusal of many flight attendants to work overtime during the three-day weekend was `` part of a concerted refusal to fly,'' he said evidence was insufficient to prove the union ordered or encouraged such a job action. The judge stopped short, however, of denying <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction barring future overtime boycotts. He said he would issue a ruling on the airline's request Friday. Although neither side would claim victory or defeat, flight attendants union attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said, `` Clearly he -LRB- Standish -RRB- has n't found any proof of union involvement so far.'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> declined to comment on the judge's actions until a ruling is issued He said the airline has no plans to change its long-standing tradition of scheduling overtime for its flight attendants. About 11,000 passengers were affected when hundreds of flight attendants refused to work overtime during Memorial Day. The airline said it lost an estimated $ 1.1 million. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> officials testified during the two-day hearing that about one-third of the airline's flight attendants routinely work more than the 85 hours a month mandated by their contract. Under their two-year pact, which expires in August, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,000 flight attendants can choose to work up to, but no more than, 95 hours a month <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> sued the union last week amid stalled contract negotiations with the 1,000 flight attendants of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which merged with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> in April. Flight attendants union spokeswoman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> said major unresolved issues in the negotiations, which began in July and currently are being mediated, include an airline proposal to pay <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' former attendants at a different rate than <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has a two-tiered pay system for its flight attendants, and the proposal for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers would create two additional tiers until parity is attained in three years, she said. If <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> could have proved union involvement in the Memorial Day job action, the flight attendants union could have been in violation of the federal Railway Labor Act, which prohibits organized work slowdowns, strikes, sickouts and other such actions during contract negotiations. On Thursday, Ms. <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> testified she told attendants at union meetings and in written memos in May that extra flying time was voluntary but did not try to discourage members from working overtime. `` We told them we will not sponsor anything like that,'' she said. But <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinert </PERSON> said impromptu notices posted in crew lounges encouraging an overtime boycott and statements Ms. <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> made to the press expressing her delight over the job action were evidence of union involvement.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has asked federal regulators for permission to begin an electronic bulletin board for price quotations of low-volume, over-the-counter stocks.

<TEXT>
 Government lawyers on Thursday filed a contempt of court petition against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for demanding that a judge in the district court be removed from his position, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathur </PERSON>, the advocate general of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, filed the petition in the state High Court in <LOCATION> Jabalpur </LOCATION>, the news agency said. <LOCATION> Jabalpur </LOCATION> is 347 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The petition said a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> request that Bhopal District Judge M.W. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> excuse himself from hearing the lawsuit against the giant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical company amounted to contempt of court. The Indian government has filed a $ 3 billion suit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> for a toxic gas leak from one of its subsidiary pesticide plants in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The gas leak in December 1984 killed nearly 3,000 people and injured more than 20,000 others, in the world's worst industrial disaster. Judge <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> ruled last December that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> must pay $ 192 million to the gas victims as `` interim relief.'' The ruling, upheld by the state high court, was termed unfair by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> because, the company said, <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> had not ruled on the merits of the case. Union Carbide lawyers then filed an application asking <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> to excuse himself. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> in a ruling last week refused to dissociate himself from the case, saying there were no legal grounds for the request. The contempt of court application Thursday said that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s request was a direct attack on <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> and an attempt to intimidate him. It was designed to obstruct the course of justice, the petition said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and two employees have been ordered to show why they are n't in contempt of court for failing to provide documents to a federal grand jury. A <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman issued a terse statement late Thursday denying that the incident is related to a major investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement practices and saying the company believes it has now resolved the dispute. The order, signed Wednesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and released Thursday, did not provide much insight into the matter, as <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> ordered other court documents sealed to preserve the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings.

That order was, in turn, a response to a grand jury subpoena of <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION> on May 25, the court order said. It also orders both the company and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant general counsel, to show why they should n't be held in both civil and criminal contempt for the same reason Judge <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> gave the men and the company until 4:30 p.m. Friday to respond. The avionics division makes electronic aviation communications and navigation equipment for military use.

<HEAD>Kickoff of Big Antitrust Suit Against Insurance Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A tough-talking federal judge on Thursday kicked off pre-trial sessions of a massive, 18-state antitrust lawsuit against some of the nation's major insurance companies, accused of a conspiracy to cut liability coverage for government and business. Reporters were told there could be as many as 15 more plaintiffs _ presently unnamed companies from around the country _ before the complex case goes to trial years from now. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, leading the plaintiffs, said after the two-hour session that he would `` be happy'' if the trial could begin three years from now. The states are asking for unspecified damages and an injunction to prevent the insurers from repeating alleged violations. A major contributor to the insurance crisis was `` an illegal boycott,'' because the companies pressured the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,400-member industry trade group, to quit distributing standard forms to make it difficult for individual companies to continue offering certain liability coverage. There will be no emotional, jury-type pleadings, only the facts, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON> warned a huge ceremonial courtroom of more than 100 lawyers representing the plaintiffs and 32 insurance companies, underwriting agencies and brokers. `` There will be no duplicate arguments,'' the judge sternly ordered. The opening session was the lawsuit's status conference, roughly the judge's procedural `` road map'' aimed at narrowing the issues, setting rules and limits for discovery, and naming motion, argument and hearing dates leading to trial. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Severi </PERSON> said he anticipated that 14 or 15 more plaintiffs would be joining the action. He said a multi-district panel would decide how the new complaints would be heard. <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON>, referring to himself as a `` resource'' of the case forced to limit the volume of documents laid before him, strenuously resisted efforts to convince him to handle defendants on an individual basis. Some defense lawyers estimated that the plaintiffs' two years of investigation had produced 100,000 pages and that the companies were entitled to see them as part of discovery. The judge said he was n't so sure of that. The judge limited to 25 pages pleadings pertaining to the law, principally the McCarran-Ferguson Act, that says insurance companies ca n't be sued for antitrust violations unless conspiracy is involved. The plaintiff states are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> filed a similar suit in its own state court. Regarding discovery _ information either side is entitled to learn about the other's case _ the judge said he would take `` a dim view'' of efforts aimed at `` broad exploratory'' disclosures. `` Discovery is limited to issues that are essential to deal with the issues on both sides,'' ruled <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON>, one of the nation's most respected jurists on management of issues of disclosure The judge ordered a limit of six months for discovery, all motions to be filed by Dec. 16, state responses on April 18, 1989; arguments June 16, 1989, and a hearing July 7, 1989. The leading defendants are <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. They are accused of arranging among themselves, starting around 1984, to make liability insurance unavailable or prohibitively expensive. `` Anti-consumer revisions were made in the -LRB- forms -RRB- as a result of boycotts, threats, intimidation and other coercive conduct by the defendants,'' said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> complaint by state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-1 to reject the latest contract offered by movie and television producers and to continue its 4-month-old strike, union officials said Thursday. The producers' alliance immediately responded by declaring there was nothing more to negotiate and that it would produce as many fall TV shows as possible, and begin layoffs if unable to complete the schedule. `` Negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> have concluded,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have nothing else to discuss with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. No further meetings are scheduled.'' Other than a few shows whose producers have signed contracts independent of the alliance for such programs as `` The Cosby Show'' and `` The Tonight Show,'' virtually all fall entertainment programming is threatened by the strike. The writers voted was 2,789 to 933, or 74.9 percent in favor of rejection and 25.1 percent in favor of acceptance. `` We remain ready, willing and able to conclude negotiations,'' union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said the rejected offer was substantially better than the preceding two offers and he credited chief executive officers of major studios `` who joined with us in attempting to end this strike.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the only further talks would have to be `` a telephone call saying they're willing to sign the strike settlement offer as is.'' `` We are now moving ahead to produce as many programs as we can. We will do everything we can to get the town back to work. If we can not produce our fall schedules in their entirety we will curtail operations as required.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said that meant layoffs and shutting down facilities. `` The message to the companies is loud and clear,'' said <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` Our members want a contract that resolves the key issues of the strike. If the companies end their inflexibility, which forced the strike and prolonged it, we can end this strike quickly and put everyone in our industry back to work.'' Ballots were cast during an often tumultuous membership meeting Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and another gathering in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Writers opposing rejection of the proposed contract had conceded they would lose, but hoped to get enough votes to convince union negotiators to end the strike quickly. The union has 9,500 members. The Writers Coalition, a union anti-strike group that includes some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s top writer-producers, had said that 600 to 700 votes for the pact would compel union negotiators to listen to the coalition, said a coalition spokesman who talked on condition of anonymity. `` There is no victory here,'' said coalition member <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON>. `` The strike goes on. We're all losing.'' Business people from lighting suppliers to restaurant and deli owners said Thursday the contract's rejection would hurt. `` If the television shows do n't show up in August and September, the whole industry will be hurting,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clairmont </PERSON>, whose Clairmont Cameras supplies television crews. Members voted in person or by proxy on the latest offer from the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group representing about 200 studios. Chief union negotiator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> received a standing ovation late Wednesday when he told the crowded meeting inside the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palladium </LOCATION> `` I think the strike will end sooner and it will end on fairer terms'' if the latest offer is rejected. The rancorous meeting included shouted obscenities, hallway arguments and booed-down speakers as it moved into the late night hours. Producers claim their four-year package will be worth an extra $ 71 million to writers and offers an across-the-board increase in residuals of 14.7 percent. Payments to writers at present total about $ 360 million a year, producers' spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. The guild claims its negotiators accepted a flexible formula for payment on one-hour televison shows sold for reruns but was not rewarded with a more generous offer for shows sold overseas. The union has linked the two items in an economic package. With the new production season upcoming, lack of a contract could hurt businesses who deal with major production companies that have not signed independent contracts with the guild. Other firms, which have dealt largely with independent production companies that have signed seperate contracts or hired non-union crews, have said the strike has had little or no effect. `` Some are hurting and some are cleaning up with all the non-union work this has created. When this strike started, we started shipping tons of equipment to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> firm that supplies camera and lighting equipment. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahlquist </PERSON>, president of Key Lite, said his firm supplies lighting equipment to the major studios and has been affected. `` We have had quite a bit of slowdown. We've had to lay people off and had a slowdown of production,'' <PERSON> Dahlquist </PERSON> said. `` We have gone through this before,'' said <PERSON> Dahlquist </PERSON>. `` There will be some independent productions, regardless of a strike. And there is usually a tremendous surge after the strike is over, and that more than makes up for the losses.'' At Art's Deli in <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, near the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> lot, owner <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> bemoaned empty lunchtime tables. `` We are off a good 10-to-15 percent,'' he said. `` Not only are the writers and producers not coming in, but also the agents meeting with clients, the drivers, and all the related businesses.''

 Deputy Assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, suspected of being one of several <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who smuggled classified information to a defense consultant, has begun telling prosecutors what he knows about the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> corruption case, sources said Thursday. `` There has been some interest shown on the part of some individuals in cooperating with the investigation,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said some information `` has already been obtained.'' According to other sources, <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, whose office was searched last week, is believed to be one of several people who passed procurement information to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official-turned-consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> copied the documents with the aid of his wife. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> allegedly passed the sensitive information along to his major client, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> worked together at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in the 1970s. An attorney for the Paisleys, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, rejected the accounts of the Paisleys' alleged activities and criticized the government for leaking information about the investigation. He said it is ironic that leaks are occurring `` in a case in which the government is alleging improper disclosure of sensitive information.'' Meanwhile, a former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>, said he passed along information to the government more than six years ago that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had bragged of committing a felony wiretapping operation and of conducting bribery internationally on military projects. <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>'s information was contained in a Feb. 4, 1982 letter to former <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Republican Gov. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, who gave it to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s close friend, <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday night. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> said in an April 21, 1982 letter to <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON> that the matter had been referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>, who said he has a copy of the letter. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday on <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>'s allegations and the exchange of letters. <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> called <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>'s accusations `` unfounded'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had conducted a full background check on <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> before he was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post he left last year. At the heart of the investigation are allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts. Prosecutor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told congressmen Wednesday he is looking into 75 to 100 contracts worth `` tens of billions of dollars.'' While <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is talking with prosecutors, another <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official whose office was searched, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, is negotiating with the government on whether to do the same, the sources said. Both <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> had key procurement jobs in the Pentagon. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> was deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for acquisition management while <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was a top aide to the deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control, communications and computer systems. Both men have been reassigned since the investigation became public. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters Thursday he has arranged for a report on the present status of the investigation. Responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visiting Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I am asking, and have arranged _ they are coming over to give me a full report.'' He said the report would deal with the question of `` where are we now and how much do we know already?'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, who was brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as an undersecretary to reform its procurement system, said former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> is `` 100 percent wrong'' in defending the way the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spends $ 160 billion a year on purchases of weapons and other goods and services. `` We have institutionalized a bad system,'' said <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, who, like <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, had been an executive at the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a vast construction conglomerate. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said he quit in frustration last fall after 18 months at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, where he was supposed to carry out reforms recommended by a commission headed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday he thought procurement procedures in effect at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` are proper.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said Thursday that it had searched several more sites in the last two weeks that it had not revealed previously, including <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which was searched this week. Last week, investigators searched the home and office of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poquott </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who works in the surveillance and fire control division of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> plant, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had announced last week that it had searched that <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> plant as well as the <LOCATION> Malverne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, home of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> vice president. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> revealed Thursday that it had served search warrants on <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, who works with <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a defense electronics firm which had been searched last week, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oakton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. It could not be determined immediately if the agents had searched their homes or offices or both. Chief Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> held his first meeting with <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and like <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, was not briefed about the affair until just before it became public knowledge. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> declined to discuss the substance of the briefing received by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for eastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, or say how frequently the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary expected to be updated on the matter. The spokesman also acknowledged the Pentagon has not taken steps yet to inhibit the business dealings of defense consultants whose names have surfaced in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials identified in the investigation temporarily reassigned to other jobs. `` We simply can not take an action on the basis of press reports,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Now, we have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to inform us of the names of individuals who may be involved in the investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> has provided us with no names beyond the limited number in this building. `` And until and unless we are given such information, we can not take any action. We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time. But we are in a kind of limbo here at the moment until this investigation proceeds further,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Defense Department Inspector General <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters she did n't consider the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> a `` soft touch'' when it came to contract fraud and thought the department was getting the message across to industry that white-collar crime does n't pay. The number of contractor suspensions and debarments has soared from roughly 80 a year in 1981 to about 900 a year now and criminal prosecutions also have climbed significantly, she said. `` I think we're doing a very aggressive job in this area,'' she said, adding that the current probe `` is a perfect example of how the system is working.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, meantime, dropped plans to release by Friday the affidavits filed by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in support of requests for search warrants. He had said earlier this week he hoped to unseal them. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibbley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, said `` we really have n't set a time for releasing the search warrants and affidavits.'' `` Once the search warrants are returned, they are usually opened,'' she noted. `` They will be, but not right now.'' Asked the reason for the delay, she said, `` We do n't feel it would be beneficial to have them opened at this time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> discussed the case Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and several other senators and chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., later announced that hearings will be held after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' July 4 recess on the military's contracting system `` to find whether there are a few rotten apples or many rotten applies or basic flaws in the procurement system. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> tentatively scheduled hearings for next week on the procurement system.
