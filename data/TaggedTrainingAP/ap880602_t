 Perhaps the most important thing <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this summit was the statement that he no longer thinks the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` an evil empire.'' As a bonus, to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s delight, the renunciation came `` within the walls of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, next to the czar's gun.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s characterization of this vast communist nation in a March 1983 speech unleashed a torrent of comment in the Soviet media at the time, the start of a deep freeze in superpower relations symbolized by the break-off of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms talks in November that year. In a nation that craves international respect, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism was taken as an intensely personal slight His retraction of the comment in remarks Tuesday to reporters at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was duly remarked upon by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at an unprecedented <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference on Wednesday _ a session televised across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with excerpts repeated on the evening news. `` Within the walls of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, next to the czar's gun, right in the heart of the evil empire,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> beamed, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had responded `` No'' when asked if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still deserved the appellation. `` We take note of this,'' added <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking not just for himself, but for the communist leadership of a nation of 280 million people. It was just weeks after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> branded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire'' that the Soviets launched one of their most ambitious efforts to counteract what they see as malicious American propaganda about a nation of which they are raised to feel supremely proud. On April 25, 1983, then Soviet leader <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> invited <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> schoolgirl <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to visit his country and see for herself that his people do not want war. In July, <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>, then 11, came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was given a topflight tour of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, and spending four days with Soviet kids at an elite camp for <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Loaded down with 17 suitcases of presents from Soviets who warmed to her bright smile, <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and delivered the judgment <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wanted to hear _ that the Soviets `` are almost just like Americans.'' Similar, but less lavish, efforts are expended when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace groups visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came to power, these groups have come ever more regularly to `` the evil empire,'' promoting peace and friendship with the Soviets and joining <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in denouncing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president for pushing <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> and strengthened Western defenses. With arms talks dead throughout 1984 and cultural contacts at a virtual standstill, these groups were almost the only Americans that Soviets got to see _ and they made sure to put on their best show. The Kremlin, which has long financed a finely tuned, expensive system to train some of the world's premier athletes, even gave up on the chance to prove Soviet prowess that year at the Olympics. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> boycotted the 1984 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> extravaganza that in so many ways epitomized the glitzy, we-feel-good-again spirit of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term In January 1985, arms control talks resumed again. In March 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power, promoting `` new thinking'' in foreign policy and doing a rapid image makeover on Kremlin politicians. The new leader and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> had wowed Fleet Street on a trip to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in December 1984, astonishing Britons used to dour, dumpy Russians with their lively manners, good humor and handling of the press. With a sure touch sometimes attributed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, now a Politburo member but once a student of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ways as ambassador to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has successfully projected a new image. Reforms at home, greater openness to the outside world and improved relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have given the new image substance, adding up to an act that apparently has changed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mind about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> somewhat And <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can show his home audience that his efforts to mend relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ criticized at first by hardliners _ have paid dividends. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> 1985 declaration he signed with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at their first summit committed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to saying that `` a nuclear war must never be fought and can not be won.'' The now-ratified INF treaty removed the danger of <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles reaching <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in eight minutes from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. With the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is no longer `` the evil empire,'' even in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s book. As the president himself explained it, that description belonged to `` another time, another era.''

<HEAD>Reagans Treated To A Night On The Town, Moscow Style</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> did up the town, Moscow-style, on their last night here, taking in the ballet at the opulent Bolshoi Theater, dining with the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> at a dacha owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and strolling through a moonlit Red Square. With summit business over, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed in good spirits Wednesday night, moving their seats closer together in the `` Royal Box'' the Soviet and American first couples shared at the Bolshoi and briefly clasping one another's waists as they left the ballet. But their wives, who ruffled one another's feathers earlier in the day during a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Tretyakov Gallery, appeared cool to one another and did not speak. After their private dinner at the Communist Party-owned country home on the outskirts of western <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, holding hands, made an impromptu stop at Red Square, walking on the cobblestone plaza between St. Basil's Cathedral and the Kremlin. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> described his Soviet evening on the town as `` wonderful ... very warm and hospitable.'' He said the couple stopped at Red Square `` because <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has n't seen it We're leaving tomorrow and I did n't want her to miss it.'' The Reagans leave this morning for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where they will spend a day before returning Friday to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In the six-tiered, gold and red Bolshoi on Sverdlov Square, the audience of about 2,000, most of them Soviets, applauded the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> both at the ballet's beginning and again at its end. The dancers also ended their performance by clapping for the leaders and their wives. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> waved back at the audience, both grinning broadly. The Reagans appeared to enjoy the hour and a half of ballet. It was the first night of pure entertainment on their schedule, which had previously included official dinners complete with political toasts and journalists. But even the last evening included a touch of patriotism. American and Soviet flags hung on either side of the `` Royal Box'' at the rear of the theater, and the orchestra played national anthems from both countries before the ballet began. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mouthed the words of the American anthem while <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held her right hand at her heart. The Reagans and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> used opera glasses to watch the Bolshoi Ballet perform excerpts from `` Sleeping Beauty,'' `` Swan Lake'' and `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>.'' The last excerpt was performed by <PERSON> Nine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ananiashvili </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andris </PERSON> <PERSON> Liepa </PERSON>, winners of a 1986 world ballet competition in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, Miss. The Bolshoi Theater, founded in 1776, was the first permanent theater in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and its ballet and opera companies gained an international reputation in the 1950s and 1960s. Tickets cost about three rubles -LRB- five dollars -RRB- but are nearly impossible for Soviets to obtain without contacts in the theater or luck enough to receive an allocation at their jobs.

 In a match marked more by good will than athletic prowess, <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> capitalized on eight errors by a team of Soviet engineers to take a 15-2 victory in the first baseball showdown between the superpowers. Before the historic game, played at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> stadium, the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> team presented the Soviets with souvenir T-shirts, and both sides clasped hands and hugged as Western reporters in town for the summit meeting crowded around. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, busy elsewhere, was unable to throw out the first pitch. A public address announcer chattered away about the rules of baseball, even during play, to a crowd just learning about the sport. But the 300 or so fans still seemed to enjoy the game, cheering lustily when the Soviet team from the D.I. <ORGANIZATION> Mendeleyev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> did well and whistling in derision when it botched a play. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> struck immediately in the first inning when leadoff batter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Finegan </PERSON> doubled off the left field fence and scored on two successive wild pitches by <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshivoy </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jays </ORGANIZATION> put the game out of reach in the third inning, while leading 2-0, when first baseman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durocher </PERSON> walked, advanced to second on a Koshivoy wild pitch and scored on a single by second baseman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. After two successive errors loaded the bases, third baseman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> hit a drive that eluded centerfielder <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupenchenkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> came all the way home to make the score 7-0. The Soviets did n't get a base runner until the fourth inning and scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings on errant pickoff attempts. `` It was not our best game,'' said <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Korneyev </PERSON>, the Soviets' third baseman The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began its baseball program in 1987, in anticipation of baseball becoming an Olympic sport in 1992. A national squad played a team from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last summer, but lost by scores of 22-0 and 30-2. Earlier this week, the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> players spent several practice sessions teaching the Soviets the finer points of the game, and although the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jays </ORGANIZATION> praised their competitors' desire and athletic abilities, they expected the game to be a bit of a mismatch. `` They made some outstanding plays out there,'' said <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> Coach <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Babb </PERSON>. `` But they still have problems with routine ones.'' <PERSON> Finegan </PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, praised the Soviets' athletic ability, but noted that `` baseball is a unique sport You need to have skills that are more refined. They also have not seen pitchers that are more refined.'' <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> alumnus <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaxman </PERSON>, a Moscow-based businessman, was responsible for bringing the Soviets together with the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jays </ORGANIZATION>, who had a 26-12 record this year. He had heard the Soviets were seeking an American squad for some exhibition games, and suggested the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> team. The Soviet media publicized the game, and several newspapers ran stories that caught the spirit of good will. A front-page article in Tuesday's editions of the newspaper Sovietsky Sport carried the headline: `` When the score does n't count.

 Music poured from the front-seat tape deck. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> snapped his fingers to the beat, and his friends passed around cigarettes and pictures of their wives for the visiting Americans to see. This was n't an impromptu gathering of youth on the Arbat pedestrian mall, but an assemblage of the usually staid gray-suited security agents who guard Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Relaxing during a two-and-a-half hour wait for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife to finish dinner at a Communist Party-owned dacha outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a dozen security men bantered with their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts, showing off the Zil limousines they travel in and joining in an American betting pool on when the Reagans would emerge from the walled compound. `` At exactly 12 midnight!'' contended an agent identified only as <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON>, arguing with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agent who insisted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never stays out that late. `` I'm not just taking a guess, I'm providing you with information,'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> stated knowingly. The American stuck by his 11 p.m. estimate, challenging, `` We'll see whose intelligence is better. Some of the security detachment had accompanied <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December, but the agents who had never seen <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> showed the most curiosity about life in the other superpower. They compared housing costs, divorce rates and the vastly different attitudes toward smoking in their countries. The Zil tour was impressive for the journalists, who acted as translators between the security squads. The sleek black limos are usually seen flashing past at 60 miles per hour on the broad avenue that leads from this parklike estate to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. `` This costs 100,000 rubles -LRB- $ 167,000 at the official exchange rate -RRB- here,'' one of the Soviets offered with an aim to impress that would rival any car salesman. `` It's got genuine Karelian birchwood lining on the doors and all around the windows.'' One of the Americans, who did not want to be identified, said that the Soviets were a little tense on the first day of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit, but that the two groups quickly became accustomed to working together on their nearly identical tasks of protecting the leader `` Discipline is discipline and surveillance is surveillance,'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> explained, when asked how the two teams worked together. The nattily dressed agents from both superpowers took turns posing for souvenir pictures. Floodlights blinked and a telephone call to the guard shack outside the compound at 10:40 p.m. alerted both teams to the presidential party's intended departure, causing moans from the bettors who had guessed the party would break up later. The agents instantly snapped to attention, with the Soviets diving into the limousines and escort cars and the Americans climbing into their wagons. The entourage got back to business so quickly that the head of the American security detachment had no chance to collect his bet winnings. His guess of 11 p.m. was only six seconds off the mark.

<HEAD>Mrs. Reagan `Rolls With Punches' In Uncertainties Of Raisa
Relationship</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has `` learned to roll with the punches'' when dealing with the uncertainties of meeting <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and has achieved more balance in their relationship, the first lady's spokeswoman says. The clear impression left after the two strong-willed women squared off in a Soviet art gallery Wednesday was that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has become far more assertive in dealing with the outspoken Soviet first lady. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today after wrapping up their summit activities here with a farewell visit to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and a meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy employees. They return home Friday after the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stopover. For the first time, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged during a tour of the Tretyakov Gallery's icons that the frosty relationship, the focus of months of intense media scrutiny, is real. `` A Mexican standoff,'' the first lady said with a shrug, when asked how the relationship stood. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, later observed, `` They are from two totally different worlds.'' Under a veneer of politeness, the two first ladies engaged in an intense competition for the spotlight. `` I want to say something. I want to say something now, OK?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted sharply one point as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attempted to stop reporters from questioning the American first lady. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> backed away, but pointedly looked at her watch as the first lady chatted with members of the White House press corps. When Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried to break in again and start the gallery tour, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rebuffed her and returned to her conversation with reporters. On the surface, things were pleasant enough, but the delicately arched eyebrows and strained smiles told a far different story. Instead of strolling hand-in-hand as they had at events earlier this week, the two women apparently had decided to show more of their true feelings. It brought to mind a similar encounter during the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> dominated a White House tour by seeking out the press with lengthy commentaries on history, art and political life, as Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was left trying to get her long-planned tour under way. During Wednesday's session with reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and her Soviet aides kept changing the arrangements for the event, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides said. Instead of meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as planned by the outside door of the gallery, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had come to the special vault where they were to view the art and talked at length with the press corps. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has learned to be flexible with the Soviets at Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s events, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. `` She's learned to roll with the punches,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. Noting that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spoken out more in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than she did at the December summit, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said she believed they now had `` more balance'' and equality in their relationship. Not surprisingly, the first lady said that her five days of exposure to the glories of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> art and architecture wo n't change her mind about the Soviet system `` We have two different ways of living, two different philosophies,'' she said. One day earlier, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had termed the Soviet system a `` more controlled'' society than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Asked if she'd become a convert to communism during her stay here, the first lady gave a hearty laugh, saying, `` Oh, no!''

 Hallmark Cards will stop making graduation cards that emphasize drinking, following protests by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION>, the company said Wednesay. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City-based card manufacturer, said the company decided Tuesday `` to discontinue manufacturing and shipping alcohol-related graduation cards.'' The controversy started last week in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, when <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> parents showed <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> officals a card depicting a refrigerator filled with Coors beer and a single egg. `` Do n't go to graduation without a good breakfast first,'' the card reads. Another card suggests that graduates wear loose-fitting gowns so they can `` hide at least two bottles of champagne underneath.'' `` How can a company, which advertises, ` When you care enough to send the very best, send Hallmark,' produce cards which encourage alcohol and drunken driving?'' asked <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Ms. <PERSON> Cater </PERSON> said Tuesday's decision was insufficient because the cards are still available in some stores. However, Ms. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said graduation season is coming to an end and `` most of the cards will come down very shortly.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said she did not have exact figures on the number of graduation cards that had reference to alcohol. `` Hallmark offers about 600 graduation card designs, and less than 1 percent deal with alcohol-related subject matter,'' she said. `` It is a very small percentage.'' She said the complaints that spurred the company's action came primarily from <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Diplomatic Sources Say 28 Refusenik Cases Unresolved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Western diplomatic source says 28 refusenik cases have not been resolved, contrary to information from Soviet Jewish leaders that the cases were cleared for emigration as a result of meetings between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Jewish leaders had evidently misunderstood the situation. The confusion arose over a meeting between Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> and a group of six refuseniks Wednesday morning. Refusenik scientist <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON> showed reporters a list of 400 names that he said had been submitted to <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> on Saturday for discussion with Soviet officials at meetings during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. He said <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> told the group that 28 of the cases had been solved in the meetings taking place during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But the Western diplomatic source said later that no cases had been solved. Other refusenik sources said more than a dozen families from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> had received permission to emigrate in the past 10 days. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> refusenik <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinshtock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iosif </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilmenshtein </PERSON> families of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had received permission to emigrate this week. <PERSON> Refusenik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON>, who demonstrated daily in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with his wife and year-old daughter last week, said he was summoned to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visa office on Saturday and was told he could leave the country on Monday. <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON> said he knew of three <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> families who also had received permission to leave the country. About 40 other refuseniks, many of them accompanied by their children, held a peaceful, half-hour demonstration Wednesday within sight of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, waving banners demanding that they be allowed to emigrate. An agency helping Jewish emigres said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Wednesday that the number allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached 1,145 in May, a seven-year high. The May figure was the fourth straight monthly increase and brought the total for 1988 to 4,547, said the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>. More than 8,000 Jews were permitted to emigrate in 1987, a sharp increase from previous years but far below the peak of more than 51,000 in 1979.

<TEXT>
 The relationship has never been more special. So it is only natural that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is visiting <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, his ideological soulmate and closest foreign ally, to tell her about the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two-day visit, another boost to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister's prestige on the international stage, comes six months after Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stopped off to confer with her en route to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> superpower summit. Today's is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third and probably last visit as president to a prime minister of whom he said recently, `` We're very good friends and it is a friendship I treasure very much.'' He will confer with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at her No. 10 Downing St. residence, dine there tonight and make a speech Friday on East-West relations before returning home. For <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader has been a sometimes costly, occasionally reproving but super-loyal friend. She rarely criticizes him. Asked in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about revelations about astrology in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, all she would say was: `` I come under <PERSON> Libra </PERSON>, which is a very balanced sign.'' The Anglo-American bond, rooted in a common language, heritage and alliances in two world wars, is the cornerstone of her foreign policy. She stood alone in backing the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>; followed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> out of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> in 1985; was the first to deploy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1983, and last year, when the superpowers agreed to remove the missiles, she put aside her reservations and gave the deal a ringing endorsement. When other European leaders in the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance sometimes grumble about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domination, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s response is blunt. `` She's the largest, most prosperous nation in the world, and let's be thankful she has taken a leadership role,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in a radio interview in March. `` None of us can substitute for it. We could all help with it.'' Her <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy draws opposition taunts of `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s poodle,'' to which she retorts: `` I do n't think I would make a very good poodle. I might be more a sort of bulldog.'' However, some analysts see her as having subtly moved into a prime role in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, using both her special influence with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and, more recently, her good relations with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to exercise power. Elected to office 18 months before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and recently re-elected for an unprecedented third consecutive term, 62-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is the senior stateswoman of the Western world. She shares <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hostility to communism and belief in free markets. She fervently believes nuclear weapons are peacekeepers. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flirted with the idea of a non-nuclear world at the 1986 summit at <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sped to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to make sure he did n't carry disarmament too far _ without consulting his allies. At her instigation, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders held a special summit before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s latest meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. She said the aim was to demonstrate Western unity and show `` that the president is always seen consulting his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies.'' There have been some disagreements. In 1982, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought to withhold U.S.-originated technology from a Soviet natural gas pipeline, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered British companies to fulfill their contracts despite the threat of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backed off, after Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> complained publicly she felt `` deeply wounded by a friend.'' A year later, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> criticized the U.S.-led invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> to overthrow Marxist coup leaders in the former British colony, saying `` You just do n't walk into countries like that.'' More recently, she has chided the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about its budget deficit, making disapproving comparisons with her own stringent policies which have produced a budget surplus. But she has never shied away from backing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a crisis, even when it has left her isolated. She says she has never forgotten that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put his entire Latin American policy at risk to support <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the 1982 <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. In April 1986 she braved uproar in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for allowing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to use British-based bombers in the raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, when other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies had refused to help. She declared, `` I believe friendship is two ways.''

<HEAD>Eugene McCarthy Running For President At 72</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose presidential candidacy two decades ago helped galvanize opposition to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War, has placed himself in the running again this year at the age of 72. `` This year the one thing we have to do is shake up the two-party system, and that's what I hope to do,'' the silver-haired <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> told reporters and onlookers Wednesday near Independence Hall. `` There is no real choice between Democrats and Republicans.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> dismissed the expected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and his likely Democratic opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` There are two kinds of people who do n't make good presidents,'' he said, `` vice presidents and governors.'' The former senator, whose anti-war campaign in 1968 helped bring down President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, is running this year on the Consumer Party ticket. In <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s first campaign, fellow Minnesotan <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> won the Democratic nomination and Republican <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> won the election. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> also tried for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972 and ran as an independent in 1976. This time he hopes to be on the ballot in at least 30 states. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said his latest candidacy was not a futile gesture. `` Sure I've lost before, but I did n't feel I wasted my time, and I expect to have a significant impact,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said: `` We think both the Democrats and Republicans have failed the country, and that we are an alternative, not a spoiler. We'll give the voters an alternative. Millions do n't want to vote for anyone, and we think that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> will attract them.'' The party has about 4,000 members, almost all in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Its platform calls for guaranteed jobs for all Americans, sharp reductions in the military budget, passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and provision of affordable housing for everyone. The party's most successful candidate to date has been <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, a 1987 candidate for <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> won 21 percent of the vote, which was not enough for a seat. The party affiliated itself with the campaigns of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Commoner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Haver </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> would be formally nominated at a convention in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> late this summer. No date was announced. <PERSON> Haver </PERSON> said that he expected <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, to be the party's vice presidential nominee. But <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who says the vice presidency should be abolished, said he expected there would be different running mates in different states.

<TEXT>
 Three major investigations in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area broke off in 1985 when wiretap information was allegedly leaked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee conducting impeachment proceedings against the judge. `` There is nothing to lead me to believe that it could have been any other source than Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>,'' agent <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzella </PERSON> testified Wednesday before the subcommittee on criminal justice. <PERSON> Mazzella </PERSON> said the three investigations into labor racketeering and public corruption had to be ended for fear of endangering the lives of undercover agents and informants. He said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> approved a 30-day wiretap on July 15, 1985, and received `` progress reports'' on it every seven days. On Aug. 15, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> applied to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> for an extension of the tap, attaching an affidavit containing references to <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and a man named <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> `` Waxy'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who was a target of one of the probes. <PERSON> Mazzella </PERSON>, who was in charge of the probes, said the investigations became tainted when <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of information he said he received from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> surmised that the only way anyone would know the information was from a wiretap. <PERSON> Mazzella </PERSON> said the cases involved the local longshoremen's union in zoning code cases in <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION> and police selling drugs in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. He said the wiretap was involved in all three cases. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who still sits on the federal bench in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, has not had a chance to rebut the allegations before the subcommittee. He refused to discuss the case Wednesday with reporters outside the hearing room. <PERSON> Mazzella </PERSON> said he could not find any statement to a law enforcement officer in which <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> either confirmed or denied the allegations. The agent said reporter <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he discussed the allegation with <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> on March 25, 1986, but that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> did not say whether he was the source of the leak. The impeachment proceedings against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> stem from a bribery case in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> involving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>. Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $ 150,000 bribe for <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers. In a separate trial in 1983, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted of the bribery conspiracy charges. But a five-member panel of the Atlanta-based 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which covers <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, concluded there was convincing evidence that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> actually took part in the bribery scheme and then attempted a cover-up by lying under oath and manufacturing evidence. The panel's findings were endorsed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the chief policy-making body of the federal judiciary, and forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders in March 1987 with the advice that `` consideration of impeachment may be warranted.'' The judiciary subcommittee must determine whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> committed the `` high crimes and misdemeanors'' that warrant impeachment. If <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will conduct a trial to determine whether he should be removed from office.

<HEAD>New Radars Will Sharpen America's Weather Eye</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will turn a sharper eye to the weather in the next few years with the installation of a snazzy new radar system jointly funded by a quartet of federal agencies. The new radar will allow meteorologists, for the first time, to see the formation of tornadoes before they reach the ground. They also will be better able to pinpoint the landing site of hurricanes, predict floods and measure the flow of wind, weather scientists say. The first Next Generation Weather Radar installation is under way at <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, with as many as 175 to follow by the mid-1990s, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, the private company building the system, reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> are anteing up $ 450 million for the new system, dubbed NEXRAD. Under development for eight years, the first system was tested at a <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> facility in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> before the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> installation, expected to be operational in thefall. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, one of the nation's leading areas for tornadoes, will test the new radar's `` unique capability to identify rotating wind patterns within storms,'' according to <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Merl </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. While current radar detects only the amount of moisture in the air, the new one can follow its movement. Thus, an operator seeing wind rushing away from him, right next to a severe gust heading toward him, will recognize the signature of a rotating movement, the first sign of tornado development, said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> researcher now directing the radar development program for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. Radar tests have shown that movement can be seen in mid-level clouds, before the twister reaches down for the ground. This means warning time could be expanded to `` tens of minutes,'' <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON> said. Currently the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issues a tornado watch when conditions exist which could spawn a tornado, but ground spotters have to spot the tornadoes to issue actual warnings. The new system could cut false alarms in half, <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON> added. NEXRAD will replace a 30-year-old radar system that provides only limited weather data. <PERSON> Merl </PERSON> said the NEXRAD installations also will be coupled with on-ground rain gauges to measure precipitation for forecast areas where flooding is likely, a system that should improve warnings in flood-prone areas. In addition, <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON> noted that the system will be able to measure the winds within hurricanes within its 145-mile range. With that information, meteorologists will be better able to predict the course of hurricanes to give warnings about where they will strike land, and also to estimate the wind and surge of sea water being pushed ahead of the storm. The system's 28-foot radar dish, enclosed in a fiberglass dome, draws a profile of the air from the surface up to 70,000 feet every six minutes, <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON> explained, providing detailed information even in clear air. Many radars can not detect clear air movement, only air with water vapor or dust or some other debris to reflect the signal. The radar uses the Doppler effect, which depends on a change in frequency in a radio wave. The pencil-thin wave is sent out at a constant frequency, and bounces back off clouds, moving air, dust or whatever it strikes. There is a subtle change of frequency in signals bouncing off something coming toward the radar compared to things moving away. It's the same principle that causes a police or ambulance siren to have a slightly lower pitch when the vehicle is driving away from listeners than it does when coming toward them. <PERSON> Merl </PERSON> also said research is under way for short-range Doppler radar systems at airports to detect local wind shears, sudden shifts in wind speed and direction that have caused several airplane crashes in recent years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to keep track of its huge equipment and supply inventory has resulted in excessive purchases costing `` billions of tax dollars,'' a senator says. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, on Wednesday released a report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> concluding that the accuracy of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inventory records continues to be a problem despite improvements in inventory control. The report also said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> continues to have difficulty determining the causes of inventory inaccuracies and that physical security of the supplies needs to be improved. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> supply items and repair parts are worth more than $ 21 billion. `` While many of these parts are essential to keeping our planes in the air, poor inventory control has resulted in excessive supply purchases costing billions of tax dollars,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> needs to straighten up and fly right when it comes to inventory management.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study was based on audits of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquartered at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and air logistics centers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s adjustment policy allows inventory records and on-hand supplies to remain out of balance by as much as 10 percent and $ 4,999 `` Air Force item managers continue to adjust inventory records without performing adequate research to identify the primary cause for discrepancies,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The risk in this policy is that the records may be erroneously adjusted, possibly resulting in apparent shortages of needed items which are actually on hand, or excess procurements.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said the physical security at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> centers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION> needs to be improved to lessen the risk of theft. It said the storage buildings at <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION> are not separately surrounded by security fencing and that privately owned and contractor vehicles are permitted to park right next to warehouses at all three centers. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzen </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of defense at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said there have been steady and significant improvements in inventory accuracy at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, with accuracy rates approaching 95 percent. `` While these improvements are commendable, the department recognizes that problems still exist that require continued dedication and vigilance,'' <PERSON> Katzen </PERSON> said in a March 17 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The department is pursuing its aggressive action plan to continue improving the process.''

<TEXT>
 A long-held industry axiom that a jetliner can fly many years beyond its initial design life if maintained and inspected properly is coming under closer scrutiny, say some participants in a three-day conference on aging aircraft. It is only one of many technical issues being debated by more than 350 aircraft design and maintenance experts meeting at the FAA-sponsored conference that began Wednesday. The participants represent airlines, aircraft manufacturers, government and aviation safety groups. All were brought together because of an increased concern about the safety of older jetliners since the in-flight breakup of a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 in April. A 20-foot section of the plane tore away at 24,000 feet and a flight attendant was swept to her death, although the pilots managed to land the aircraft safely. <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials have said repeatedly that they followed all required inspections on the jetliner. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that until the federal investigation into the incident is concluded, he could not say whether <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> violated any <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requirements in connection with the plane. But <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said during a break in the conference Wednesday that a key question that must be resolved in the coming months is whether to continue the current philosophy that relies heavily on inspections or shift the focus to a system of mandatory repairs or, at some point, mandatory aircraft retirement. In the case of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, inspectors from both the airlines and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> failed to detect the cracking and corrosion that is believed to have caused the breakup. `` I think we might find that the procedures are adequate, but I'm not convinced the procedures are being done with as much discipline as we might expect,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told reporters. He said the conference is likely to spawn additional, private sessions among industry experts in the coming months on aircraft design, the human pitfalls in the inspection process and whether new federal requirements might be needed. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., one of several congressmen to address the industry group, said that the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident demonstrates `` the inadequacies of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance inspection system. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> must increase its research and development programs on aging aircraft and that the agency should buy old jetliners to determine how long they can be considered to be safe. `` Only by answering the question ` How long can airplanes really last?' will we be able to put into place guidelines which could save thousands of lives,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> told the conference. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Enders </PERSON>, an aviation consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, suggested in an interview that the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident will prompt increased debate over `` whether the economic life of an airplane'' should remain as dominant a factor as it has been in determining when a plane should be taken out of service. Before the Aloha accident `` generally there was a feeling that you can fly a plane indefinitely'' as long as it is properly maintained and inspected, said <PERSON> Enders </PERSON>, suggesting this philosophy may be changing. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the airline trade group, reiterated that with proper maintenance and inspections aircraft `` can fly safely throughout their economically useful life.'' The Aloha plane was one of the oldest <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s in service and had accumulated nearly 90,000 takeoffs and landings.

North, the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel who faces federal conspiracy charges for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, sounded themes of freedom, military might and family values in urging election of conservative Republican <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> to the state's 42nd Congressional District `` Freedom is not free, it must be won, preserved and defended, again and again,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of about 100 at a late-morning rally at a hangar at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He urged voters to return a conservative majority to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that will support continued military spending, saying, `` Freedom is only as strong as its defenders.'' North, sporting his trademark crew cut and gap-toothed grin and attired in a civilian gray suit, ignored about a dozen sign-toting protesters who shouted at him as left the hangar and got into a waiting car. was making his first campaign appearance ever and his second formal public speech since the Iran-Contra hearings, said <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was to attend fund-raisers for <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, then address a $ 250-a-person dinner for <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> at the Spruce Goose. Participants were invited to donate $ 1,000 to attend a reception next door on the ocean liner Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and have a picture taken with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He was set to spend Thursday campaigning for <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a candidate in the 40th Congressional District Republican primary. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, was senior associate counsel for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from 1986 to this year, when he resigned to seek election. The front-runner in the crowded 42nd District race, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieder </PERSON>, denounced <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s visit as a `` mercenary'' effort on behalf of <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, 40, whom <PERSON> North </PERSON> knew as a special assistant and senior speechwriter for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from 1981 to 1988. `` <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> is just snuggling up to <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> and president,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wieder </PERSON> said. `` What does <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> know about issues in this congressional district?'' At a news conference before <PERSON> North </PERSON> appeared Wednesday, <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> rejected suggestions that voters might react negatively to a man facing criminal charges. `` I think that if people in the district consider that <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is for me, maybe they should be too,'' he said. The candidate said he doubted voters would object to support from <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government for his role in selling arms <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and using the profits to support the Contra rebels in Marxist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>EPA Asbestos Training Program Falls Down On Job, Witnesses Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government program aimed at training contractors to remove deadly asbestos from public schools is turning out inexperienced people who can still get by with shoddy work while scoffing at health concerns, witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` We can not feel confident about the current state of contractor accreditation,'' <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, company has refused to insure 30 of the 105 government-accredited contractors seeking coverage. The accreditation program was set up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 in response to widespread reports that untrained people were doing removal work, frequently making a bad situation worse by improper procedures that filled the air with asbestos fibers that cause lung cancer. The 240 instruction centers around the nation are turning out some 2,000 inspectors and contractors monthly who are certified by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The 1986 law requires that school districts hire only certified firms and at least begin asbestos removal work by July 1989. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that some 30,000 schools could need asbestos work. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said the testimony could strengthen efforts of a sizable number of lawmakers and local school boards to amend the law to delay the mandatory asbestos removal beyond July 1989. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, school board told the subcommittee's hearing Wednesday that when he took an EPA-approved course, he encountered lackadaisical attitudes and instructors who questioned the proven dangers of asbestos fibers. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said the background of many course instructors `` is flimsy at best.'' He said there is no requirement that a contractor have any experience, meaning anyone can get into the removal business after five days of training. Even if the training is good, <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said, there is no guarantee that contractors will not try to boost profits by cutting corners because they know <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the states can not inspect all removal work. `` The programs are not tough enough,'' <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said. `` As a result of the weaknesses with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s accreditation of contractors, FEIC is essentially accrediting every contractor and approving each job the company insures.'' Kitchen said students at the course he took joked about health concerns and made comments like `` we're going to be laughing all the way to the bank.'' `` The courses themselves do not approach the subject matter in a serious way,'' he maintained. Kitchen said one principal lecturer questioned health concerns about asbestos and that students were given an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> publication that `` espouses the -LRB- asbestos -RRB- industry viewpoint that there is a safe level of exposure'' to a substance that health experts say has no safe level. Asked by <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> to comment on <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>'s letter, Assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> described it as `` disquieting.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of toxic substances, said that while the agency audits an accreditation course once, `` it is an unfortunate fact'' that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lacks the manpower to do continued monitoring.

 Dutch psychic detective <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON>, who helped authorities seek clues in the <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> family murders and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strangler </ORGANIZATION> case, died of a heart attack Wednesday, his publicist said. He was 77. <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON>, who had part of his cancerous right lung removed in April, had just left his doctor's office when he was stricken in the hallway of a medical complex near <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said publicist <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>. He was best known for helping authorities in the 1969 <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> family murders of actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and supermarket owner <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBianca </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON> reportedly told authorities the person responsible for the murders was a bearded man named <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, according to `` The Psychic World of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON>'' by <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, published in 1970. The book also detailed <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON>' involvement in the Strangler case of 1964, which later was made into a movie starring <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON> refused to budge from his position that a man he picked as the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strangler </ORGANIZATION> was the killer and that confessed strangler <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> was not, the author wrote. `` He was very helpful in any of the police things that he worked on. Why did he go into it? Because he could felt that he probably could contribute.'' Ms. <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON> reportedly became psychic in 1941 after falling from a ladder and suffering a brain injury. On regaining consciousness, he realized he had `` an ability to pierce the barriers that separate the past, present and future,'' his biography states. <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON> said he was able to see things by touching objects. `` I see pictures in my mind like a television screen. When I touch something, I can then tell what I see,'' he said. He made appearances on several television talk shows and appeared in the motion pictures `` The Amazing World of Psychic Phenomena,'' `` Mysterious Monsters,'' `` Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep'' and `` The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Strangler.'' He was the author of three books, `` Psychic,'' ` The Psychic World of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurkos </PERSON>: I Have Many Lives.'' Born in <LOCATION> Dordrecht </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, he came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1956 for psychic experiments, and lived in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area about 25 years. Surviving are his wife, <PERSON> Stephany </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON>; a daughter and six children from a previous marriage.

<HEAD>Bill Restricting Company Lie Detector Tests Clears House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation that would significantly reduce the number of lie detector tests administered by private companies now needs only <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval to go to the president for signature into law. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 251-120 on Wednesday in favor of the conference report, a compromise version of differing bills passed earlier by the two chambers. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval would send the legislation to the president. The Office of Technology Assessment estimated that about 2 million such tests were administered last year, and that 90 percent were administered by private employers, mostly to job applicants but also to workers under investigation. The accuracy of test results has been questioned, and so has the competency of some examiners. Twenty-two states prohibit the tests in the private sector, and 19 regulate their private use. The legislation would permit private sector testing of applicants for only two types of jobs. Those applying for security guard positions could still be tested, and so could prospective employees who would have direct access to the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of controlled substances. The bill also has several provisions to protect the rights of workers subject to tests. The bill would prohibit an employee from being discharged, dismissed, disciplined, discriminated against, or denied employment or promotion solely on the basis of the test, or solely for refusal to take the test. To take action against the worker, an employer would have to have additional supporting evidence. Questions on religious or political beliefs could not be asked, and all questions would have to be submitted to the examinee in writing before the examination. The examinee could end the test at any time. An employer could test an employee during an investigation involving economic loss or injury to the company. However, the employee would have to have had access to the property that is the subject of the investigation, and the employer would have to have a reasonable suspicion that the worker was involved in the incident. Before the test began, the worker would have to be given specific information about the incident under investigation. Only the federal government would be permitted to administer tests to those employed by, assigned to, or detailed to the nation's intelligence agencies and to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> contract employees. Qualification standards would be set for examiners, who would need a license granted by the state, if one was required. The examiner also would have to maintain a $ 50,000 bond. The legislation would take effect six months after it became law.

<HEAD>Navy Forecasting Job Losses at Eight Public Shipyards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is forecasting new job reductions at its eight public shipyards, where employment already has dropped 9 percent since 1985. An unpublished naval planning document shows that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is projecting a 21 percent cutback in employment at the yards between now and the end of fiscal 1991. The job figures are only estimates, and are subject to change because of schedule shifts, new work or other factors. The May 11 document, obtained this week from congressional sources, projects employment requirements based on ship repair and modernization assignments for the 1989, 1990 and 1991 fiscal years. The Naval Sea Systems Command document resulted from a recent ship scheduling conference sponsored by the systems command, which oversees the eight yards. Overall, employment in the yards would shrink from about 71,100 now to 64,050 in the fall of 1989. The workforce then would shrink further to 57,150 the next year and 56,400 the year after that. The current 71,100 figure includes about 4,000 temporary and part-time employees. The systems command, in a statement in response to a reporter's query, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has neither published employment projections nor announced layoffs `` However, shipyard employment figures are routinely reviewed and working documents are prepared to determine what employment levels are necessary to meet fleet operational requirements,'' the statement said. `` Exact naval shipyard employment figures will not be determined until the budget process is completed for fiscal year 1989 and beyond,'' it said. The eight yards have already seen their collective workforce trimmed by 7,000 from the 78,100 who were employed in January 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said those reductions were prompted in part by a declining number of ship overhauls. Some yards would see their workforce dip and then swell again, under the projections of the May 11 document. For example, employment at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, is estimated to dip from 11,400 to 8,500 by the fall of 1990, before climbing back to 10,000 the following year. Puget Sound spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrae </PERSON> said that while he was not familiar with the working document, the yard was `` pretty well aware'' of its workload over the next few years. `` I think you'll find we're not the only shipyard where you'll see some rather wide swings in manpower,'' <PERSON> Andrae </PERSON> said `` You go down for a couple of years and all of a sudden you've got to make a dramatic increase. Skilled labor does n't come easily, and that presents some challenges.'' A similar pattern was projected at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Employment at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, whose 12,700 workers make it the largest public yard, was forecast at 11,350 in the fall of 1989, 9,700 in 1990, and 10,900 in 1991 Employment at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, now at about 8,700, is projected to decline to 6,800. The yard likely would lay off 749 temporary workers first, officials said. The <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, shipyard would suffer the least disruption to its workforce, with its employment remaining between 5,000 and 5,250 during the three years. The Mare Island yard in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would see its workforce drop to 10,000 in the fall of 1989, followed by a loss of another 3,800 workers and then a gain of 1,300 to bring it back up to 7,500. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION>, which employs about 6,100 now, would drop to 4,000. Among Eastern yards, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, would go from about 8,600 to 6,200. The <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, yard would remain at about 8,000 workers until 1991, then dip to 5,800 at the end of 1991.

 A woman has given birth to a healthy child produced from a frozen embryo that was conceived in a laboratory dish with sperm from her husband and an egg donated by her sister, doctors said Wednesday. The birth in May at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and Dentistry of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is believed to be the first of its kind in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and one of 10 in the world, the doctors said. The procedure was used because the unidentified mother, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> woman in her 30s, suffered premature ovarian failure and was unable to become pregnant, said Dr. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertility </ORGANIZATION> and Reproductive Technology. Doctors retrieved several of the sister's eggs using a new ultrasound procedure that does not require surgery. The eggs were fertilized in vitro with sperm from the woman's husband. After an initial pregnancy attempt failed, the remaining embryos were frozen and kept at 190 degrees below zero Celsius. One embryo was thawed three months later and implanted, producing the healthy baby.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a published interview that two of the nation's well-known and outspoken conservatives are fringe elements whose support is n't necessary for victory in the presidential election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> at his oceanside retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Wednesday, shrugged off the influence of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, a writer and direct-mail specialist, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's only one or two that polarize, and <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> are two of them; it does n't matter in terms of total vote,'' the vice president said in the interview, published in Thursday's editions of the Times. `` There is only a handful of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigueries </PERSON> out there,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but certain Republican presidential nominee. Asked if he had to do business with <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> to win the election, he said: `` I do n't believe that.'' `` The fact that he -LRB- <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> -RRB- does n't agree with me on a lot of things or has opposed me for many years, that does n't bother me one iota,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, the vice president said, `` gets his name in the paper by criticizing other Republicans all the time.'' A <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Melenick </PERSON>, said Wednesday night that <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> would have no immediate comment on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> said last month that he would vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told the newspaper he would be meeting soon with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said over the weekend that the two had met recently, and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he would not do anything to harm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign.

 An explosion about 300 feet underground in a coal shaft Wednesday killed 31 miners and trapped 26, who were given little chance of survival. About 30 rescue workers used large drills early Thursday to bore through tons of debris in an urgent effort to reach the trapped miners. The explosion scorched the ground on the surface, where eight men were critically injured. The blast also blew the roofs off at least three work buildings at the mine, knocked down sheds and shattered windows. Early Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Hessiche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio quoted authorities as saying 31 bodies had been found, raising by 15 the number of dead that had been earlier confirmed. Twenty-six other miners were still trapped 330 feet below ground, the Frankfurt-based radio station said. <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickert </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company that owns the mine, said the latest confirmed count he'd heard was 29 dead. Rescue authorities could not be immediately reached to comment on the radio's figures. <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Milde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state interior minister, said 57 miners were in the shaft when the blast occurred at midday at the mine near <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. He said there was little hope of finding any others alive. About one-third of the men were foreigners, including 14 Turks, he said. Family members and friends of the missing men went to the mine and clung to each other for support as they waited. `` It's horrible. My husband is down there,'' said <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, 35. `` My daughters aged just 1 and 2.'' A woman who would not give her name, but said that her husband was not in the shaft, added: `` All the women in this part of town are doing their best to comfort each other.'' Around them was the mangled wreckage of the steel beams, sheds and fences blown away by the explosion. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, head of the Hesse state mining board, said all indications pointed to a gas explosion caused by a buildup of coal dust. Radio reports said the accident may have been caused by detonation of 4,400 pounds of explosives stored in the mine. The lignite coal mine belongs to <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, one of the largest West German utility companies. Mayor <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> of <PERSON> Borken </PERSON> told a news conference 16 bodies had been found. <PERSON> Milde </PERSON>, the state interior minister, said rescue workers were leaving the bodies where they found them in the shaft and moving on to search for others. Wives and children watched from nearby as workers rushed to reach the miners and pump oxygen into the shaft. Many family members were crying. Some had brought small baskets filled with food, a sign they planned for a long night of waiting. Dense smoke engulfed the area after the blast at about 12:30 p.m., half an hour before the change of shifts. Hundreds of rescue workers rushed to the mine and several helicopters were brought in. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, an engineer, said the explosion occurred at a depth of between 200 and 460 feet. It critically injured eight miners on the surface and left the ground scorched. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a miner still blackened from the explosion, said: `` I've never seen anything like it.'' He still appeared dazed. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausmann </PERSON>, a mine mechanic, said: `` I have no real hopes. I think we'll have to bury a lot of people.'' <PERSON> Hausmann </PERSON> said he was working at the pit and saw several co-workers knocked over. Late Wednesday, police spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> said he doubted earlier reports that a mine shaft had collapsed, hampering rescue efforts. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had said there was a collapse and `` this reduces the chance of finding many survivors.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Flustered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members closed a loophole in a pornography ordinance after topless dancers began smearing themselves with transparent grease to slip out of a requirement that they cover up. Before it was amended Tuesday, the ordinance specified what parts of dancers' bodies had to be covered but did n't say the covering had to be opaque. `` Some of the girls ... were covering their breasts with Vaseline or grease,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, assistant city attorney. There were reports that other dancers used see-through fabric and clear adhesive tape to skirt the ordinance. Tuesday's Council action banned all such clear coverings. The Council also amended the ordinance to make sure adult entertainment establishments are at least 1,000 feet from homes, schools, churches, parks or other adult businesses. The amendment went into effect immediately. Those who still want to see strippers can easily cross an international bridge to <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where nude dancing and prostitution are legal. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, a lawyer who represents some of the adult businesses here, said <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> simply is trying to stamp out adult businesses in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` If you comply with the first ordinance they pass, they change it to make sure no one can comply,'' he said. `` With the new definition of the type of covering, you might as well set up outside a swimming pool and charge admission to it.''

 Republican politicians say the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit has presented Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with one of his best chances yet to establish a more separate identity from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and reassure conservatives in his own party. `` There comes a time and I would say to him this is the time,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political consultant. Conservative Republicans were especially displeased with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement Wednesday that the Soviet bureaucracy _ and not policies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership _ may be the reason so many Russian dissidents are barred from leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I respectfully disagree with the president's statement,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Human rights problems are endemic to the Soviet system, not just the bureaucracy, but the fundamental nature of government.'' `` I think that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could reassure conservatives by demonstrating that he is totally realistic about the Soviets,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a consultant who worked on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984, as well as on <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s unsuccessful bid for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> near the close of his summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggested that problems Soviet citizens are having getting exit visas were caused by the bureaucracy rather than government policy. `` I just have to believe that in any government some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' said the president, apparently at pains to avoid direct criticism of his Soviet hosts. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was attempting to overcome these bureaucratic barriers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a fairly neutral tack when he was asked about the president's remarks. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which interviewed him Wednesday, asked him about it, and said in today's editions that the vice president did not respond directly. Instead, he noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have `` fundamental differences'' on human rights, and added: `` There is a long way to go before they have lived up to provisions of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> final act.'' But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> comments brought quick reaction from human rights observers as well as other politicians back home. `` It's really hard to know where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was coming from on that,'' said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, an independent policy research institute. `` The fact that there still are several hundred prisoners of conscience is not attributable to bureaucratic snafus.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the Human Rights subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, defended the president and said he thought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was trying to be polite `` I can think of no one in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the administration who feels that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s repressive policies are not the results of the repressive nature of the Soviet government,'' he said. `` I would want to give the president the benefit of the doubt.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON>'s subcommittee, said he thought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach could help open the way for loosening of Soviet emigration policy. `` That gives wriggle for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to react, and without confrontational demands,'' he said. `` I'm confident that it will work.'' But within the political community, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> comments were viewed far differently. Extreme conservatives were apoplectic. `` He's certainly become <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 apologist for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, who has taken to criticizing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for being soft toward the Soviets. `` Who is he kidding?'' asked <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` It just is n't true.'' <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments, `` Those sentiments would not really reflect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sentiments.'' He said they could give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an opportunity to demonstrate to voters an area where he and the president disagree. `` What this provides him is an opportunity to say, well, I respect the president but I ca n't find myself in agreement on those things,'' he said. `` I would tell him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB-, the opportunity is at hand, let's jump on it,'' added <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s clearly trying to be kind to his hosts,'' said Stone. `` But it's an unrealistic position.''

<HEAD>Summer Doldrums Upon Networks As Audience Levels Fall</HEAD>

 It was a poignant end to a fine series, but at least `` St. Elsewhere'' got a polite sendoff in the Nielsen ratings last week when it got its highest ranking ever, seventh. The highly publicized final episode ending with a surprise scene revealing the whole six years of the series as only the imaginings of an autistic child. But the ratings were real _ the episode got a rating of 17.0, matching the rating of the season premiere last fall, and a share of 29, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The conclusion of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s two-part movie `` Baby M'' improved on the part one, making the top 10 at fifth with a rating of 17.6 and a 27 share. Part one, included in the previous week's Nielsens, ranked 17th. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> got a top-10 performance out of the `` Miss Universe Pageant,'' which ranked ninth with a 15.6 rating. The summer doldrums began to set in last week as the network schedules filled with reruns. Viewers apparently eschewed television for the outdoors and dropped the network share of the audience to 63 from a season-to-date average of 70. Only four the top 20 shows were n't reruns. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week that ended Sunday with a 12.8 rating, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had 10.9 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 9.8. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s season-to-date average rating is 15.7, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.4 and CBS 13.2. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' continued a winning streak in news, though the three networks apparently lost early evening viewers to summer weather, and the race continued to be a virtual three-way tie. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had an average rating of 9.0 and 19 share, the `` CBS Evening News'' 8.5 and 19, the `` NBC Nightly News'' 8.2 and 18. The top 10 prime-time shows were: `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Night Court'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Baby M, Part 2'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` L.A. Law'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` St. Elsewhere'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Miss Universe Pagent'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss Special'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s made-for-TV movie, `` Desperado,'' came in 11th, the only other non-repeat in the top 20. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Bride of Boogedy,'' `` West 57th,'' `` Tour of Duty,'' `` <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON>,'' `` High Mountain Rangers,'' `` Hotel,'' `` Our House,'' `` Probe,'' `` Juarez'' and `` Omnibus.''

 Former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> says a former <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> branch manager did n't try to hide his involvement in a check-kiting scheme that led to the company's guilty plea to criminal charges in 1985 <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a defendant in a defamation suit filed by a former <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> branch manager criticized by the report he wrote, disputed the plaintiff's claim that the check overdrafting was authorized by company executives. While some branch managers said they were authorized by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> superiors to overdraw accounts, plaintiff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> never said that anybody authorized him to do that, <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> testified Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` I asked him about paying a penalty. He said he did n't think he should have to pay a penalty because he was a manager and not an account executive,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said, recalling his interview with <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, one of eight branch and regional executives cited for wrongdoing in the former attorney general's report. He quoted <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> as saying: `` Why do n't you take it out of my bonus.'' <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> claims that <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, a private attorney in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who was President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s first attorney general, negligently ignored evidence that the check kiting scheme was approved by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s top management in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, who ran branches in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, claims that <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> defamed him in the report and at a Sept. 5, 1985, press conference held to discus the findings of the three-month investigation. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was hired by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> after the firm pleaded guilty May 2, 1985, to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud stemming from the check kiting scheme. The company, now part of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay a $ 2 million fine and reimburse banks for millions of dollars in interest lost when branch offices wrote checks against money that had not been deposited in their checking accounts. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> strongly defended his investigation, saying he did n't cite any top officials for wrongdoing because all he could prove was that senior executives did n't monitor the activities of branch and regional offices. `` I thought I could catch a high person, but I never could,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> acknowledged that he was suspicious of high officials, including former <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. But there was no evidence that any top <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> official intentional sanctioned any check writing practice that was later found to be illegal, he said. `` I'm not going to put my name on something charging somebody with wrongdoing if they had n't met the test _ if they did not have the intent to do something wrong,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> testified. `` I never found anybody on a high level at <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> that knew what was going on,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. The problem was `` they did n't have any controls at all,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> `` just letting people go wild, doing whatever they wanted to do.'' He credited the investigations he and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> conducted with changing overdraft procedures of major corporations. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s report recommended that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s `` money mobilizer,'' be relieved of any duties involving the company's banking activities <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a vice president whom <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> identified as the chief financial officer, was also forced to resign for failing to keep adequate controls.

 An explosion and fire ripped through an industrial park Wednesday, killing one person, injuring at least 10 and prompting 2,000 to flee before the blaze was brought under control, authorities said. Two people were unaccounted for hours after the 3:30 p.m. explosion at <ORGANIZATION> Traco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a plastics manufacturer in this industrial northern <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, said Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Instead of mending nets and readying his boat for the salmon season, fisherman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> spends these days gathering petitions, worrying and pondering bankruptcy. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, 36, got a costly, first-hand look at the federal government's `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug program on May 11, when <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents seized his new $ 140,000 fishing boat after allegedly finding 1.7 grams of marijuana in a crewman's jacket. Today, the lanky, bespectacled boat owner is caught in a standoff with Customs officials, one he says could cost him everything he's worked for in the past 15 years and is particularly annoying because of his reputation as an opponent of drugs and alcohol in the fishing industry. `` I stand to lose it all in this deal,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said recently from his tin-sided home on a hillside above Homer. `` Everything, all $ 400,000 of my net worth.'' Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` zero tolerance'' policy, Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers have seized boats and arrested people for even tiny amounts of illegal drugs found during searches. The policy initially was applied in international waters, but after an uproar over the seizure of the $ 2.5 million yacht <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, on which less than a teaspoon of marijuana was found in international waters, the administration decided to apply the policy outside the 12-mile territorrial limit only to suspected drug smugglers. Customs officials acknowledge that <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> knew nothing of the marijuana aboard his vessel, the Hold Tight, but refuse to relinquish it until <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> pays a $ 10,000 fine and fires the crewman, who is also his nephew <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON>. `` It's outrageous. I have n't been charged with anything and here they've seized my boat, my means of production,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` I can not believe I do n't have any rights in this thing. I do n't even think this would happen in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' More than 1,000 people in this fishing community, located on the southern <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> more than 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, have signed petitions supporting <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Homer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> candidate. The Council last week passed a resolution urging Customs officials to exhibit `` some sense of proportionality'' in <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s case `` I feel the drug sellers and users should be taken on strongly,'' Councilman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosch </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't see the government telling you who to hire. I'm astounded the government would try to impose that.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON>, acting director of Customs' regulatory procedures and penalties division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, wrote in a letter to the agency's <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> office that <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> was negligent in not detecting and reporting the marijuana. `` It is our view that <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> was, as owner and master, responsible for the actions of crew members,'' <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> bought the vessel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state last November. It was delivered unfinished Feb. 1 and he says he worked 18-hour days to get the 40-foot fiberglass vessel ready for a 24-hour halibut season that started May 23. He headed for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with three crewmembers, including his 21-year-old nephew, on May 8. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said he warned the crew about the zero tolerance program. Engine problems forced the Hold Tight to stop briefly in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for repairs. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said when he routinely reported that stop to Customs agents in <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION>, his boat was searched. `` I was n't worried because I thought the boat was clean,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. But agents found the marijuana, and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> was given a summons. `` I do n't think it would have gone this far if I had yelled and screamed and fired my nephew on the spot,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` I think that's what they wanted, but my family has always stood by me, and I'm going to stand by my family.'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said he asked that his boat be released so he could make the halibut opening. `` They sat on it until the season was over,'' he said. `` I've been working for 15 years to get to that 24-hour opening and I missed it.'' That cost him a $ 40,000 catch he was counting on to pay the mortgages on the Hold Tight and his old boat, the 32-foot <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. The seizure could also cost him the $ 100,000 he expects from the salmon season, which begins in late June. He says he ca n't use the <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> to fish because he already has accepted a down payment from people intending to buy it. `` I have to fish it one way or another,'' he said. `` I have bills to pay.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will use advice he aquired in four days of issues talks to help forge policies for his general election campaign, but advisers suggest he's in no rush to spell out details. A group of economic advisers emerged from a meeting with the vice president on Wednesday with words of support for his plan for a `` flexible freeze'' on federal spending, but with few new details. The plan, designed to wipe out the budget deficit by 1993, depends on an optimistic economic outlook and a reduction in interest rates by at least 2 percentage points, participants in the session said. It would not raise taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met on Tuesday and Wednesday with the economists and held a similar session last Friday and Saturday with domestic policy advisers. He has also met with some Republican governors and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pollster and campaign strategist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> found the talks `` very helpful in formalizing his economic plans'' but is not ready at this time to further define his positions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold more such sessions back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including ones dealing with education and training programs for dislocated workers, <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said. The vice president planned to take the day off today _ with nothing on his schedule besides a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> safety check of his powerboat _ and will return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday. He has been here at his seaside vacation retreat since last Thursday. And one of the chief topics has been finding ways to project an image apart from his close identification with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ardent supporters are anxious for him to step away from the administration so the voters can see him as they -LRB- the supporters -RRB- know him'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff chief <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. `` I do n't know that that means staking out a lot of different positions as much as it means trying to communicate to voters the strengths of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a modified spending freeze won solid support from economists who advised him this week, all of whom are <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers. `` We all concluded that a flexible freeze is the right way to go, that is indeed doable,'' said former deputy treasury secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, now a consultant with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would contrast his plan with what he called the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mirage'' of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a dig at the Democratic front-runner's management of his state's economy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan depends on a reduction in the budget deficit that is occuring anyway and a fast-rising surplus in the nation's Social Security trust fund, and no downturn in economic growth, the economists conceded. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, who in the past has advocated tax increases to reduce the federal deficit, told reporters he's joined the ranks of true believers in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected, financial markets will rally on the assumption that the deficit will be attacked seriously, said <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a former chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The markets will respond and bring down interest rates another notch, 2 percentage points, and that will get us down and get us within inches of budget balance in 1993,'' said <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>. Democratic critics, as well as many private economists, argue that it is unlikely the budget deficit, $ 150 billion last year, can be eliminated without some form of new taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed `` flexible freeze'' would keep overall spending except for Social Security payments at levels in the budget approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal year 1989, plus inflation. The freeze would be `` flexible'' because some spending could go up, but it would have to be offset by identical reductions in other areas. However, so far, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not provided details on which programs he would like to cut and which ones he would like to see expanded. `` There have to be choices,'' <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> said. `` I assume the vice president is going to wait until he sits down with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate those details.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said earlier in the week that he did n't feel any `` compulsion to give 20-point programs on everyting.'' And <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, a key <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, told reporters: `` You will see in the campaign the detailed plans on how to deal with each of these issues. But the clock will not be set by those who ask the question. The clock will be set by the candidate.''

 Their faces red from weeping, relatives of the victims of the <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION> coal mine blast headed home early today after waiting for hours for news that their loved ones were alive. The news never came. By early today, rescue workers had pulled 31 bodies from the mine after the explosion midday Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Hessiche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio reported. Another 26 miners were still trapped 330 feet underground and hopes were dimming that they would be found alive. Wives, children and parents of the missing miners gathered at a mine company building Wednesday night to wait together. `` I do n't see how anyone could have survived,'' said 60-year-old <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hettmanczyk </PERSON>, whose son-in-law <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiremba </PERSON> was among the missing. He headed home late Wednesday after waiting several hours on the mine grounds. Others followed <PERSON> Hettmanczyk </PERSON>, weeping or trying to hold back their sobs. At the mine, floodlights illuminated about 300 rescue workers, who were handling large cables for drills used by teams of diggers inside. The cables also powered ventilators that were pumping fresh air into the mine shaft. The explosion blew the roofs off at least three company buildings and kicking up a dark cloud of dust that lingered over the landscape. Strewn over the site were heavy steel rollers from a conveyer belt blown apart by the blast. `` The air is very bad in there,'' said <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausmann </PERSON>, a blackened miner who was helping outside. `` Things do not look so good _ everything is blocked off.'' `` Naturally we knew that a miner's job can be dangerous. But we never thought this would happen,'' said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, an elderly man who was waiting near the mine in the house of his son <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON>, who was among the missing. `` Work will go on here after this over,'' said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a mine worker who was above ground when it happened. `` But we're never going to be able to forget this horrible disaster.

<HEAD>Record Season For Ticket Sales; Production Drops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Theatergoers gave their regards to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, buying a record number of tickets during the 1987-88 season despite having fewer productions to choose from. During the season, which ran June 1, 1987, to May 29, $ 253 million worth of tickets were sold to more than 8.1 million theatergoers, the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theaters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The previous season, ticket sales were $ 209 million and attendance hit 7 million for 40 Broadway productions. The 21 percent increase in ticket sales and 16 percent increase in attendance occurred despite a drop in the number of productions to 32 during the 1987-88 season. `` This was a more balanced season between musicals and plays,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, the league's research director. `` Last season we seemed to have three musical megahits _ ` Me and My Girl,' ` <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miserables </ORGANIZATION>' and ` Starlight Express.' That focused attention on Broadway and set us up for where we are now.'' Twelve new musicals opened during the 1987-88 season compared with 11 the previous year. `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' the <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> musical that opened with a record $ 19 million advance sale, gave the biggest boost to the season. It was joined by several other strong musical shows including `` Sarafina!'', a surprise hit from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; a revival of the Cole Porter musical `` Anything Goes,'' and `` Chess,'' a big British musical that is doing well at the box office despite mostly negative reviews. `` There's a lot of choice on Broadway which is probably why there are so many people going,'' said <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>. There were eight new plays on Broadway, down from 13 the previous season, but of the eight, only one _ `` Serious Money'' _ closed quickly. Five others are still running, including the four strong <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nominees for best play _ `` A Walk in the Woods'' by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone'' by <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, `` M. Butterfly'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON> and `` Speed-the-Plow'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>. `` The eight plays that have opened this year are the fewest number in the entire history of the Broadway theater,'' said <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Landesman </PERSON>, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway theaters. `` Granted they are of a high quality. If you feel like I do that the play is the lifeblood of the Broadway theater, that's a very worrisome statistic.'' If production was down, ticket prices were up. The $ 50 ticket for a musical is now the norm rather than the exception. A $ 40 top ticket for a play on weekend nights is also not unusual with such productions as `` M. Butterfly,'' `` Macbeth'' and `` Broadway Bound'' charging that amount. The average paid admission, according to the league, was $ 31.10, up from $ 29.86 for the previous season. <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> was optimistic about the 1988-89 season. Among the possibilities are several big musicals including `` Legs Diamond'' starring <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and a revival of `` The Merry Widow'' starring <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laine </PERSON>, as well as two <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> comedies. `` In terms of attendance, I think we will do very well because the last three weeks have been extraordinary,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` We have the momentum to keep going. A lot of that may be tourism, the weakness of the dollar. The pickup we usually get from tourism during the summer is happening earlier.'' <PERSON> Landesman </PERSON> said he wants to see theatergoers attending more than just the big musical hits like `` Phantom'' or `` Les Miserables.'' `` I'd like to see more people spread out among more productions,'' said <PERSON> Landesman </PERSON>. `` Because the producing situation is so tough now, a lot of things do n't go to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> unless they are proven or established. You want to have a situation where there are a lot of things going on _ some good, some bad and some ugly.''

<TEXT>
 With opening arguments in former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial just hours away, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was deciding today whether to let them begin. Attorneys for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, made a last-minute bid Wednesday for dismissal of charges that they concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The high court was asked to otherwise return the charges to a state grand jury or delay the trial so the justices could consider the matter further. The court was expected to issue a decision before today's scheduled start of opening arguments in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> The Mechams' attorneys argued Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the grand jury that indicted the pair Jan. 8 was lied to and was discouraged from calling witnesses or reviewing transcripts of earlier testimony. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> countered that the grand jurors were neither misled nor discouraged from seeking any information they wanted. Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who presided over the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial that resulted in the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor's impeachment, did not participate in Wednesday's proceeding <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office April 4 because of his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conviction on two unrelated impeachment charges. He faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted. Lower courts have refused previous defense motions to dismiss or remand the charges for a new determination of probable cause. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> long has contended the $ 350,000 loan in 1986 from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> was properly reported as part of a $ 465,000 lump sum that was listed as a contribution from himself. Accountant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told a lower court Tuesday he testified before the grand jury that the $ 465,000 was the only instance in which contributions from different sources on different days were lumped together on financial reports. `` That man lied before the grand jury,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keilp </PERSON>, said there were other instances in his client's `` primitive, manual bookkeeping system'' where various contributions were lumped together. <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> responded that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had said those were contributions made either from the same source or on the same day. `` There are no inaccuracies'' in <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s testimony, he said. <PERSON> Keilp </PERSON> argued there was a `` continuous pattern of prosecutorial manipulation of the jurors, misinstruction, misdirection, usurpation of power and subtle intimidation of a brand-new and inexperienced grand jury.'' He said the jurors were discouraged from reading the more than 500 pages of transcripts of testimony heard by a previous grand jury. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> told the high court that one juror asked why they had not heard testimony from <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former chief of staff, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON>. Another asked how they should go about calling a witness, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` Those questions were not answered by the prosecution. They were deflected,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> said no juror specifically asked prosecutors to call any witness.

Sixty-four percent said they approve of the death penalty, and only 29 percent disapproved, compared with 43 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval in 1985. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has no death penalty.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says his former protege, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, will be summoned to explain why he criticized the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 man, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, in interviews with Western news media. `` We in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> must ask Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and request explanations: what is he talking about and what is Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> after? It means his opinion differs from that of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the party,'' the Soviet leader said Wednesday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks continued an unprecedented public airing of discord in the Soviet leadership, which tries its best to present a unified image on domestic and foreign policy. The comments were a sensation not only for the foreign reporters who solicited them at a news conference, but also for the millions of Soviets who watched the session live on Soviet television and on tape late at night. Asked about <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s call for <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s resignation in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television interview Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` As for <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and his resignation: no such problem exists either in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or in the Politburo, and that's it. You may proceed from this assumption.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November and from the ruling Politburo in February after he made an angry speech during a meeting of the party's 300-member policy-making Central Committee. In an unexpected twist, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that he had not called for <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s resignation. `` I simply said that in the style of work of Comrade <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, there are certain aspects with which I disagree,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is true particularly on the social problems. And that was it. And there was no talk of his -LRB- <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s -RRB- departure.'' He added: `` Comrade <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is in the Politburo and I'm convinced he will stay in the Politburo, undoubtedly. In the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should step down `` because processes in the party are too slow, because the party is still lagging behind, because the process of democratization is not developing ... and <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is the main person responsible.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> forcefully sought to quell rumors of friction between himself and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, believed to head a conservative faction on the Politburo. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, 67, oversees <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideology. Responding to a question from a British journalist, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Wednesday that he had neither seen the interviews nor read a text of them. `` We plan to talk with Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> because he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered some details of the Oct. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting at which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> gave a speech leading to his ouster. Besides <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 27 other committee members spoke, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and `` the opinion of all 27 speakers was that the generalizations made by <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> regarding the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, its secretariarat and the Politburo were wrong, and his statement was recognized as being politically erroneous.'' The towering, white-haired man was fired Nov. 11 as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief, removed Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting Politburo member, and stripped May 4 of his job on the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's parliament. His current post is first deputy chairman of the State Building Committee.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have sent their <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> representatives agreements on a couple of thorny issues to serve as a catalyst for framing an arms treaty they were unable to write at the summit. One settles part of the dispute over cruise missiles carried on airplanes, the other sets the stage for keeping track of elusive mobile missiles. The two weapons would be part of a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB- to reduce overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic arsenals by 30 to 50 percent. How to verify that no weapons were hidden and retained is one of the hard-to-resolve issues still on the table. The `` substantial additional common ground'' cited in a windup summit communique included counting all existing long-range air-launched cruise missiles as nuclear weapons and distinguishing between bombers that carry them and those that do not. On mobile missiles, the two sides agreed to restrict them to designated territories so they could be counted more easily. But the dimensions of the areas were not set. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control adviser, said there was a `` lot of room'' before the issues are completely settled. And he said `` we didn ` t get anywhere'' on two other problems _ monitoring cruise missiles aboard warships and persuading the Soviets that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-missile research program can be squared with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. `` I would hope that before the year is out that we could eliminate the differences that still exist,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, although there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters `` it is still possible to sign an agreement in this administration.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Conversations are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say progress is still being made or we would n't be talking as we are.'' He has less than eight months remaining in office. And he told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the outset of their talks that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative was not on the bargaining table. Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched ahead on other arms control issues. They exchanged ratification protocols for the <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pact to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles, which was signed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. During the summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also signed two lesser arms control agreements, one requiring at least 24 hours' advance notification before ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons. On the START treaties, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had restated opposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles. `` It is the position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that such missiles should be banned unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear weapons carried by such missiles,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said in a briefing paper for reporters.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> has offered to apologize to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if an international forum determines that an expelled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was acting within diplomatic guidelines when he met an opposition leader. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that allegations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meddled in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> politics should not be allowed to harm long-term relations beween the two countries. He said his country was `` not condemning the criminal designs of an enemy, but regretting the misdemeanors of a friend.'' The tone of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s comments contrasted with the often strident rhetoric in earlier Parliament sessions. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> on Tuesday threatened to cut the number of diplomats in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> unless <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mended its ways. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, former first secretary of the embassy's political section, who the government asked to leave early last month. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> was accused of encouraging several lawyers to run against the governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the next general election. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rejected the allegations, insisting that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>'s actions were within accepted diplomatic bounds and in turn expelled a <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> diplomat of equivalent rank from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> suggested a neutral committee of three experts in international law be named to determine whether <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> and three <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials `` acted legitimately as diplomats or whether they have interfered in the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>.'' If the committee determines that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were acting with normal diplomatic guidelines, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> will withdraw its protest and apologize to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s remarks <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said his country's senior diplomats in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> say that many <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials would prefer this island republic of 2.6 million people `` move from what they consider to be an authoritarian political system, based on consensus, to a pluralistic democracy, based on a multi-party system as found in the West. `` Therefore, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have criticized <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> as not moving forward in liberalizing and democratizing as in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> ... I am only too aware of how very different we are from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> does not have one race, one language, one culture and nearly one religion.

<HEAD>Mom Sees Last Surviving Son Graduate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For years, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> has had the desire to see one of her four boys make it to graduation day. Her wish came true Wednesday night. Her only surviving son, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, received his `` completion certificate'' from <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a school for mentally and physically handicapped children. A rare disease, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s Syndrome, killed her three other sons before they could graduate. `` I'm so excited I can hardly stand it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>, who swore never to send her children to an institution after she saw the life her brother endured in one. The fatal, inherited disorder causes mental retardation and physical abnormalities such as dwarfism, deafness, heart defects and arthritic joint pain. There is no cure or therapy for the disease, which affects only males. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>, who also has the disease, is a dwarf, moderately retarded and deaf in one ear. The life expectancy of children with <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s is 15 years. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> is 18. `` He's gone against the odds already. This boy has been so close to death you could almost see it, but he's so strong,'' said his stepfather, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> died when he was 5 in 1976, followed by <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> in 1979 at age 15 and <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> in 1981 at age 18. Graduation day was a big event at the Chappels' white frame house on the city's west side. When <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> arrived home from school Wednesday, his main interest was the graduation cake. `` I want the cake now,'' he repeatedly told his mother after sitting on the couch, waiting patiently for almost two hours. Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> did n't know her first two boys had Hunter's until after <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> was born. `` I kept thinking I'll have a girl and I'll tell her not to have children. I've always wanted a lot of kids. That's been my goal since I was little,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> is not bitter. She says she feels fortunate in many ways to have been blessed with four loving boys and caring friends and relatives. `` Willie hugs me and tells me he loves me. They all have taught me so much,'' she said. Because of the disease, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> has a small esophagus, which causes difficulty in breathing. He tires easily and can walk only about a half block at a time, so she sometimes must carry him. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s future might be brief, but Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> said she'll continue doing everything she can to make him happy `` He'll be home with me until I die or he dies. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s time is my time.'' She hopes he can enroll in a day adult program for the handicapped so he can continue socializing and being around people.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kicked off his final campaign swing through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with a visit to the Watts ghetto, where he told a rally, `` I'm a man of the people.'' `` Where you struggle I will struggle,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said to a few hundred people who gathered Wednesday in <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> and cheered his every phrase. In the face of his fading prospects to win the Democratic presidential nomination, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged people to vote for him next Tuesday, the last day of the primary season. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also leaned heavily on his anti-drug, anti-violence message and themes of hope that go beyond his presidential campaign. Today, in what promised to be a dramatic encounter, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was meeting with members of the rival Crips and Bloods gangs. Campaign aides said they believed it would be the first time the rival gang leaders got together. `` As a grown man, I will never be afraid of children. I will talk with you anywhere,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the Watts rally. In his speeches Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in which the president referred to the `` primitive'' conditions in which they live and said some got rich off oil <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks ill-informed and `` an affront to all Americans.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward native Americans has lacked a key ingredient of `` profound and sustained respect `` for them. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made a mistake in saying that the lack of human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is more a matter of bureaucracy than policy. `` Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is caught up in the romance of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, not the reality,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in response to a reporter's question about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s characterization of the human rights problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during his fourth summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assessment was `` an error in his judgment.'' `` The lack of human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the lack of freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of immigration is a matter of policy, it is not just a matter of bureacracy.'' `` I hope Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will not make anymore errors of that magnitude, ` he told reporters. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was spending the night with a single mother and her three children who live in the <LOCATION> Nickerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> housing project of <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION>. ` I'm going to stay in <LOCATION> Nickerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> tonight because I'm a man of the people, ` he said.

As Tuesday's primary nears, with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> offering the largest delegate prize in the country, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign is launching its $ 700,000 TV ad blitz for the final days of the campaign, featuring four Spanish-language ads and three English ads developed for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Some of the ads began airing Tuesday, others will start today. Campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the campaign has bought $ 60,000 worth of TV and radio time for the Spanish ads, hoping to cut into the popularity front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enjoys among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s large Hispanic population. Polls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have shown <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> far behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is on the verge of sewing up the nomination, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted Wednesday that he can win the state and urged voters not to be led to thinking their vote wo n't count. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also vowed to go to the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this summer and fight for his platform goals.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus May Have Infected Human Ancestors 20 Million Years Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A predecessor of the AIDS virus could have infected primitive human ancestors more than 20 million years ago and evolved as modern humans evolved, researchers say. A determination of the entire genetic code, or sequence, of an AIDS virus found in an African green monkey suggests that the virus did not jump recently from monkeys to humans, the researchers said in an article published today in Nature, the British scientific journal. Some researchers have suggested that these monkeys may have been the source of the human AIDS virus. A team led by <PERSON> Masanori </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> found that the African green monkey AIDS virus differed from the two known human AIDS viruses in several important respects. If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times, the viruses would be identical or nearly so, said <PERSON> Carel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>, a biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>. `` It is impossible that humans were infected in any recent time with this virus,'' <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The Japanese researchers and <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> say that the evidence now suggests that each species could have its own version of the AIDS virus. Two AIDS viruses have been identified in humans. They could have evolved in isolated populations in different places, the Japanese researchers reported. Humans and monkeys are descendants of primitive primates that may have lived 20 million to 30 million years ago. The Japanese researchers believe that an AIDS-like virus infected those primitive primates. As those creatures evolved into humans and various species of monkeys, the parent AIDS virus evolved into the different forms seen today, the researchers speculated. No AIDS virus is known in apes, which are more closely related to humans than are monkeys. Dr. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Letvin </PERSON>, a primate specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said of the Japanese research, `` This is yet another piece of data in support of what I think should now be accepted _ that a jump of the virus did not occur.'' Asked why the virus has only recently been observed to cause disease, <PERSON> Letvin </PERSON> said that it could have existed for a long time only in isolated populations, and that it might also have evolved into its present disease-causing form in comparatively recent times. The virus that <PERSON> Hayami </PERSON> and his colleagues studied was isolated from a wild African green monkey obtained in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Their determination, or sequencing, of the virus's genetic code shows that it lacks some genetic material carried by the human AIDS viruses. The two human AIDS viruses are HIV-1, which is almost exclusively responsible for the worldwide epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and HIV-2, which is mostly limited to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but is now slowly beginning to spread. Researchers disagree over whether HIV-2 causes disease. The African green monkey virus lacks the so-called `` R'' gene present in HIV-1 and HIV-2, the Japanese researchers report. In addition, the African green monkey virus does not appear to make monkeys sick. Researchers are trying to determine the function of the R gene, <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today invoked an obscure Russian proverb in his farewell to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Mr. General Secretary, if you will permit me just one more proverb,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I think a very old and popular saying you have here about last Sunday, the day of our arrival, spoke to the promise we have seen fulfilled at this summit in this <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring.'' Then, in halting Russian, the president said, `` <LOCATION> Troitsa </LOCATION> _ ves les postroitsya.'' Literally, the proverb translates into English as `` Holiday of the Trinity _ and the whole forest will blossom.'' This is a reference to the old Russian Orthodox holiday of <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION>, celebrated on the last Sunday in May, and the fact that birch trees _ a symbol of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> _ are green then, auguring a good summer. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 29, the last Sunday of the month.

<HEAD>Kidney-Sharing Successful, Essential, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whether they're shipped across town or across the country, transplanted kidneys work equally well in patients following surgery, dispelling arguments that widespread organ-sharing deflates short-term success, experts say. `` The main gain is in the long term'' because of the ability to provide better-matched kidneys for patients, said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON>, professor of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. For patients extremely sensitive to donor organs, sharing is their only hope for a successful kidney transplant, said <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON>, who keeps an international kidney transplant registry. `` You ca n't find a perfect match'' unless you have access to numerous organs, he said Wednesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>. Some transplant doctors say shipping donor kidneys to the best possible candidate damages the organs because of the increased amount of time outside the body. Others, including <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON>, contend all kidneys should be shared because of the vastly improved results when the tissue of the donor and recipient is matched as closely as possible. Since last fall, the nation's transplant centers and organ procurement agencies have had to share kidneys in which all six antigens, or genetic markers, have been identified and perfectly matched with a potential recipient. The so-called `` six-antigen'' organs account, however, for only a tiny fraction of the total number of kidneys donated. <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON> said he analyzed 6,250 kidney transplants to determine whether early success rates were compromised by how far the organs were sent. Of the total, 2,338 organs remained in the hospital where they were procured and 1,422 were shared within 50 miles, <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON> said. The remaining 2,490 were sent more than 50 miles away. The transplanted kidneys that were not transported at all functioned immediately after surgery in 85.7 percent of the cases, compared with 74.4 percent of those shared within 50 miles and 83.5 percent in those sent farther, <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON> said. A year after surgery, the transplanted kidneys were functioning in 79 percent of the cases that involved no sharing, <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON> said. Seventy-eight percent of the locally shared kidneys were working properly, as well as 76 percent of the kidneys shared over greater distances. Long-term success was considerably better in kidneys that were shared and transplanted into the best-matched candidates than in those that were not shared and poorly matched, according to <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON>'s findings hopefully will end the debate over whether kidneys should be shared. `` I think the argument not to put kidneys in the patients who are the best match gets weaker and weaker. I do n't really think you can support that very much longer on scientific grounds,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. About 13,000 people are awaiting kidney transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Virtually all awaiting are on dialysis. About half are considered highly sensitive to transplants because of a previous transplant, pregnancy, blood transfusion or other circumstances that result in an unusually large amount of cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream, said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. The group includes twice as many women as men. As many as a fourth of the approximately 6,500 patients considered sensitized, in fact, are not because of an antibody known as IgM that sometimes is misidentified in blood tests as an anti-transplant substance, <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON> said. The patients consequently are passed over for kidney transplants since doctors presume their chances are poor. `` They're waiting unnecessarily,'' <PERSON> Terasaki </PERSON> said.

 Share prices closed at a record high on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today, while the dollar posted a moderate gain against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 165.45 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 27,869.36. The previous high for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s main economic barometer was set on May 17 when the Nikkei closed at 27,819.98. The index skyrocketed in early trading, momentarily touching 27,930.58, but lost momentum after investors started selling shares for profit-taking toward the end of the morning session, brokers said. `` There is growing concern for inflation and rising interest rates,'' said a broker at a major securities firm. `` The market slowed down from late morning to the early afternoon session, but it regained strength toward the end of the day's trading,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity. Volume today totaled 1.9 billion shares, with 1.3 billion traded this morning. Meanwhile, the dollar rose 0.33 yen from its 125.35-yen Wednesday finish to close at 125.68 yen. It had started the day at 125.50 yen and traded mainly between 125.48-125 .78 yen Traders said bullishness prevailed in the market throughout the day, but gains in the dollar for the past four days had investors worried. They added that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's strength against the Japanese yen has been fueled mainly through profit-taking by investors. ` Ahead of the unemployment rate release scheduled for tomorrow -LRB- Friday -RRB- in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, market players sold the yen at the current favorable rate,'' said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukuzawa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Britain Loses `Spycatcher' Case _ And A Heap Of Money With It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government today lost a two-year court battle to stop a former intelligence officer from publishing his memoirs in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and was ordered to pay an estimated $ 900,000 in legal costs. In a unanimous decision, the High Court of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> finally rejected the British government's attempt to stop publication of the book `` Spycatcher'' by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a 20-year veteran of the MI-5 counter-espionage service. Arguing that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s catch-all Official Secrets Act committed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to life-long secrecy, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also sought to seize profits from sales of the book. Unspecified legal costs, estimated by lawyers at more than $ 900,000, were awarded to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s publisher by the <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> court, which upheld lower court decisions that had all favored the publisher. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 73, was delighted and planning a `` quiet celebration'' on his horse farm in <LOCATION> Tasmania </LOCATION>, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnbull </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s deputy high commissioner in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougal </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> after the hearing: `` We still believe that a crown servant has a duty of obligation, a duty of confidentiality to the government. We are naturally disappointed.'' <PERSON> Dougal </PERSON> told the British network that it was up to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to consider whether to continue the fight in other countries. `` Spycatcher'' has been banned in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and colonial <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> by government legal action. Another hearing in the continuing fight to maintain the ban in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> takes place before <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> judges on June 13. Despite the bans, the book has sold more than 1.4 million copies worldwide and 250,000 copies in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennetto </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Octopus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which controls <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s publishers, <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today: `` When this all started almost three years ago we were worried that <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> would never see the fruit of his labors being published because he has been so ill. It is delightful that he now can.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, easily available in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in U.S.-published copies, describes how the British intelligence community bugged and burgled its way around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, snooping on individuals, politicians and foreign embassies. It alleges that right-wing intelligence officers plotted in the 1970s to destabilize the Labor government of then Prime Minister <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> that the book threatened national security, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he had n't revealed any secrets jeopardizing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> In its ruling, the court said the British government had not sought to enforce private rights or private interests in a foreign state. It said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s primary interest had been to ensure the continued secrecy of MI-5's operations and to protect national security. The judges said it was tempting to suggest that because of the close relationship between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> an exception should be made to enable <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to enforce its law in Australian courts. But, the court said, `` there are no manageable standards by which courts can resolve such an issue and its determination would inevitably present a risk of embarrassment in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s relations with other countries.''

<HEAD>U.S. Pregnancy, Abortion Rates Higher Than Many Industrialized
Countries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women have higher rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions than women in many other industrialized countries, according to a study. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based organization that examines fertility issues, also found that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women relied more on abortion and less on contraception to limit births than women in most other Western nations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women of reproductive age averaged 2.56 pregnancies and 0.76 abortions, according to the study. Only <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> showed higher pregnancy rates, at 4.33 and 3.23, respectively, among the nations studied. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> also had a higher abortion rate, 2.24, as did <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 0.80. The study, of all countries in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> plus <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, appears in the current issue of the institute's Family Planning Perspectives. The lowest pregnancy rates were in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with 1.64, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, with 1.68. The lowest abortion rates were in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with 0.15, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, with 0.18. Abortion is outlawed in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, although abortions are still relatively easy to to obtain in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the researchers said. The study found that 51.2 percent of pregnancies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1983 were unplanned, compared with 31.8 percent in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 17 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Many contraceptives used in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere are not approved for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>, vice president for research of the institute. The more contraceptive choices available, the more likely a woman will find one that she will use consistently, she said. In addition, the study found that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women are less likely to use birth control pills or intrauterine devices than women in other developed countries, Ms. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said. These are the most effective forms of birth control. The researchers said some method of contraception was used in 1982 by 54 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women between ages 15 to 44. That level ranked low, and was similar to that of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Birth control techniques used by 37 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women included pills, IUD or male or female sterilization, a `` medium'' level compared with the other countries. That ranking is largely due to the widespread use of sterilization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for women older than 30, the researchers said. The study used the most recent data available. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> abortion rates are 1983 figures.

 Powerful new X-ray beams 100 times brighter than any ever produced are not the kind your dentist would use, unless he wanted to look at the atoms in your teeth. `` These X-rays are 10 million to 100 million times more powerful than the ones used by dentists,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bienenstock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synchrotron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday as he discussed the breakthrough research. The intense, narrow beams achieved by the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> scientists, who worked with researchers from other labs, have enormous potential for medicine and industry, <PERSON> Bienenstock </PERSON> said. `` Scientists will be able to look at the structure of proteins too small for standard techniques,'' he said. `` The modern era of genetic engineering arises from our ability to determine atomic arrangements in proteins.'' The X-rays also could be used to study chemical reactions as they occur and surfaces of everyday industrial materials subject to corrosion or wear and tear. And they could be used to study superconductors and semiconductors to detect defects at the molecular level. `` Every order of magnitude in the qualities of a light source results in new, in most cases unexpected, unanticipated science,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Winick </PERSON>, deputy director of the lab. Synchrotron radiation, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by electrons forced into curved paths by magnetic fields, is the most powerful source of vacuum ultraviolet radiation and X-rays. The new X-rays, <PERSON> Winick </PERSON> said, approach the performance level anticipated for synchrotron radiation labs in design and construction in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Scientists at these labs, which are expected to be operating by 1995, hope to study the molecular structure of materials and human tissue. `` A typical size of an atom is about 100 millionths of an inch,'' <PERSON> Bienenstock </PERSON> said, `` and these X-rays allow you to see arrangements on that scale.'' The team at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, which included the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> national laboratories, and the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, achieved the new X-rays during a 12-day run last December. The results were reported recently at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The increase in X-ray brightness was reached using a bunch of electrons whipped at nearly the speed of light around a 1.3 mile ring. During the December run, the ring was operated at 7.1 billion electron volts. The scientists made the bunch extremely small with magnets that focused the electrons so the X-rays appeared to be emitted almost from a single point. The electrons were then sent through a wiggly path using magnets with alternating polarity. Each time the path wiggled the electrons gave off radiation to produce greater brightness.

 Two workers were missing today after an explosion and fire at an industrial complex killed one person, injured 10 others and caused the temporary evacuation of 2,000 residents, authorities said. The explosion occurred Wednesday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Traco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a plastics manufacturer, and the fire spread to about 20 adjoining businesses at the <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>, said fire department Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` You know how roofs blow off in the cartoons?

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped by one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most hassled embassies today, saluting diplomats and staff who have lived through a `` spy dust'' scare, Soviet bugging, alleged security breaches by Marine guards and a fire. Amid it all, the blossoming of superpower relations and the radical changes in Soviet society ushered in by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have dramatically increased the workload of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s official eyes and ears in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> An American diplomat said the embassy workers were grateful to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for taking the time to have breakfast with them and their families. `` He has these embassy visits wherever he goes, but in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in particular he's certainly aware of the unusual difficulties we've had,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition he not be identified The biggest jolt to the comfort and convenience of the folks at No. 19-23 Tchaikovsky Street came Oct. 22, 1986, when the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> retaliated for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expulsions of Soviet diplomats. It ordered 260 Soviets to stop cooking, cleaning, driving, translating and answering phones at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. Diplomats had to do their own driving, cleaning and other chores. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, the wife of then-Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, took over the gardening at her residence. `` We did what we had to do. It was n't heroic, but it is somewhat satisfying in knowing we survived it,'' recalled one diplomat who mopped floors and carried supplies around the embassy for six months. Gradually the embassy has bounced back, becoming a more efficient operation by necessity. The diplomatic staff was cut to make room for American staff support under a Soviet-imposed personnel ceiling of 225. The government brought in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, to run the embassy. It now has 84 support employees. The diplomat said the arrangement has worked well. `` The Pacific Architects and Engineers people meshed in very well,'' she said. But some officials traveling with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> say privately that the embassy diplomats remain overworked, and have n't been concentrating enough on their main duties: filing cables back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on what's going on in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They also complain that the embassy did n't prepare well enough for the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> admits the staff is having trouble coping. `` We need more hands. At a time when U.S.-Soviet contacts are exploding, the number of hands is limited by other than the personnel practices of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' he said in reference to the Soviet-imposed staff limit. The diplomats are feeling under extra pressure since <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> was succeeded by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, who is described by embassy press officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> as a `` hard taskmaster.'' The summit itself and the frequent visits by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have been an extra load on the staff, <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. `` These visits prevent us from doing what we're here for: looking at <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society and explaining it to people back home,'' he said. In addition to the withdrawal of the Soviet employees, the embassy has faced these problems in the recent years: _ In 1985, the embassy annnounced it had found traces of a chemical dubbed `` spy dust'' that Soviet agents were alleged to be using to track American diplomats It turned out the substance was not believed to be hazardous. _ Last spring, a scandal erupted over charges that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guards had allowed Soviet agents inside secret areas of the embassy Many of the charges fizzled, but Marine Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>, an embassy guard in 1985 and 1986, was convicted of espionage for giving the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> the identities of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents and the floor plans to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. _ Also last spring, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials revealed that the uncompleted $ 191 million new <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy office building was riddled with hidden <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> listening devices Government investigation panels have recommended the top floors of the building be stripped off. _ Fire broke out Feb. 17 in an unoccupied fifth-floor residential section of the aging main office building Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen who inspected the building in April of last year had called it a `` firetrap and unsafe by accepted standards for general working conditions.'' _ And, off and on for 25 years, the Soviets have bombarded the embassy with microwave radiation Despite intense investigation, no one in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government is willing to say whether the purpose is espionage, interference with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence-gathering operations, or an attempt to affect the health, minds or behavior of Americans working in the embassy. Low-power microwave signals continue to be detected.

<TEXT>
 The wife of a clothing store owner was trying to call her husband about cracks she'd noticed in the walls and windows when the 136-year-old brick building collapsed around her. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who was the only person in the four-story <ORGANIZATION> Larry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> building when it collapsed Wednesday evening, suffered only bumps and bruises, authorities said. She escaped by crawling through what had been a storefront display window. `` I was talking to my son on the phone, trying to find out where <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> was when it happened,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said. `` I thought I was dead; it's awful to think you're dead.'' The collapse tore down power lines, sparking a fire that spewed heavy smoke and forced the evacuation of more than 100 residents within three blocks of the building in this east-central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city of 28,500 residents. The evacuees, many of whom were taken to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> center, were allowed to go home early this morning. Police today said the cause of the collapse had not been determined. Before the collapse, bystanders heard glass breaking in the building and told police, who notified Mrs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, who was in a law office across the street, said she saw Mrs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> enter the building. Just then, a tractor-trailer rig rolled past and the building fell apart, Ms. <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. The sides of the structure and part of the front crumbled, while the back wall remained standing. `` It's amazing that she's alive,'' Ms. <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. The clothing store building was built in 1852. There was no immediate estimate of the cost of the damage. The building was purchased in 1974 for $ 37,500, the family said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, son of the Wades, said the building contained offices on the second floor and a basketball court on the fourth floor. He said the third floor `` did n't have much of anything.''

It was unclear where she received the drug, but her psychiatrist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> was authorized to dispense it, the drug manufacturer said. On May 20, Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30, walked into the <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, shot a boy in the bathroom and then entered a 2nd-grade classroom and shot five other youngsters. She fled the school and entered a nearby home where she shot a 20-year-old man who tried to seize the gun. Later, as police surrounded the house in the posh suburb, Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> killed herself. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> manufacturer of <LOCATION> Anafrail </LOCATION>, said tests of the drug were being conducted with government approval on 1,300 adult patients at 21 centers around the country. The company has been selling the drug outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for treatment of people suffering from `` obsessive-compulsive disorders,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said. `` Carried to the extreme, some people spend eight hours in the shower,'' she said, noting the drug also is used to check `` repetitive thoughts of random violence.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> exhibited various symptoms of the disorder during the last few years. Residents of an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where she once lived said Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> often rode the elevator for hours. Ms. <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said the Madison psychiatrist who was treating Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, was participating in tests of the drug at a university clinic. She said the drug was effective during the first phase of testing that ended in December, but statistical reports were still being compiled.

 A federal judge early today denied a request that he release an anti-communist Cuban-American who was convicted in this country as a terrorist but is considered a hero by opponents of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s petition for parole after reviewing more than 700 classified and unclassified documents <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> made no mention of his proposal Wednesday that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> be released from jail and put under house arrest pending a government decision on whether to expel him. The proposal drew immediate opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The judge said today that the government has a `` legitimate and bona fide reason'' wanting to expel <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>. `` The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the attorney general has acted in bad faith,'' he ruled. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> has been in jail since February, when he returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Israeli human rights activists accuse their nation's soldiers of systematic brutality in the occupied lands and say such tactics are prolonging the six-month-old Palestinian uprising. In one case, an Arab resident of this isolated village said soldiers pelted him with rocks for two hours last month as he sat handcuffed in a pit. Two hand-sized spots of dried blood were visible in the pit several days later. In another village, Arabs alleged troops forced them to remove roadblocks as they tried to evacuate a 15-year-old shot by soldiers in a clash _ intentionally wasting crucial minutes of the boy's life The youth died the same day. In a third case, a 70-year-old man claimed troops threw him into a 12-foot-deep well in his garden and closed the lid. The man, who suffered sprained ankles and a fractured lower back, said he sat in two feet of cold water for six hours before being rescued. The army said initial investigations proved the allegations in all three cases to be unfounded, adding that soldiers were cleared of wrong-doing. Army officials acknowledged that some soldiers have brutalized Palestinians, but described these cases as `` exceptions.'' Parliament member <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citzens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> disagrees: `` There are too many cases to describe them as exceptions.'' Such incidents, he said this week, deeply affect the Palestinians. He quoted an unnamed senior defense official as telling legislators `` harassment and maltreatment by soldiers'' were to blame for prolonging unrest. Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been protesting Israeli rule since Dec 8. More than 200 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in the upheaval. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to check 10 complaints, including three in which troops are accused of beating Arabs to death in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> have forwarded 17 complaints, mainly concerning brutality. Neither received detailed responses, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is now reviewing army and police investigation methods. One widely publicized case occurred May 18 during an army raid of <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 23, said he was arrested and handcuffed in nearby hills, where soldiers placed him and two other villagers into four-foot-deep stone pits. `` There were about 20 to 25 soldiers who pelted me and the others with stones,'' he said in an interview at his home. After two hours, a soldier yanked him up by his hair when he could n't stand up because most of his body was covered by stones, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Farradni </PERSON>, a doctor at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> who examined <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> later that day, said the man's face, legs and waist were swollen and covered with bruises. Army officials said an initial check showed no wrongdoing by soldiers, but that an official inquiry was launched after Arabs filed formal complaints. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military commander, visited <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION> today, where he questioned two of the Palestinians who said they were pelted, army radio said. The radio said <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> declined to comment after he spoke to the villagers saying `` the appropriate conclusions will be drawn by army investigators.'' In another case, Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Azmut </LOCATION> claimed soldiers on May 16 purposely delayed evacuation of <PERSON> Alaa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thabet </PERSON>, 15, after he was shot in the neck during a protest. Villager <PERSON> Murad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, 25, was quoted by the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying soldiers forced him and others transporting the youth to remove roadblocks, delaying the group for 15 minutes. Soldiers then allegedly took over the car to drive the wounded youth to a military base near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, where no one paid attention to Thabet for more than a half-hour, <PERSON> Amer </PERSON> was quoted as saying. An army spokeswoman said `` no more than 10 minutes passed from the time the officer got into the car until an army doctor saw the boy.'' But she added that the boy was dead on arrival. The spokeswoman said Azmut residents told army investigators the delay was caused while villagers searched for a car to evacuate <PERSON> Thabet </PERSON>. She denied that soldiers forced those evacuating the youth to remove roadblocks. The third incident took place April 26 in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, also in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Subhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yussef </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrad </PERSON>, 70, said soldiers threw him in a well while he was irrigating his garden at dawn. Jarrad was interviewed lying on a cot in his home, a brace around his lower back and a bandage around his right foot. A doctor who treated <PERSON> Jarrad </PERSON> said the injuries suggested the man was thrown because there were no scratches on his skin. The army said no soldiers were in the area at the time. But an official said <PERSON> Jarrad </PERSON>'s family was involved in a feud and `` certain evidence points to young men from another clan.'' Army officials denied allegations they are not investigating such claims of brutality. `` Many cases are difficult to investigate. There are not enough facts, not enough witnesses,'' said an army spokeswoman. `` A lot of Palestinians talk to journalists, but then are not willing to stand behind the story and to talk to investigators.'' Some allegations have proved false, as well. In one case, relatives of 5-year-old <PERSON> Yasmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> claimed soldiers threw boiling water on her during a Jan. 13 raid of the family's home in the <LOCATION> Bureij </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Yasmine </ORGANIZATION>'s mother later told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the girl's cousin accidently dropped the water on her when he became frightened during the raid

 Rain-sodden residents began clearing muck and debris and repairing flood damage to their homes after a 4 -LCB- - foot wall of water burst through an earthen dam, forcing about 60 people to evacuate The heavy thunderstorms dropped up to 14 inches of rain on Comanche on Tuesday and early Wednesday, flooding the north-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town, briefly shutting down some highways and obliterating the dam on 100-acre <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eanes </LOCATION>. The town's 4,100 residents were told they could return to their homes Wednesday morning. The sun came out Wednesday afternoon while residents picked through the muddy debris. `` We've lived here 22 years, and it's never gotten this high before,'' said <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, 40. `` It came up to the porch only one other time.'' The flood emergency was over by Wednesday night, said <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carouth </PERSON> of the Comanche County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> pointed to grass and mud stains 4 -LCB- feet high on the white wals of her home, which lies on Indian <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> downstream from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eanes </LOCATION>. She estimated about $ 30,000 damage to her house. Mrs. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> said she and her 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, ran up a hill to the home of <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadelle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Eanes </PERSON>' owner, around 3 a.m., near the flood's apex. About two hours later, she said, water surged through the middle of the earthen dam, which was built in the 1930s. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Eanes </PERSON> was completely drained. The dam on Lake Comanche, which is downstream from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eanes </LOCATION>, held but water spilled over its lip, said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where about 60 residents stayed until the floodwaters subsided. Full damage estimates were not available. As much as $ 100,000 in inventory at Comanche Carpet and Tile was ruined by the floodwaters, said owner <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` I do n't know what we're going to do yet,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said North along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 377, the floodwaters blocked several underpasses and bridges with logs and other debris. The driver of a tractor-trailer rig reportedly swam to safety as floodwaters washed his truck off the road.

<HEAD>Sex Offender Submits to Court-Ordered AIDS Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convicted sex offender could face a more severe sentence if he tests positive for the AIDS virus after the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to overturn a lower court ruling requiring the test, a prosecutor said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, a 34-year-old former flight attendant, took the test Wednesday. He was convicted in April of two counts of patronizing a juvenile male prostitute and two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor. Deputy Prosecutor <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> contended that Farmer knew he had tested positive for the virus when he had contact with the two prostitutes, including sexual intercourse with one of them. Jurors who convicted Farmer were not told he was believed to have the virus for acquired immune defiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system and can be transmitted through sexual intercourse. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> upheld a May 24 <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that Farmer submit to the test before his sentencing Tuesday. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said there was a legitimate concern that Farmer, who is on court-supervised release, would continue to engage in the same sexual conduct. Defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Iaria </PERSON> appealed <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' decision, but a three-judge appeals panel later upheld the ruling. By court order, the test results will not be made public. But Ms. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> has said that if Farmer tests positive for the virus, she would use that information to argue that <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>'s conduct is an aggravating factor that warrants a 10-year sentence. The standard sentencing range is between two years, seven months and three years, seven months. <PERSON> Iaria </PERSON> argued the test would violate a state law barring mandatory tests for the AIDS virus. However, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said the law limits health officials, not judges. Joining <PERSON> Iaria </PERSON>'s attempt to block the order were the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State Privacy Lobby.

<HEAD>Soviet Reporters Nudge Gorbachev Into Talk About Past Taboos
^An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, prodded by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists at his first <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference, touched on subjects once taboo _ past <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> intransigence at arms control talks and the pain endured by mothers of Soviet boys missing in action from the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with the local press on Wednesday was an illustration of the effects of `` glasnost,'' or openness, on the state-run media, which have traditionally served to embrace official policy and spread it to the masses. Soviet newspapers and the journalists who work for them are far from challengers or adversaries of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s encouragement of the Soviet press to take a closer look at the nation's problems, in hopes of speeding their resolution, has taken hold and changed the relationship between the press and the leadership it serves. It would have been unthinkable before the current reforms were introduced in early 1985 for a Soviet journalist to even mention the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at such a public forum. When a correspondent for the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> rose to address <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he asked about the fate of 300 Soviet soldiers reportedly taken prisoner by Afghan rebels and forced into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Without as much as a flicker of discomfort, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded with the sincerity of a concerned father that `` we will do everything so that our people return home.'' The most delicate questions were posed by foreign reporters, who outnumbered the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists at the exchange by at least two to one.

The press conference format was looser and the selection of questioners more random than at White House press conferences, where the seating and start of questioning is pre-ordained. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deftly handled even the most sensitive queries about his relationship with Kremlin ideologist <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, with whom he is reputed to be in dispute about the pace of reforms, and the inflammatory remarks of <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief who on Monday called for <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s resignation. The five Soviet journalists selected to pose questions asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conservatives hesitant to improve superpower relations, the shift from Soviet to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foot-dragging on arms control, the relationship <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will have with the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president and the voice each nation's people have in forming foreign policy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> misunderstood a question by <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> magazine's <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berezhkov </PERSON>, a former diplomat and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs expert whose experience dates back to the leadership of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berezhkov </PERSON> served as a translator at the 1945 <LOCATION> Yalta </LOCATION> conference. `` I tried during my latest meeting with media representatives to talk about the power of conservatives,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began, but was interrupted with a whisper from Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` You mean you're talking not about our conservatives, but THEIR conservatives?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Berezhkov </PERSON>, prompting laughter throughout the auditorium. <PERSON> Melor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> correspondent who reported from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until he was expelled in 1983 in a tit-for-tat exchange, acknowledged in his question that the verification issues being considered by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms negotiators were initially hampered by the Soviet side. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed with his assessment, and went on to criticize the current problems as a result of American stubbornness, but qualified his remarks by warning listeners not to `` spoil your impressions'' of the summit's overall success. The Soviet leader declared the press session _ the first such meeting here approximating a White House press conference _ a useful event, hinting that other exchanges could be offered in the future.

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says his family is disturbed by the decision to establish a museum in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> building from which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> is believed to have shot President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said family members will not try to block the opening of the $ 3.5 million exhibit on his brother's 1963 assassination `` The familiy has taken the position that the only memorial should be the Kennedy Library -LRB- in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> -RRB-, with its outreach capabilities in terms of inspiring people to service,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> museum is expected to open by Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of the assassination. Organizers say the museum will allow the thousands of tourists who visit the site to have access to the former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION> building. Organizer <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> described the exhibit as `` low-key'' and said it will not contain `` violent or gruesome artifacts.'' The sixth-floor corner window from which <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was believed to have fired the shots will be inaccessable, but visitors will be able to see it through a glass partition, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` People are in <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> Plaza 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year and there is no place for them to get information,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` This is especially a problem with our international visitors. They expect <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to have access to its history, good or bad. They consider it an integral part of a democracy.'' Planners expect the exhibits to attract about 500,000 visitors annually. The museum, called `` The Sixth Floor,'' was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> determined that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> fired at Kennedy from the sixth floor of what is now the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administration Building.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 130,000 unionized engineers, technicians and humanities and social science graduates went on strike today, disrupting the country's airports, industrial plants and universities. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run radio and television halted broadcasts and the only station operating was <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The 24-hour strike of the three unions was announced last week and started as scheduled at midnight.

He said electricity supply would be maintained. Also affected were the national telephone company and the post service.

He termed the accord `` a real breakthrough.'' He said it stipulated a unified wage increase for all the unions, which would then be free to decide how to distribute the increase to their members.

 Armenian activists have been protesting around the clock in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital and staging a general strike in a region in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that they want annexed to their republic, an organizer said. The Soviet government, meanwhile, canceled a state-sponsored press trip to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> without giving a reason. The ethnic strife-torn southern region is closed to foreigners. And in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION> reported that Armenian emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is headed for an all-time high in 1988 following a new sharp increase in May. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the committee, said 5,305 Armenians have been allowed to leave since January, including 1,501 in May alone. This compares with a total of 6,633 departures in 1980, the highest total since 1977, when the committee began monitoring the family reunification program financed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Former political prisoner <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Homizuri </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Wednesday that demonstrators had for six days staged a sit-in outside the city's Opera Theater. They are demanding that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an Armenian-dominated region in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, be turned over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> Ethnic Azeris are predominantly Moslem, while most Armenians are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have been demonstrating day and night, rain or shine,'' said <PERSON> Homizuri </PERSON>, 46, who was released in February 1987 after spending four years in a labor camp for his writings circulated in the intellectual underground. <PERSON> Homizuri </PERSON> said the demonstrators want the parliament of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the Supreme Soviet, to consider their demand at a June 15 meeting. In <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a general strike that has shut down mass transit and factories for about a week continued, according to <LOCATION> Homizuri </LOCATION>. Intourist, the Soviet travel agency for foreigners, advertised a special trip to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> for reporters covering this week's summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The trip, scheduled from Friday to Monday, was to have been the first opportunity for foreign journalists to visit the troubled region since demonstrations and rioting broke out. On Wednesday, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> carried a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announcement that said the trip was canceled. It gave no reason. Strikes and street rallies began in the region in February and broke out again recently. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the former party chief in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, where ethnic rioting related to the territorial dispute killed 32 people in February, had been expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Also dismissed from the organization was the former party chief in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost'' has brought more open discussion of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s problems, but foreign reporters frequently have found their access to troubled regions cut off, either through disruption of telephone calls or travel bans.

<TEXT>
 Reporters have an absolute right not to reveal confidential sources during legal proceedings, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in throwing out a $ 4.5 million libel judgment against The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. The unanimous opinion filed Tuesday lets stand a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that reaffirmed <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Shield Law and reversed a 1983 verdict won by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>, a lawyer and former first assistant district attorney in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the lower court's ruling that <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s libel suit against the Inquirer be retried The suit involves several 1973 articles that reported allegations of Sprague participating in an illegal wiretapping scheme. Other articles raised questions about whether <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>, as chief of the homicide division of the district attorney's office in 1963, extended preferential treatment to the son of former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Urella </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> in a homicide case. <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> denied both sets of allegations. During a six-week trial in 1983, Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> ruled the jury had to disregard any evidence presented by the Inquirer based on confidential sources. Rather than divulge the reporters' sources, the newspapers' attorneys chose not to present the evidence The Shield Law, enacted in 1937, states that no reporter `` shall be required to disclose the source of any information procured or obtained by such person, in any legal proceeding, trial or investigation before any government unit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986 that the Shield Law gave the newspaper the statutory right to withhold the identity of its sources, and ordered a new trial. Writing for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the Shield Law's language `` is in no way ambiguous'' and agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that Lord had committed an error by barring the Inquirer's evidence. However, <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> differed with the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s broad interpretation of the law, saying that just because evidence based on confidential sources is admitted does n't mean its reliability is guaranteed. `` The plaintiff is free to introduce rebuttal evidence and-or argue that the record does not disclose any evidence to support the reliability of the information,'' <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> wrote.

 A man arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old claims to have molested 200 to 300 children in the past 20 years, police said. Law enforcement agencies in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area are investigating the claims made by <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 44, police in this <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was arrested May 19 on charges of sexually assaulting a girl in a vehicle in his garage April 12 after the child wandered into the yard where he and his wife were working, police said. He was freed on $ 5,000 bail. In a statement to police, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a machine operator for a bottling company, said he molested 3 - to 8-year-old boys and girls throughout the metropolitan area, mostly in toy departments of large stores, police said `` He would look for a child left alone, approach them, strike up a conversation and then fondle them,'' said Detective Jan Brace. `` He estimated between 200 and 300. ... There could be more. That was strictly an estimate.'' Police said they believe many of the cases in which <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> claims to have been involved never were reported. `` It is not unusual that small children would n't have told anyone about these incidents because of fear,'' <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> had two previous arrests. In 1979 he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman, and in 1981 he was accused of harassing a 4-year-old girl, records showed. The outcome of that case could not immediately be determined.

<TEXT>
 The use of asbestos to make silver jewelry and whiten moccasins for ceremonial dances is responsible for an outbreak of a rare form of lung cancer among New Mexican Indians, doctors report today. Doctors from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> began an investigation after finding that the incidence of malignant mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer associated with asbestos, was 1,000 times higher than expected at one Indian pueblo.

Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON> and other researchers reported their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine. Four of the victims were silversmiths. The researchers found that they typically used asbestos mats, which they called pounding boards, to insulate their work tables against the heat of torches and molten metal. All five also participated in ceremonial dances. Before the dances, the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> used asbestos to whiten their buckskin leggings and moccasins. The researchers said efforts have been made to educate Indians about the hazards of asbestos and to find alternative materials for silversmiths and ceremonial dancers.

The electrical cooperative's eight-member board voted unanimously to withhold its June 1 payment of $ 1.6 million toward building and maintaining the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> project. The cooperative said the strain the project has put on relations with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has hurt customers. The cooperative comprises 34 municipal electric systems, and supplies power to 28 electric departments in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and eight in other Northeast states. The action came less than a week after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state reached an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to abandon the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant, which also has never gone into commercial operation. It `` reflects the bottom-line reality that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is a teetering financial dinosaur about to become extinct,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., a <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> opponent `` I believe there's a major funding problem for the project and it is so grossly uneconomic right now that this may be the end of it,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Seacoast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought the project since its inception. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> disagreed. `` Our detractors have said from the beginning that each hurdle we face has meant the end of the project, and each time they have been wrong,'' he said. `` The rest of the owners remain committed and the bottom line remains the plant is very much needed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' However, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s top three owners indicated that they would n't pick up the cooperative's share. One, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, has filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> has a 36 percent share. United Illuminating of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has a 17.5 percent piece and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has 12 percent. Under a plan approved by the board, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> cooperative plans to ask the other owners to assume its construction and maintenance costs or to buy its shares outright under the joint ownership agreement. The matter could come to a head in eight months, when the grace period for overdue bills is up and the other investors exhaust the money the cooperative has deposited in a prepayment fund. General Manager <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> acknowledged that cooperative would lose the $ 875 million it has already invested in the plant, which cost $ 5.4 billion to build but lacks the approved evacuation plans required for commercial operation. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> also acknowledged that the cooperative could be paying off the bonds issued for the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> investment for the next 30 years. The cooperative will pay $ 91 million yearly for its long-term <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> debt in 1989 and $ 15 million to $ 20 million annually to support the idle plant. But he said the project was a losing business proposition even if the plant's license is eventually approved. `` The alienation that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has caused between <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> -RRB- has had adverse consequences for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> public power electric consumers.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has refused to authorize tax-exempt financing for the project, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. Hunt predicted `` serious rate increases for some participants on top of the participants' already high rate levels caused by <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>.''

 More than a third of 1,023 patients treated at a hospital for serious accidents used marijuana before being injured, according to a study. Another third of the patients at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>'s Shock Trauma Center drank alcohol before being hurt, and 16.5 percent had used both marijuana and alcohol, the study said `` To me, it was rather startling to see that an illicit drug matched in use by a legal drug,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON>, a surgeon who headed the research project at the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. Patients were unaware of the study, which used blood samples. The research was reported in the June issue of the journal <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgery </ORGANIZATION>. `` If this is borne out in other studies across the country, it puts a new slant on the safety of marijuana use,'' Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cone </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` There's a common misconception that marijuana is a safe drug,'' <PERSON> Cone </PERSON> said. `` But the statistics coming out of that study clearly show that people who are using marijuana are involved in accidents at a much higher rate than you would expect.'' <PERSON> Cone </PERSON> said the incidence of marijuana use among the injured was `` phenomenally high.'' The study showed that 34.7 percent of the 1,023 patients had used marijuana and 33.5 percent were under the influence of alcohol. Ninety-two percent of the patients survived. About two-thirds of the patients were involved in traffic accidents. The rest were injured in assaults or falls and other accidents. About 73 percent were men and 58.4 percent were 30 or younger.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview published today that two of the nation's well-known and outspoken conservatives are fringe elements whose support is n't necessary for victory in the presidential election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> at his oceanside retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Wednesday, shrugged off the influence of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, a writer and direct-mail specialist, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's only one or two that polarize, and <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> are two of them; it does n't matter in terms of total vote,'' the vice president said in the interview, published in today's editions of the Times. `` There is only a handful of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigueries </PERSON> out there,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but certain Republican presidential nominee. Asked if he had to do business with <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> to win the election, he said: `` I do n't believe that. `` The fact that he -LRB- <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> -RRB- does n't agree with me on a lot of things or has opposed me for many years, that does n't bother me one iota,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, the vice president said, `` gets his name in the paper by criticizing other Republicans all the time.'' `` If he wants to go around attacking conservatives he's going to dig himself a deeper hole,'' <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> said early today in response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments. `` I want all of us to unite behind him and run a conservative campaign. ... All we want to do is hold his feet to the fire that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lit in 1980. `` If he does n't run a polarizing election, he's history. ... If he does n't run a campaign to polarize, that polarizes the country along liberal and conservative lines then he has no chance of winning,'' <PERSON> Vigurie </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, who said he plans to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was reacting to presssure that he select a conservative as his vice presidential running mate. `` I suspect the vice president doesnt' feel comfortable with pressure to campaign as a conservative,'' he said. `` I'm sure the conservatives will be insistent on a conservative vice president and a conservative platform,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s car was hit in a brief exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a Christian militia patrol in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, but the envoy was not hurt, police said. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said only one bullet hit the hood of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s armor-plated limousine The spokesman said the shooting occurred when <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s bodyguards in two escort cars fired in the air with automatic rifles, `` apparently to make way for the ambassador's convoy'' in a traffic-jammed street in the Sin Fil neighborhood. The ambassador's motorcade was heading for the heavily guarded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound in the suburb of <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION>. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was in a dark blue bullet-proof limousine driving between the two escort vehicles. A militia patrol from President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was in the area, `` opened fire in the air, too, in an effort to stop <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s convoy to check what was happening,'' the spokesman said. `` <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s bodyguards fired three bullets at the Phalangists in a white Mercedes-Benz and the patrol fired back,'' the spokesman said. `` <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s car was hit by one bullet in the hood and the convoy continued on its way to the embassy,'' the spokesman added. He did not elaborate. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: `` The ambassador and all his escorts are fine.'' He refused to elaborate. In another development, police said three members of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, were wounded in a brief firefight with rival Shiite Moslem of the Syrian-aided Amal militia in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. A police spokesman said the five-minute firefight in the <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district ended when Syrian troops intervened. The clash was the first reported between the two sides since <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed 2,400 soldiers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums on Friday and Saturday to end three weeks of street battles between the two militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded. Amal accused <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> of provoking the clash and said the three wounded militiamen were armed with silencer-equipped pistols. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said Amal militiamen opened fire on the three `` unarmed'' Hezbollahis as they drove to Shiyah to check on their apartments.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> challenged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at their windup summit meeting over the wording of the final communique, and they were `` going at it pretty heavy until the end,'' White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> revealed today. Talking with reporters on the president's plane as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also pronounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation satisfied with the results of the summit, which concluded Wednesday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further on arms control, but added, `` We came out just about where it was predicted we could come out. It would have been nice if we could have gone any further, but nobody expected us to go any further.'' Asked why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared so fatigued over the past couple days, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` We're all tired, I guess, but most of us are more tired than he is. I do n't think that fatigue played any role in the summit.'' `` I'm sure he's tired and I guess he looks tired,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said of the president. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> described <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a strong leader and said he demonstrated the same image in private as he did at his nearly two-hour news conference, where he was feisty and appeared entirely in command. In talks with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` goes on at some length but he does not filibuster. He says what he says and he does n't back up and say, ` I meant to say so and so,''' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recalled. `` He comes out of the box saying what he meant,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Unlike earlier summits, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not share with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> his store of jokes about life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` He told him some lawyer jokes and I did n't like that,'' joked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an attorney. He described the scene at the final Reagan-Gorbachev meeting on Wednesday morning, about six hours before the summit communique was released to the press: `` As the meeting ended, all of us stood up, including the president and the general secretary, and the president and general secretary continued to pursue their conversation. `` They were going at it pretty heavy and I was proud of the president. They were face to face and going at it pretty heavy until the end.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> explained that at the first meeting, on Sunday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> some papers describing items that he wanted to discuss over the next three days. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the president gave it only a cursory look, and that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> quoted a phrase from the documents about `` peaceful coexistence.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said something like, `` that looks all right to me,'' and the documents were passed on for review by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s document would have put the two leaders on record as believing that `` no problem in dispute can be resolved, nor should it be resolved, by military means. They regard peaceful coexistence as a universal principle of international relations. `` Equality of all states, non-interference in internal affairs and freedom of socio-political choice must be recognized as the inalienable and mandatory standards of international relations,'' the Soviet draft said. At his <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked why he took issue with the `` peaceful coexistence'' language. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he liked `` the whole tone'' of the draft language. But the president also said that aides studying the draft communique `` saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in there that would not achieve the general thought of what was being proposed.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were suspicious about the language, feeling it was too imprecise. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections were brought to the attention of the Soviets early on, and negotiations began at the staff level on alternative language, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` And indeed, it was our impression that alternative language had been agreed to for the departure statement,'' he said. `` And it was at the last meeting -LRB- that -RRB- the general secretary came back and made another run at trying to get his original language in. And the president held his ground.'' `` I do n't think he -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- was playing a trick. I think he was just making a run for his original formulation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In the end, the compromise language negotiated by the staff _ omitting the words peaceful coexistence _ was included in the communique. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were `` more free-flowing'' than in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and that there was `` more energy in the conversations.'' `` They talk more freely. When they disagreed they would say so more quickly,'' he added.

 European newspapers today declared the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit a success despite the absence of major advances on arms control. Editorialists applauded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s performance and his disavowal of his earlier characterization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as `` an evil empire.'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> sent a message of thanks to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after five days of summit talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Norwegian Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said in a statement: `` With this fourth summit and the signing of the INF -LRB- intermediate-range nuclear missile -RRB- treaty, we are facing a historic watershed in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and international postwar history.'' `` We have ahead of us a radically changed picture, both in dialogue and in climate, between the two superpowers. What has happened now makes new breakthroughs possible in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> cooperation,'' <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said. Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> historian, wrote of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>: `` It has been a brilliant performance. ... He is truly a remarkable man, and his place in history is certainly assured.'' Also in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the left-leaning Guardian commented: `` There's a pretty durable foundation of contact in place.'' It said: `` When Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in another era, talks of evil empires and builds policies based on fear and mistrust, then his voters, to an extent, share that fear and mistrust, believe that the Russians are coming to get them. `` Such beliefs ca n't easily be sustained when their front-parlor screens are filled by those same Russians -LRB- not to mention the newly converted Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- expressing quite other sentiments.'' <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, differed with the Guardian. `` Things did not go well for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. ... One could clearly see he was disappointed, very disappointed. ... The ideological disparity between the two camps surfaced more clearly in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than in the previous summits,'' it said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the leftist daily <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> said: `` <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have but very thin concrete results to add to the essential dossiers of disarmament and regional conflicts.'' But it said, `` This ` routine' summit was nevertheless not ordinary. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who just several years ago could be imagined as Saint <PERSON> George </PERSON> slaying the Red Dragon of the Evil Empire, made a skillful crossing to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> which he was visiting for the first time. `` ... <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew how to suppress his first-class anti-communist image. ... -LRB- But -RRB- at the end of the summit, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief was unable to hide the fact that he was waiting for more,'' Liberation said. The conservative <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> said: `` The success of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit is paradoxically that it did not have major results. ... This rendezvous appears to have confirmed that American-Soviet relations have found their cruising rhythm ...'' The <PERSON> Basler </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>, an independent Swiss paper, said: `` It ushered in a new kind of coexistence which has deservedly been celebrated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ... `` The old coexistence was ... a highly unpredictable matter full of political misunderstandings, full of nuclear risks. The new coexistence is to be different: calculable, solid, crisis-resistant.''

The unit, formed to assist in persecuting and killing people considered racially undesirable or enemies of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, murdered tens of thousands, said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Special Investigations. The founder, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Arajs </PERSON>, died recently in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> while serving a life term for mass murder. Assisting in persecution makes a person ineligible to immigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and requires revocation of citizenship. The denaturalization case against <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> is the first step in a process that could lead to deportation. A native of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1950 and became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1956. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> is now part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON>' apartment complex, said <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> lived alone, never caused problems, paid his rent on time and was `` very gregarious.'' Didrichsons recently underwent surgery for cancer, <PERSON> Berzins </PERSON> said, adding that he was awaiting medical records to determine the seriousness of the illness. <PERSON> Berzins </PERSON> said it is difficult to view <ORGANIZATION> Arajs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kommando </ORGANIZATION> in its historical setting 45 years later. He noted that in 1941 and 1942, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were fighting in what was then a neutral country that had been occupied by the Soviets. `` People pull strings and jump or face execution themselves,'' he said. `` Certainly the free choice of a person at that time is severely impacted.'' <PERSON> Konrads </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who is now on trial in a similar proceeding, and <PERSON> Mikelis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirsteins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is facing trial, served with <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> in the auxiliary police unit in 1941, the government said.

 A West German company is seeking to resell the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> airplane that pilot <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> landed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square a year ago, a <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> sports flying club official said today. <PERSON> Karlfriedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Giesie </PERSON>, deputy manager of the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> air club, said <ORGANIZATION> Azuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> had placed advertisements for the plane in various newspapers. The company had bought the plane from the club for $ 88,000. The Soviets allowed the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> air club to fly the plane back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last October, and the club sold it to <ORGANIZATION> Azuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now they -LRB- the company -RRB- are seeking a huge profit on it and have advertised it for sale in various places,'' <PERSON> Giesie </PERSON> said in an interview. He estimated <ORGANIZATION> Azuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> was asking between $ 150,000 and $ 175,000 for the plane. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tried repeatedly to contact <ORGANIZATION> Azuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> officials by telephone today for comment, but no one answered the phone. Today was an official holiday in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. Rust, now 20, flew unimpeded over Soviet territory from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, and landed in Red Square on May 28, 1987. On Sept. 4, Rust was found guilty of illegal entry into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, violating international flight regulations and malicious rowdyism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp. Rust remains in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prison, where the Soviets have permitted his parents and brother to visit him on several occasions. One advertisement, which appeared in the May 15 editions of the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, read: `` Most Famous Airplane To Sell. Do you want the only airplane to land on <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place-Moscow </LOCATION> on 28th May 1987? <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 172 will be sold in best conditions.'' According to <PERSON> Giesie </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> is now parked in a hangar at a small airport near the city of <LOCATION> Uetersen </LOCATION>, 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>.

 A 5-year-old whose right arm was torn off by a farm conveyor belt remained in critical condition today after an unsuccessful attempt to reatttach the limb, officials said. `` Regrettably, the injury was so severe, with so much destruction of the tissue, that it was not possible to rejoin the extremity,'' Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKell </PERSON>, vice president of medical affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` It's tragic for this young boy and this family.'' <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had gone to a barn at Singletary Farms on Tuesday where his mother was working on a conveyor belt that sorts cherry tomatoes, according to <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, a co-owner of the 75-acre farm.

 A sculptor unveiled his four bronze flying pigs atop a city bicentennial monument, but to the relief of some, they're a weathered green, not pink. `` I changed my mind,'' artist <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Leicester </PERSON> said. The green and lean pigs top the entrance sculpture at Bicentennial Commons at <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, a new park near downtown and along the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The pigs measure 4 -LCB- feet from tail to wing tip. They stand on their hind legs on bright blue replicas of riverboat smokestacks. Their wings are spread, and stomachs taut and slim. `` They're pigs of the'80s _ very trim,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a visitor from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> who was among a small group of people to watch Wednesday's unveiling. Three pigs covered with black cloth were lifted into place Tuesday night by a mechanical lift. The fourth was flown in Wednesday on a <LOCATION> US </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and lowered into place. `` There were many, many times I thought they would never make it,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which commissioned the $ 600,000 sculpture. The artwork contains 17 elements depicting <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s history and its river heritage. The pigs celebrate the city's heyday in the 1880s as `` Porkopolis,'' the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>'s hog-butchering capital. <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION> originally planned to cover the bronze hogs with copper plating to achieve a lifelike rosy color. But there was n't enough time, so he opted for bronze's natural patina of green, he said `` They're more subdued, more traditional _ much more appropriate,'' said <PERSON> Leicester </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and lives in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` If you want pink pigs, go to a department store, not an artist.'' Pink pigs `` would have been too much,'' agreed <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> visitor and former Cincinnatian. Some Cincinnatians had complained the pigs would make the city look foolish. They flooded local newspapers and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> with letters and calls of protest. The council tried to settle the dispute in January by conducting a hearing to air the gripes. Council members donned plastic pig snouts for the raucous gathering, and one woman even cradled a piglet. But the mediation failed when the council's attorney said the councilors were powerless because the sculpture already had been properly approved.

 A <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> man whose yacht was reported to have been rammed by gunboats was quoted as saying the Nicaraguan coast guard saved his craft from sinking in a storm. <PERSON> Stoye </PERSON> <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON>, 53, a painter from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, was towed in his yacht by a coast guard cutter to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sandino </LOCATION>, 44 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>.

His hometown was not available. He spoke in English in an interview at <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sandino </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, and his words were translated into <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> navy Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilchez </PERSON>, the port commander.

He said he had left a Mexican port, which he did not specify, on May 25 and the yacht was five times on the point of sinking when it was caught in heavy storms.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says he's looking for office space near here to begin a new TV ministry, and he may ask for air time on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> network. `` We see <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> settling back into the ` 700 Club.' We see <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> settling back,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Wednesday in front of his father's house on the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian theme park. `` The whole gospel message is a message of restoration, and if it ca n't happen for the leadership then it ca n't happen for the laymen.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has several times in the past said that he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, should have a chance to salvage the failing ministry they built before his downfall in a sex scandal last year, but <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials have always ruled it out. The ministry is up to $ 130 million in debt, and a reorganization plan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approval in Bankruptcy Court. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to talk with attorneys and <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials on behalf of developer <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who claims <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> owes him $ 14 million. Some of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s longtime supporters gave him a warm reception, and that energized his efforts to regain control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lawyers. `` He had not talked with some of these people for 15 months, and was very encouraged,'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said Wednesday. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told reporters he might try to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets when they are liquidated, but refused to say where he would get the money On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he intended to open an office near <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and go on television to ask for money. `` We need a very large space, especially because of the amount of mailing we'll have to do,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. He said a marketing firm has told him he has 1 million willing financial supporters. `` We'll start over again getting individual air stations,'' he said. `` We may offer to purchase time on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. We started with one station and we'll start again.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> then left for his home in <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in a black <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> borrowed from the leader of the Bring Bakkers Back movement. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after charges that <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him.

 A teen-age <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> prostitute shot and killed an 18-year-old Jewish seminary student with a pistol before dawn today in a park near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament building, authorities said. Police Chief <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehudai </PERSON> said the girl's motive was unclear. The 17-year-old Israeli citizen was arrested later and confessed, he said. In a landmark decision, a court in the city of <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> convicted four Israelis of violating a law that bars contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The judges ruled that the four left-wing activists acted illeglly when they met a 15-member <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Costinesti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, in November 1986. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zichrony </PERSON>, an attorney for the four, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they were the first people convicted of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law passed in 1986 that bars `` unauthorized'' contacts with members of terrorist groups. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group. <PERSON> Zichrony </PERSON> said his clients, <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dory </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiler </PERSON>, would appeal the decision. They face a maximum three-year sentence. Judge <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Baiser </PERSON> rejected defense arguments that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was not a terrorist organization, saying: `` The acts of terrorism have not ceased although here and there we do hear some different talk.'' The <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> attack came a day after Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> warned Palestinian underground leaders to end their 6-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands. The Israeli killed today was the third since Arabs in the territories revolted on Dec. 8. Army figures say 207 Palestinians have been killed, 157 of them shot to death by soldiers. City police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> described the shooting as a terrorist attack, apparently related to the uprising in the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. However, he said other motives for the shooting were being investigated, including insanity. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> identified the victim as <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlesinger </PERSON>, 18, a student at <LOCATION> Sha'arei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chesed </LOCATION>, a religious seminary near the park where the shooting occurred. The girl, whom police declined to identify because she is a minor, went to the park with two clients at about 1:30 a.m., <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. They encountered `` two seminary students who were there by chance. She spoke to them and then suddenly took out a pistol and fired,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Shlesinger </PERSON> was hit by five bullets and killed. The other student was unhurt, but reportedly being treated for shock. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said a security officer who passed by the park and heard the shots grabbed the girl as she fled the scene. She later admitted to the shooting after questioning, he said. <PERSON> Yehudai </PERSON> said the girl lived in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and spoke fluent Hebrew. A fellow student said <PERSON> Shlesinger </PERSON> went to the park with a friend `` to get fresh air after a long day of studying.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, was chosen Wednesday to be his party's candidate to lead the country if <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> wins the November general election. `` Do we still have to prove that we have the power to cut off every hand that is raised against us? If we have n't proven it already, we will have to increase the pressure,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told party delegates. Also Wednesday, a military source said the army had started to negotiate with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> village leaders in the occupied lands, promising them rewards if they ensure calm. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> meanwhile met with four Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, his third such meeting in a week, a defense official said. The participants discussed political issues, such as a final settlement for the occupied territories, during the two-hour meeting, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Authorities refused to name the Palestinians who participated in the meeting, saying their lives might be in danger if the information was disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials on Wednesday met with leaders of several villages near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. The report said leaders of the village of <LOCATION> Yamun </LOCATION> reached a cooperation agreement with the army. The report did not elaborate.

 Greeting, comrades! Let's go to the videotape _ of the farm equipment? No, it's not the stuff that great <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> ratings are made of, but it's good enough to pull in 150 million viewers a night in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Vremya,'' the Soviet news show, also picked up a few million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> viewers this week thanks to The Discovery Channel, which ran it each night of the summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The Discovery Channel, available on cable in about 32 million households, supplied a running translation with the newscast. The show, `` As They See It: Soviet Nightly News,'' was introduced by <PERSON> Hodding </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. If American viewers were surprised by what they saw, quite possibly so were Soviets. Though stodgy farm equipment stories and use of still photographs instead of videotape illustrated a continuing lack of sophistication in Soviet television, there were segments of Monday night's edition of `` Vremya'' that suggested major changes in Soviet TV coverage since the advent of glasnost, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. For instance, there was a report on a meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and dissidents. The fact that it was reported at all was surprising, though it was described rather snidely by a commentator as not `` objective.'' He added, however, that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> might learn something about human rights from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other segments included coverage of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with cute <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> schoolchildren who sang `` It's a Small World After All.'' The Soviet segment was hardly distinguishable from American coverage of similar events, suggesting fluff is the same the world over. `` Vremya'' opened with the biggest and seemingly dullest story of the day, the status of arms negotiations, described by a stylishly dressed anchorwoman in a droning official commentary. Much of the reporting on the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings was traditional: the co-anchors _ the man and woman do not acknowledge each other's existence _ read official communiques that included long lists of those present at official events. It hardly was exciting television, but important to Soviets who closely follow the rising and falling fortunes of various officials as indicated by their public appearances or disappearances. There was virtually no contribution from reporters on the scene, though there was videotape from a banquet the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> threw for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> explained that much of the banquet coverage was cut because `` Vremya'' ran 35 minutes longer than its usual 40 minutes to include the speeches by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in their entirety. American viewers would long since have switched to `` Wheel of Fortune.'' But in the past, Soviet TV cameras were forbidden to show such scenes as the flower-decked tables at the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> banquet. And a waiter could be seen carrying a bottle of wine, despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of anti-alcoholism Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power, the wives of Soviet leaders were rarely shown on television. But <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was seen prominently sitting just in front of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the banquet, reading from the text of his speech as he delivered his remarks. A later segment treated her as an important Soviet official in her own right as she dedicated a statue symbolizing peace. While the Soviet and American leaders talked, so did <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> for `` Vremya.'' It is a small world after all, because as every TV journalist, Soviet or American, knows, when you're stuck with what is basically a no-news event, what do you do? Interview each other.

<HEAD>Park District Approves Steer Dressing for Rodeo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city has decided it's all right if steers wear the pants at rodeos. Animal rights activists had asked the Livermore Area Recreation and <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to ban use of electric prods and the steer dressing event at the <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION>. `` Odd animal events are the main issue, not the rodeo,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Peninsula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. But the board Wednesday decided to allow both the prods and the steer dressing event, in which cowboys chase steers and try to dress their hind legs in a pair of blue jeans. `` Many rodeo events do n't represent what is done on the ranch'' and should be stopped, said <PERSON> Doll </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a member of the Fund for Animals. The standing-room-only crowd at the agency meeting included more than 100 flag-waving rodeo fans and only a handful of animal rights activists. The cowboys in the crowd greeted the decision with cheers. `` If I'm ever reincarnated send me back as a rodeo animal,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON>, a professional rodeo cowboy. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 18-year-old president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said of the activists' efforts: `` This is the first step and next year it will be something else. It seems eventually rodeo is just going to die.'' The two-day <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> opens June 11.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement that Indians were given reservations to `` humor'' them undermines <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of the way the Soviets treat their minorities, an Indian businessman said. `` It's just another one of his scary remarks, another in a long series of political and mental lapses,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bressette </PERSON>, a Chippewa Indian, said Wednesday. `` It belies a real lack of any understanding of American history,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlender </PERSON>, executive administrator of the Great Lakes Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in remarks to Soviet university students during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, said `` maybe we made a mistake'' in trying to maintain Indian cultures. `` Maybe we should not have humored them in that, wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, ` No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` If we were just being humored, the joke's on you.

 Two senior officials of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were charged today with hiring a group of men to kidnap an employee who was trying to organize a labor union. Earlier today, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks at the headquarters of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to protest the kidnapping at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. No injuries were reported. Labor unrest continued at three other <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries in southern <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group is one of the largest conglomerates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, management locked out 20,000 striking workers at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> and said there was little chance of settling a strike for higher wages. The strike began Monday. At <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes trains, management and workers held two rounds of talks today but failed to end a one-week strike at the company's plants in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>. The talks were held one day after strikers freed one of the 11 executives they took hostage on Friday. `` Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the students shouted as tey hurled rocks at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group's main building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, breaking four windows. The students ran away before police arrived. Hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested two <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> officials, executive board member <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jae-dong </PERSON>, 47, and manager for general affairs <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-ku </PERSON>, 42, and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizer <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-ui </PERSON>, 34. The government prosecutors said they would expand the investigation to find out whether other <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials were involved in the kidnapping. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as he left a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> restaurant where he had met with some officials of the huge construction company, which is based in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, who worked at the company's <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> headquarters, returned home several days later and said he was released after he agreed to write a letter of resignation addressed to the company. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> Engineering denied involvement at the time. Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of the alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities. Their leader told police <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> executives offered him $ 27,000 to kidnap <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> and persuade him to drop his labor organizing effort.

 A reputed leader of a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> gang accused of drug trafficking, extortion and murder has been arrested after a year on the run. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, a convicted drug dealer placed on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Most Wanted List this week, was captured along with his wife, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>, on Wednesday at his home of three weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Farmer, 35, was wanted for racketeering activities. He is accused of leading <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Little Mafia, described by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as a gang of drug dealers, loan sharks and burglars tied to two murders in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They were a vicious group,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They were well organized. They would set goals they wanted. And they would use violence, kill somebody or use great bodily harm if that's what they needed to accomplish their goal.'' In April 1987, while in his attorney's custody to prepare for trial, Farmer and his wife tied up and gagged the lawyer and escaped, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Nine <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and eight members of the police SWAT team surrounded the house rented by Farmer after authorities received a telephone tip from a co-worker, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> was arrested when she drove away from the house, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Fifteen minutes later, Farmer `` bolted from the door into the arms of waiting <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents,'' he said. Farmer had worked at a supermarket warehouse in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> under the name <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neiwiadomski </PERSON>, authorities said. The couple were jailed for an appearance before a federal magistrate Friday.

The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the move had been proposed by President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who is also chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> which determines <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strategy in the war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has held the title of commander-in-chief, but overall strategy has been determined by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s respresentative on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and other leaders. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decision followed two serious Iranian defeats in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war and major gains by radicals and militants in two-stage parliamentary elections in April and May that strengthened <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decree said that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was taking over command of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s forces at a time `` when imperialist <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in collaboration with East and West and the reactionary states of the region, are trying to confront Islam and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and prevent the victory of the Islamic revolution.'' The radio said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> noted: `` I hereby want all the dear people of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and military forces to be patient and resistant and stand against the conspiracies of global arrogance.'' `` Global arrogance'' is the phrase <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> uses to describe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s move clearly strengthens <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s position in the government and indicates that <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> apparently has been edged out. A major shake-up in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military command had been expected since the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army pushed the Iranians out of their important bridgehead east of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in a lightning assault on May 25. The Iraqis recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, in a two-day assault April 16-18, driving the Iranians back across the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> waterway two years after they seized the dusty finger of land. Those defeats cost the Iranians their main footholds on Iraqi soil and were seen as major military setbacks at a time of political uncertainty in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and apparent economic problems. After the loss of Faw, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> replaced the armed forces chief of staff, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohrabi </PERSON>, with a little-known officer, Col. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON>, and promoted him to brigadier general. Western military analysts said at the time that `` more heads are expected to roll.'' <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON>, 42, a regular army officer, has a background in guerrilla warfare and has commanded armored units. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s appointment came as military analysts expected the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy to reassess its strategy of attrition against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> following their twin defeats. The Iraqis had expected the fighting in both cases to take several days. But to their surprise, the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> assault took less than 36 hours and the Iranians were rolled back from their positions in 10 hours. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media has reported tens of thousands of `` basij,'' or volunteers, have been dispatched to the front in recent days. But there was no clear evidence of any major single buildup along the 730-mile war front.

 Police said today that Sikh extremists killed at least 36 people in the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> before it was besieged by police, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. Many of the victims reportedly were tortured. Alos today, two more decomposed bodies were removed from the temple complex, raising to 16 the number of corpses found around the shrine since the radicals surrendered May 18, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Police continue to maintain a cordon around the shrine at <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to prevent militants from returning. UNI quoted unidentified senior police sources as saying police were told of the killings by some of the 200 Sikh radicals and sympathizers who surrendered during the siege. Many of the victims were tortured before they were killed, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. The extremists said the victims were beaten with iron rods and whips and that salt was rubbed into their wounds. Electric shocks also were used, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. In some cases, the Sikh extremists extorted money from the victims' families on the false promise that they would be freed. The funds went to the <ORGANIZATION> Panthic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, one of a dozen Sikh extremist groups operating in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, to buy arms and ammunition, the news agency said. There had been reports for months that people going into the shrine for worship were being kidnapped and held by militants in the complex, but the full extent of the problem did not come to light until after the police action. Most of the bodies have been found in a dump next to the Akal Takht, or the seat of temporal power of the Sikh faith. Militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> is the capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Sikhs, who make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus They form a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The radicals have been blamed for killing more than 1,240 people in hit-and-run attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state this year. In 1987, 1,030 people died. The siege of the temple was launched May 9 after militants inside the complex fired on a police party outside its walls. At least 46 people were killed in fighting during the 10-day siege, most of them radicals.

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the joint communique issued at the close of the summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: The President and the General Secretary view the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit as an important step in the process of putting U.S.-Soviet relations on a more productive and sustainable basis. Their comprehensive and detailed discussions covered the full agenda of issues to which the two leaders agreed during their initial meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985 _ an agenda encompassing arms control, human rights and humanitarian matters, settlement of regional conflicts, and bilateral relations. Serious differences remain on important issues; the frank dialogue which has developed between the two countries remains critical to surmounting these differences. The talks took place in a constructive atmosphere which provided ample opportunity for candid exchange. As a result, the sides achieved a better understanding of each other's positions. The two leaders welcomed the progress achieved in various areas of U.S.-Soviet relations since their last meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, notwithstanding the difficulty and complexity of the issues. They noted with satisfaction numerous concrete agreements which have been achieved, and expressed their determination to redouble efforts in the months ahead in areas where work remains to be done. They praised the creative and intensive efforts made by representatives of both sides in recent months to resolve outstanding differences. Assessing the state of U.S.-Soviet relations, the President and the General Secretary underscored the historic importance of their meetings in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in laying the foundation for a realistic approach to the problems of strengthening stability and reducing the risk of conflict. They reaffirmed their solemn conviction that a nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought, their determination to prevent any war between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whether nuclear or conventional, and their disavowal of any intention to achieve military superiority. The two leaders are convinced that the expanding political dialogue they have established represents an increasingly effective means of resolving the issues of mutual interest and concern. They do not minimize the real differences of history, tradition and ideology which will continue to characterize the U.S.-Soviet relationship. But they believe that the dialogue will endure, because it is based on realism and focused on the achievement of concrete results. It can serve as a constructive basis for addressing not only the problems of the present, but of tomorrow and the next century. It is a process which the President and the General Secretary believe serves the best interests of the peoples of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and can contribute to a more stable, more peaceful and safer world.

<HEAD>Human Rights and Humanitarian Concerns</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The President and the General Secretary engaged in a detailed discussion of human rights and humanitarian concerns. The leaders reviewed the increasingly broad and detailed U.S.-Soviet dialogue in this area and agreed that it should be conducted at all levels in order to achieve sustained, concrete progress. They noted that this dialogue should seek to maximize assurance of the rights, freedoms and human dignity of individuals; promotion of people-to-people communications and contacts; active sharing of spiritual, cultural, historical and other values; and greater mutual understanding and respect between the two countries. Toward this end, they discussed the possible establishment of a forum which, meeting regularly, would bring together participants from across the range of their two societies. They noted steps already taken to establish the exchange of information and contacts between legislative bodies, as well as discussions between legal experts, physicians and representatives of other professions directly involved in matters pertaining to human rights, and between representatives of non-governmental organizations.

<HEAD>Regional Issues</HEAD>

 The President and the General Secretary thoroughly discussed a wide range of regional questions, including the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the Iran-Iraq war, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and other issues. They expressed satisfaction with the April 1988 conclusion in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> of accords on an <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> settlement. Although the discussions revealed serious differences both in the assessment of the causes of regional tensions and in the means to overcome them, the leaders agreed that these differences need not be an obstacle to constructive interaction between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the U.S.S.R. They reaffirmed their intention to continue U.S.-Soviet discussions at all levels aimed at helping parties to regional conflicts find peaceful solutions which advance their independence, freedom and security. They emphasized the importance of enhancing the capacity of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and other international institutions to contribute to the resolution of regional conflicts.

 Officials today said they did not know the value of a 16th century Portuguese war ship whose treasure was found in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>. They denied saying the vessel, sunk in 1512, carried $ 3 billion in gold and precious stones. News reports had quoted the Chief Minister of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thamby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chik </PERSON>, as saying the treasure aboard the ship was worth about $ 3 billion. Contacted by telephone, an official in the Chief Minister's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the chief minister had not given any value for the treasure The Star daily quoted the Chief Minister as saying, `` I never stated the estimated value of the loot. How can we estimate things we have never seen?'' Earlier this week <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said a foreign marine group had found the treasure in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> and the state government was contacting the federal government to negotiate for bringing up the treasure of the <PERSON> Flor </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mar </PERSON>. The ship was the flagship of <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Albuquerque </PERSON>, who led an 800-strong armada that conquered <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> in 1511. He was taking the booty back to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> when it sank. He managed to escape to another ship accompanying the <PERSON> Flor </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mar </PERSON>, but most of the treasure sank.

 Militant Sinhalese nationalists hurled bombs and grenades at voters and polling places during provincial elections today, killing a police officer, authorities said. Polls closed with less than half the eligible voters in two provinces casting ballots, election officials estimated. An opposition party immediately claimed fraud. The policeman was killed and six others wounded in two attacks on polling places in the village of <LOCATION> Mattugama </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. At <LOCATION> Dullewa </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, gunmen jumped two policeman who had been watching a polling place. The assailants tied the officers to a tree and stole their automatic rifles but did not harm them, a police spokesman said. Late Wednesday, an airman was killed by suspected Sinhalese radicals who ambushed his car, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The deputy elections commissioner, <PERSON> Lakshman </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that less than 50 percent of the 3.6 million eligible voters in the Central and Western provinces cast ballots. Results were not expected until Friday. The voting for provincial councils, in its second round today, was called for under last July's peace accord to end the 5-year-old revolt by militant Tamil separatists. The nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> insists the accord makes too many concessions to the minority Tamils and opposes the councils, which are designed to give more autonomy to the provinces. Tamils dominate the Northern and Eastern provinces, where polling has been postponed because of fear of violence by Tamil separatists. Tamils, most of whom are Hindu, comprise 18 percent of this island nation's 16 million people. They claim discrimination by the mostly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who make up 75 percent of the population. The rest are descendants of Christian colonialists or Moslem traders. On Wednesday, nationalist Sinhalese gangs burned down more than 15 government buildings, torched six buses and three trains and killed a policeman in a bid to disrupt today's balloting. They also put up posters threatening to kill anyone who voted and any shopkeepers who opened their stores for the next 36 hours. The government responded by tightening security and ordering security personnel to `` shoot on sight'' anyone `` engaged in the destruction of public property.'' The voters cast ballots today for 158 lawmakers from 585 candidates fielded by the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The third announced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons test in less than three weeks rocked the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert today and registered distinctly on seismic equipment atop hotels and casinos here, 110 miles from ground zero. The device buried 2,000 feet below the desert floor was detonated at 6 a.m. in the fifth such test of the year at the 1,350-square-mile <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. The test was conducted within hours of the close of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, where nuclear testing was among the topics discussed. The Soviets and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> formally agreed to monitor each other's tests beginning this summer. The blast had an explosive force of up to 150 kilotons, or the equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The atomic bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> had a yield of 13 kilotons. All tests are listed as less than 20 kilotons or 20 to 150 kilotons. Managers of high-rise buildings in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> are warned when tests are expected to reach near the upper limit. Such a warning was issued Tuesday. The blast measured 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the equivalent of a moderate to strong earthquake, at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Everything appears normal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said as she monitored the blast from a point 31 miles from ground zero. `` Nothing is coming out of the ground.'' The success of the underground tests is measured, in part, by the ability to prevent radiation from leaking into the atmosphere. DOE seismic equipment atop the Golden Nugget and Mint hotels in downtown <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and the El Rancho Hotel on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> recorded the blast distinctly, said Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON>. Security guards at several Las Vegas hotels said they did not feel any motion from the blast, as they often do with large detonations. At the time, Soviet scientists setting up monitoring equipment at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site were at Mercury, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, 52 miles from ground zero.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser today watched an Iranian navy frigate stop, board and then escort away a <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> cargo ship apparently suspected of carrying war-related cargo for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials who reported the incident in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> said the Iranian ship, tentatively identified as the 1,540-ton frigate <LOCATION> Alborz </LOCATION>, was acting within maritime law that allows for `` visit and search'' in international waters. There was no confrontation or exchange of radio messages between the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship, the 9,400-ton <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, and either of the other two vessels, according to Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Officials on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> watched the incident from two miles away. The Cypriot ship, identified by gulf-based shipping executives as the 10,000-ton cargo vessel <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, `` did not request assistance and did not appear to be in any distress,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. However, he said it was the closest that any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Iranian warships have come to each other in the gulf since April 18, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships and aircraft sank or disabled six Iranian craft in a series of clashes in the southern gulf and the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. `` The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had the others in view as the Iranian frigate stopped the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> ship, launched a small boat that put a search party on board and then escorted her off in a northeasterly direction,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION> was carrying Italian marble powder and chips to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Jubail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s said the Cypriot vessel `` apparently'' was boarded by eight Iranians, and was being escorted to <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a major Iranian port and naval base in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> considers both <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to be allies of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and frequently attacks ships bound to or from ports in those countries. It also regularly stops and searches vessels that it suspects of carrying war-related materiel and sometimes takes the ships into detention. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, a sophisticated electronics warfare ship and the most powerful ever deployed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the gulf, was on its first week of patrol duty in the area, some 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> bade farewell at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> today, concluding a summit long on good will but short of achievement. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said they had moved superpower relations `` from a dangerous track to a safer one'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed hope for `` an era of peace.'' Ending the first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by an American president in 14 years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had been moved by the reception he got in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took the occasion to prod <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to move faster on the issues facing the two superpowers. The talks completed the most frequent superpower summits in history, four in just 30 months, underscoring the dramatic turnaround in U.S.-Soviet relations since the first meeting in 1985. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> each had three summits with their Soviet counterparts. Air Force One took off from <LOCATION> Vnukovo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in a light drizzle at approximately 11:15 a.m. local time. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> just after 11:30 a.m. local time The president had meetings scheduled there with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faces, by month's end, the convening of the first <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> since 1941. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who flew separately to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, to brief <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, called the talks `` a good, realistic, businesslike summit meeting.'' And Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. An unnamed Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official quoted <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had asked the Soviets to urge <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to exercise restraint during the upcoming summer Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The meetings here produced renewed vows by leaders to improve <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations and put into force the first-ever treaty to eliminate nuclear weapons. But tensions over regional conflicts lingered, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not advance prospects for a long-range missile treaty in any substantive fashion. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> said goodbye to the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> in the same Kremlin hall where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first couple was greeted on Sunday. Walking along the same red carpet in the Hall of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> after brief remarks, the four chatted amiably and then parted company a moment later. <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a bouquet of roses in what perhaps will the last encounter for two first ladies whose relationship never was warm. `` This is an emotional moment for Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and me,'' the president said, telling the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> he had seen and learned much about `` this <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was impressed with the Soviet people he encountered. `` At first they were curious faces, but as time went on, the smiles began and then the waves,'' he said, `` And I do n't have to tell, you, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I smiled back and waved just as hard.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for `` cooperation, openness and a businesslike approach to the talks that we have had here.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary also said there were missed opportunities at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. `` Our dialogue has not been easy,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` but we mustered enough realism and political will to overcome obstacles and divert the train of U.S.-Soviet relations from a dangerous track to a safer one. It is, however, so far, been moving much more slowly than is required ....''. ...'' As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had challenged the president at their windup summit meeting over the wording of the final communique. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the two leaders were `` going at it pretty heavy until the end.'' Among other things, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side disagreed with some language in the communique that was used in the context of a broader embrace by both countries of the concept of `` peaceful coexistence.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further on arms control, but said, `` We came out just about where it was predicted we could come out. It would have been nice if we could have gone any further, but nobody expected us to go any further.'' In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` We had lots of things that were worked out, and we've had some very realistic, strong discussion, where we did n't agree, and that's in the nature of this case. ... I think it's a sign of maturity and perhaps greater stability, that we can wrangle on these things and agree on other things.'' Their work done, on their final night in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> went to the Bolshoi Ballet with the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> and dined privately with their hosts at a dacha in the countryside outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Then, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> took an impromptu stroll through Red Square, which was brightly illuminated by mobile floodlights brought in by networks to provide a backdrop for their evening newscasts. `` I did n't want her to miss it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, holding hands with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> actually concluded their formal talks Wednesday _ reporting scant progress on arms control and none on human rights disputes. After five days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have tea with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> and dine with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at No. 10 Downing Street. On Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will deliver a post-summit speech summing up East-West relations, then return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On his arrival at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was greeted by Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and a light drizzle from overcast skies. After shaking hands and waving to a small crowd under the watchful eyes of police guards armed with submachine guns, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> boarded a helicopter and flew to the <ORGANIZATION> Winfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> residence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> II in Regent's Park Despite the lack of major agreements, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called their meetings a `` blow to the foundations of the Cold War.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went to extraordinary lengths to praise the Soviet leader, seemingly absolving the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership for erecting barriers to emigration. He blamed the emigration walls on the Soviet bureaucracy, saying any government has that kind of problem. Arriving today at <ORGANIZATION> Winfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the 35-room mansion where he will stay, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked what he meant in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> when he seemed to blame the bureaucracy for restricting emigration. `` I do n't think I made it that definite, but that is some of the problems there, just as there are in our country,'' he replied. `` I was answering a question, a specific question, that is not to say that it was not all just a bureaucracy.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, himself, might be responsible for the repressive laws, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded, `` I was trying to put out that sometimes cases of that kind do not get that far up the ladder.'' While the two leaders deepened their relationship, the long-rumored feud between their wives flared into the open. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> dropped all pretense of the hand-holding relationship that had been portrayed earlier in the week and competed for the spotlight in a duel that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said ended in `` a Mexican standoff.''

 A lawyer for a former professor suing to become the fifth woman to receive tenure in <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s history pressed on with the trial today rather than accept a delay to gather more evidence <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> on Wednesday ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> withheld key documents in the sex-discrimination case, and he recommended suspending the non-jury trial so the attorney for <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bund </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could question professors who abruptly withdrew support for her tenure bid in 1981. `` My fundamental view is that cases should be decided on the merits and evidence worth submitting when possible,'' <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said today. But the attorney, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, said today, `` We simply do n't have the emotional resources, let alone the financial resources, to embark on what we see as being an extremely complicated and lengthy procedure. Closing arguments then began in the trial, now in its eighth day. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contends that she was denied tenure because of her sex and that less-qualified men than her received tenure. During testimony, a professor said the school's faculty voted 47-7 to support her bid for tenure but two days later backed her by only 29-27. Tenure decisions at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> are submitted to the faculty to gauge support for the professor; the actual decision rests with the university president. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had filed a motion seeking to sanction <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> for failing to provide evidence about the vote under a court order requiring that the university turn over all documents relating to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He asked the judge to bar <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> from using the second vote to prove its contention that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was denied tenure solely because her academic performance was below standard. But the judge denied the request today. Suspending the trial would have required testimony from professors who switched their votes and would have pushed the case well into the fall, attorneys for both sides said. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> maintained that testimony by a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor shows that business school Dean <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> lobbied the faculty to switch votes to oppose <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who began teaching at the school in 1973. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> resigned in 1984 after she was denied tenure a second time, in 1983. At issue is the question of academic privilege, the right of a university to keep confidential the names of professors involved in judging candidates for tenure. In recommending suspending the trial, <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said: `` It's a pattern of limitations placed on proof _ limitations by destruction, limitations by late disclosure ... and limitations on proof by this privilege.'' In her suit, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also alleges the school destroyed documents requested by her to support her claim that less-qualified men received tenure from 1974 to 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> said the destruction was inadvertent. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> indicated the school might risk being held in contempt of court and refuse to provide the names of the professors to preserve their academic privilege. The school claims that failing to provide the 1981 votes was an oversight and that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> never specifically requested the results. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 44, now a private marketing consultant, first applied for tenure in 1981. After failing to gain tenure, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was given a three-year extension on her appointment. She submitted new academic work for review, but in 1983 was rebuffed again. She sued in 1984. Three of the business school's 90 tenured professors are women. Four women have received tenure in the business school's 80-year history, the first in 1961.

 Soviet and Canadian skiers without vehicles or sled dogs finished a three-month polar trek from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in sunshine and 30-degree temperatures. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today praised the skiers. A gala welcome awaits the team in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> tonight. `` Your journey has added to trust, mutual understanding and good neighborliness in this world,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. He praised the `` courage, true comradeship and mutual assistance'' of the nine Soviets and four Canadians in completing their 91-day, 1,075-mile journey across the North Pole on Wednesday. An expedition spokeswoman, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, said the group sent a short-wave message after leaving the shifting ice pack and reaching <LOCATION> Ward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hunt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Ellesmere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the northernmost part of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. All 13 adventurers who set out March 3 from <ORGANIZATION> Severnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zemlya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archipelago </ORGANIZATION>, the northernmost point in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, finished the journey under the leadership of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> mathematician <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON> and Canadian mechanical engineer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. Aided by good weather, they reached the North Pole on April 26 and completed the trek a few days earlier than expected, Ms. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said. Their worst problems were a frostbitten nose for Soviet member <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Khmelevskiy </PERSON> and a toenail lost to the frost by Canadian Dr. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON>, who provided the emotional highlight of the trip by proposing to his fiancee by radio message from the Arctic. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, a dental hygienist in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, accepted and will be waiting for him in the <LOCATION> Ellesmere </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>. In a message to Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, the team said: `` We thank you for your interest in our venture and hope it has sparked an interest and openness in many Soviets and Canadians in the unique northern relationship between our two countries.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, through an emissary in <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, said the group completed the trip in `` spectacular fashion.'' Fresh supplies were dropped to the explorers five times during the trip, and each member carried a backpack with essentials such as a high-protein, high-fat diet of bacon and dried fish to maintain energy and body heat. `` I'm sure they're celebrating now as they do final blood tests and take final snow samples,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Party Official Calls For Publication of Khrushchev Speech on
Stalin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teacher of Marxism-Leninism today renewed calls for the publication of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s 1956 `` secret speech'' denouncing <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and said it is a secret only from Soviet Communists like himself. `` If the party is keeping secrets from Communists in the pages of its history that are not state secrets, then it is clear that it does n't serve the unity of the party,'' said <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON>, dean of the Philosophy and <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Sverdlovsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and a member of the party. <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON>'s comments appeared in an article published in today's editions of the Sovietskaya Kultura newspaper It appeared to be the latest example in the leadership's campaign to open up the pages of Soviet history. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s address to the 20th Party Congress, held three years after the death of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1953, detailed the dictator's actions in the 29 years he served as Soviet leader. Western historians estimate that 20 million Soviets were killed in political purges carried out under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and in the drive to collectivize agriculture. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes are no longer a taboo subject, and the name of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who was ousted as leader in 1964, is appearing more frequently in the press The call by <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON> to publish <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s denuncation of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is not the first. In October, prominent Soviet scientist <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldansky </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s report, known in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as his `` secret speech'' because it was delivered behind closed doors, should be published. <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON> said the text of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s speech was leaked almost immediately in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` All the world a long time ago read the ` secret' report by N.S. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> ... but an overwhelming majority of Soviet Communists do n't know this document, which so radically changed the evaluation of the development of the party and the state,'' the educator wrote.

<HEAD>Tobacco Co. Claims Woman's Cancer Not A Type Linked to Cigarettes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> had a form of lung cancer not usually associated with smoking, a tobacco company lawyer told a jury hearing final arguments today in a lawsuit against three cigarette makers. Lawyers representing Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s widower `` must convince you that cigarette-smoking caused <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lung cancer,'' not that smoking causes cancer in general, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON> argued in the closely watched product liability case. In his summation, he noted the testimony of medical experts for the defense who said Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s cancer bore all the signs of atypical carcinoid, which they contend is not statistically associated with smoking. Experts for the plaintiff testified Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> had small cell carcinoma, which is tied to cigarettes, and argued that atypical carcinoid also results from smoking. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> accuses <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of misleading the public about the dangers of smoking and contributing to his 58-year-old wife's death in 1984 after 40 years of smoking. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> had a right to smoke knowing the risks, and a maker of her cigarettes has a First Amendment right to say smoking is not a proven cancer-cause. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> enjoyed smoking, and that was why she continued to smoke, and she did n't want anyone to tell her not to do it,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told jurors in the courtroom packed with about 150 spectators. In the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> contends they misled the public about the dangers of cigarettes. If the jury awards the 64-year-old retired construction worker damages, which are not specified, it would be the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by smokers and their families. Attorneys for the other companies were scheduled to present summations today. The case, filed in 1983, is one of fewer than a dozen smoker liability lawsuits to reach a jury, and other lawyers bringing similar actions say a Cipollone victory could spur a new wave of litigation. Smoking opponents argue that a defeat for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> might permanently stifle such lawsuits because of the effort, time and expense put into the case by his side. The case was expected to go to the jury Monday. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> called Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> an intelligent, strong-willed person who `` was used to making decisions for herself and family. ... She did what she wanted to do.'' The case rests on `` the simple proposition that if you believe the testimony of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> and her family, that she smoked cigarettes because she wanted to and because she liked to, even though she knew the risks,'' then the jury `` should return a verdict for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> returned often to her own testimony, given in 1984 and read to the jury, and noted her response during an interview with an addiction expert who reminded her of the first Surgeon General's report on smoking in 1964: `` ` I did n't want to hear it I liked to smoke. I liked the way I looked. It gave me something to do.''' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> says the companies, through inadequate research and a failure to publicize what they knew about the dangers of smoking, should be held liable for damages in his wife's death. However, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> asserted that the companies had a First Amendment right to express their belief that smoking has not been proven to cause cancer. `` There was a raging controversy about smoking and health in the press, and in a free country, people are entitled to express an opinion, and that was what was going on,'' he said. Through a series of pretrial rulings and a major decision last month by the trial judge, <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>, most of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s claims were cut from the lawsuit The jury must still determine whether each company intentionally misrepresented claims about the health consequences of smoking and whether each conspired to do so. As for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, the jury will consider claims that the company failed to warn the public about the risks of its products, and whether <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> violated its warranty duties. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s cigarettes before 1966, the year warnings were put on cigarette packs. The courts have ruled that the warnings pre-empt failure-to-warn claims after that year. Both sides presented dozens of witnesses, including company executives, company researchers, physicians, medical experts, advertising and marketing experts and <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> family members.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> canceled today's debate with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and was returning home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to be with his wife who was to undergo surgery, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> late Wednesday for campaign appearances and then the debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, hoped to resume his schedule by Saturday, said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be operated on Friday for two herniated cervical disks in her neck. He said there were no other problems beyond the disks. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underwent tests recently while in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and her doctors in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> decided an operation was required after reviewing the results. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 53, was admitted to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> General Hospital Wednesday night. She told told reporters at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as she arrived in town that she had begun to experience numbness in her hands and fingers about a month ago and called a family doctor. `` He and I felt at that time it was just stress,'' she said, adding that her symptoms worsened in recent weeks. Her husband had resumed his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign earlier today, five days before the state's big primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been campaigning this week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which also holds its primary on Tuesday, along with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is far ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the nationwide delegate tally, and is heavily favored to win the primary here. In recent days, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been engaged in a delicate minuet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> over his rival's role in the fall campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who says he wo n't pick a running mate until after the final primaries June 7, lauded <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strong campaign. `` He's somebody who has done a remarkable job, has great gifts and great strengths. I respect and admire him a lot,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was questioned about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role one day after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that he felt he had `` earned consideration'' for the second spot on the ballot. Asked if that was so, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded, `` Because he has done so well, of course he does.'' He added that all of the Democratic presidential candidates had earned the standing within the party to be considered for the ticket. But when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserved any special consideration by virtue of having compiled the second-highest number of delegates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> answered with a blunt `` No.'' In a speech on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stressed his commitment to expanding opportunities for higher education, calling it a prerequisite for full participation in the nation's economic future. `` We need a president who will end the annual assault on Pell Grants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We need to put our smartest investment bankers and college administrators to work helping states to create college opportunity funds.'' Speaking at the state's newest community college in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section, the traditional core of the city's black community, the governor called for a new nationwide college loan program `` We can develop an approach based on the same principles as Social Security that will keep faith with the next generation,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his program would provide tuition loans to needy students. After graduation, students would repay the loans through payroll withholding, thus ensuring that the governnment would not be saddled with unpaid loans.

<TEXT>
 If nothing else, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit was a public relations triumph for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Although it produced little progress on arms control, the Reagan-Gorbachev summit showed the Soviets at their best under the intense scrutiny of 5,000 Soviet and foreign journalists who crowded central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet officials were accessible and doggedly spontaneous. Ever-hovering <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents were usually young and well-dressed. Streets were swept clean and restaurants offered two <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rarities: attentive service and fresh vegetables. Even the weather cooperated. It did n't start raining until President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was ready to leave <LOCATION> Vnukovo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Veteran <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> observers said the Soviets, in style if not in substance, are increasingly emulating the West. One little-known reason why the new Soviet image appeals to Americans is that Soviet officials have frequently but quietly sought PR advice from Americans. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> image-makers responded with a variety of suggestions. They said security agents should wear lighter, less drab colors, and Soviet officials should favor open-collared shirts instead of ties and try to be more accessible. They also suggested that Soviet analysts establish eye contact because, as one public relations specialist explained, `` it connotes trust.'' `` The Soviets certainly do n't want to give Americans the credit, but there is no denying that some things went off very well because of both our input and their observance of us at the previous three summits,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavulich </PERSON>, chairman of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, marketing firm that has worked with the Soviets since 1986. `` Officials from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on down were n't running away from the television cameras, they were stepping up to them,'' <PERSON> Kavulich </PERSON> said. `` The Soviets usually carried off media events with a flair. And they reinforced the idea that they have a sense of humor.'' In a move clearly intended to appeal to Westerners, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> sold summit T-shirts, buttons, records and tapes for foreign currency. It was the first time that <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> had lent its name to a commercial enterprise. Some observers suggested the Soviets might even have worked some magic with the weather, using chemicals to disperse rain clouds as they did in 1986 for the Goodwill Games and the 1985 opening of the World Youth Festival. There were some glitches. Hours after President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived Sunday for the five-day summit, they took an unscheduled stroll along <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s pedestrian mall on Arbat Street. Soviet agents obviously were unprepared for presidential spontaneity. Forcing themselves between the Reagans and the Soviet crowd, the agents jostled the president and the startled first lady as well as journalists and passers-by. `` The Soviets knew the Reagans would have some spontaneous event to match <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s walk along <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>'' during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit in December, <PERSON> Kavulich </PERSON> said. `` Agents on the street were told to let the president approach a crowd of Muscovites if he wants. But apparently, for the agents, acting as a wedge between Soviets and foreigners was almost a reflexive action,'' he said. Nevertheless, as one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said privately, `` The Soviets are probably patting themselves on the back. They went every night into homes throughout <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and as each night passed, they became more familiar and more welcome guests.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cut short a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign trip and canceled today's debate with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> where his wife faced surgery to relieve neck pain. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was meeting today with juvenile gangs in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relaxed in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been making few public appearances in recent days while President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been at the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did hint in an interview published today that embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> could be hurting his candidacy. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had flown to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Wednesday night for campaigning in the days leading up to next Tuesday's primary, the last and biggest delegate prize of the long primary season. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was flying right back to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> after a single morning campaign appearance today, said spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be operated on Friday for two herniated cervical disks in her neck. She had felt pain and numbness for about a month, he said, and doctors believed it was `` a degenerative condition'' rather than the result of a single injury. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 53, was admitted to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> General Hospital Wednesday night. She told told reporters her symptoms had worsened in recent weeks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending a final full day today at his oceanside retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, and the only order of business was having his boat checked for safety by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The vice president has been holding strategy sessions with advisers all week, and one of the key topics has been possible issues on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will set himself apart from his popular boss. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has given his full support to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is under investigation by an independent counsel. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, hinted that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s woes continue, the matter could be a campaign liability for him. The Democrats have been using the issue for months to attack him. `` I think he's been made aware by the polls and by a lot of public comment that there is the danger that this matter, if it stays exactly the way it is, could not only adversely affect me, but affect others as well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in the interview, published today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said over the weekend that he had met recently with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and the attorney general had promised not to do anything that would harm his campaign. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Monday in a <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> interview, however, that he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s record would be an asset to any <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Times he expected to meet with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> again soon. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has an all-but insurmountable delegate lead, has been beset by questions all week about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in the fall campaign. Both men have said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will play a major but as yet undetermined part in the expected race against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Wednesday, asserted for a second day in a row that he has earned consideration as a potential running mate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agreed with that, but balked when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in view of his demonstrated vote-getting ability, had any special claim on the No. 2 spot. `` No,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said flatly. But he also said of his rival: `` I respect and admire him a lot.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who drew overwhelming black support in the primary contests, has been stressing that the party needs him in order to win the general election. Party officials appear mindful of that. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> announced Wednesday that a 15-member platform-drafting panel would be headed up by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was predicting he could draw `` genuine and deep'' black support in his own right. The governor, who started off the week by meeting with black supporters, made a campaign-style visit on Wednesday to a community college in the predominantly black <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. There, he cited a groundswell of black backing for his candidacy. `` I sense it,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, was marching through the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> ghetto of Watts, which was torn by riots in the 1960s. `` Where you struggle I will struggle,'' he told cheering supporters Wednesday night. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was also meetig today with members of the rival Crips and Bloods gangs. The bloody battles of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs were dramatized in the recent movie `` Colors.'' Campaign aides said they believed it would be the first time the rival gang leaders got together. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> prepared for the primary finale, a past Democratic presidential contender jumped into the race. Former Sen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose campaign two decades ago was a rallying point for opponents of the Vietnam War, announced his candidacy on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 72, is running on the Consumer Party ticket in his fourth presidential effort.

<TEXT>
 Government prosecutors Thursday arrested two senior officials of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and charged them with paying a group of men to kidnap a labor organizer. The prosecutors said they are trying to determine whether other <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials were involved in the kidnapping. The organizer was freed after several days when he resigned as an employee of the construction company. Earlier Thursday, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks at the headquarters of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to protest the kidnapping at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. No injuries were reported. The arrests and the attack by the students came as labor unrest continued at three other <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> plants in southern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group is one of the largest conglomerates in the nation. In <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, management on Wednesday locked out 20,000 striking workers at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, and said there was little chance of settling the strike for higher wages. The walkout began Monday. At <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes trains, management and leaders of the 4,000 strikers held two rounds of talks Thursday but failed to end a one-week strike at the company's plants in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> The talks were held one day after strikers freed one of the 11 executives they took hostage on Friday. They were still holding 10 executives on Thursday. Strikers at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> want raises of up to $ 180 a month, against a company offer of $ 105. The workers earn an average of $ 750 after five years. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday offered to raise workers' pay $ 85 a month, but workers stuck to their demand of a $ 180 increase. They earn $ 600 a month. `` Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the students shouted as they hurled rocks at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group's main building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, breaking four windows. The students ran away before police arrived. Several hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested two <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> officials, executive board member <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jae-dong </PERSON>, 47, and manager for general affairs <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-ku </PERSON>, 42, and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizer <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-ui </PERSON>, 34. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as he left a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> restaurant where he had met with some officials of the construction company, which is based in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, who worked at the company's <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> headquarters, returned home several days later and said he was released after he agreed to write a letter of resignation addressed to the company. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> Engineering denied involvement at the time. Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of the alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities. Their leader told police <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> executives offered him $ 27,000 to kidnap <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> and persuade him to drop his labor organizing effort.

<HEAD>Farm Exports Soar to Highest Levels Since 1984</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm exports posted their highest levels in more than three years in March as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade balance ran in the black for a fifth straight month, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say. `` Agriculture is making an important contribution to the trade balance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Wednesday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> before the figures were released. He predicted export sales this year of around $ 33 billion and a farm trade surplus of perhaps $ 12 billion. Exports in March soared to 14.8 million tons valued at $ 3.3 billion, compared with 11.4 million tons valued at $ 2.4 billion the same month a year earlier. It was the best monthly performance since December 1984. The nation's agricultural trade surplus in March was $ 1.38 billion, also the largest since December 1984. It was the fifth straight month that the nation has posted a surplus of $ 1 billion or more. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through March totaled 77.3 million tons valued at $ 17.8 billion. It said that represented an increase of 13.6 million tons and $ 3.3 billion from the same period last year. Soviet purchases have accounted for 68 percent of the volume increase this year. Department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988 exports totaling 145.5 million tons and valued at $ 33.5 billion. That represents an increase over initial estimates. The higher forecasts are due to additional sales of animal products, as well as wheat, feeds and fodders and soybeans. Animal products are likely to set a record of $ 5.6 billion, attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides, skins, red meats and fats, the department said. The department also said exports are likely to be 16 million tons and $ 5.6 billion higher than fiscal 1987. It attributed the bulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitor nations and the Export Enhancement Program. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, pays exporters in government surplus commodities to ship American grain overseas. Estimated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural imports, meanwhile, were increased from $ 20.5 billion to $ 21 billion. It said imports for March totaled $ 1.95 billion, a gain of $ 35 million, or 2 percent, over the comparable figure for March 1987. It also was $ 24 million, or 1 percent, over the February level. The volume of imports was virtually unchanged since last year, with fruit juices, nursery products and alcoholic beverages actually posting declines, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said, however, the lower dollar raised the overall import bill.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> is calling on European Community trade negotiators to come up with their own plan to phase out farm subsidies if they dislike the American version. `` We've been unable to get the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> even to state what the outcome should be,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon Wednesday. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not insisting on its plan to phase out all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 and is `` perfectly willing to sit down and be involved in negotiations,'' but that thus far European trade officials have indicated little interest in such bargaining. `` They wo n't come up with any sort of proposal,'' he said. He expressed hope, however, that some progress could be made in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> in December at the midterm meeting of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of negotiations aimed at updating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. `` We must make this work because the alternatives are so bad,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. He said the current system of subsidies is harmful to European and American farmers as well as the economies of developing nations. But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not act unilaterally. `` Our farmers are willing to compete with farmers anywhere but they do not want to compete with the treasuries of foreign governments,'' he said. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> also shrugged off European criticism that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has increased wheat production when <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been reducing its own wheat production. `` I have been unable to detect any reductions in European production,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has idled acreage equivalent to all of the farmland in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> together while `` the reductions they are talking about are pipsqueak when they are compared to our reductions.'' The administration recently changed the acreage idling requirement for participants in the wheat program from 27 -LCB- percent to 10 percent.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s car was hit with one bullet during a brief exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a Christian militia patrol in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday, police reported. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: `` The ambassador and all his escorts are fine.'' He refused to elaborate. In another development, the Shiite Moslem Amal militia on Thursday denied it has custody of three American professors and an Indian professor kidnapped in 1987. A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said one bullet hit the hood of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s armor-plated dark blue Chevrolet in an `` accidental exchange of automatic fire. He said the gunfire occurred around noon when <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s Lebanese and American bodyguards in two escort cars fired in the air with automatic rifles `` apparently to make way for the ambassador's convoy'' in a traffic-jammed street in the Sin Fil neighborhood <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s motorcade was heading to the heavily guarded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound in the suburb of <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The spokesman said a militia patrol from President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was in the area, `` opened fire in the air too in an effort to stop <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s convoy to check what was happening.'' `` <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s bodyguards fired three bullets at the Phalangists in a white Mercedes-Benz and the patrol fired back. No casualties were reported among the Phalangist militiamen,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s car was hit with one bullet in the hood and the convoy continued on its way to the embassy,'' the spokesman added. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON>, foreign relations spokesman for the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, said a report by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> that the four kidnapped professors were believed to be in <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s hands was `` untrue and totally baseless. The four are Americans <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, and Indian <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. They were kidnapped on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Jan. 24, 1987. The Times also said that <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> had scheduled a news conference for this week and that `` there is understandable speculation that this may be to announce the hostages' release.'' `` Amal's standard policy denounces kidnapping,'' <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> said. An underground faction calling itself Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> claimed to have abducted the four educators and has demanded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free 400 Arab prisoners. Fourteen other foreigners are held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ six Americans, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman and two unidentified men. Most are believed to be held by Shiite extremists. The longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. In another development, police said three members of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, were wounded in a brief firefight with rival Shiite Moslem militiamen in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. Another police spokesman said the three Hezbollahis were injured in a five-minute exchange of fire with members of the Amal militia in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district. Syrian troops `` intervened and brought the firefight to an end,'' the spokesman said. The clash was the first reported between the two sides since <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed 2,400 troops in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday and Saturday, ending three weeks of clashes between the two rival militias that killed nearly 300 people and wounded 1,000. Amal, Arabic for Hope, accused <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> of provoking the clash and said the three wounded <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militiamen were armed with silencer-equipped pistols. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said Amal militiamen opened fire at the three `` unarmed'' Hezbollahis as they drove to Shiyah to check on their apartments.

 The Swedish navy detonated depth charges and anti-submarine grenades off the southern <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast Thursday in the second hunt this week for underwater prowlers.

At least 14 of the men trapped were Turkish immigrant workers. Some of the victims had survived the blast but died when their emergency masks ran out of oxygen, officials said. Family and friends had kept an all-night vigil in this mining town 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, waiting for the latest word on Wednesday's disaster, which officials attributed to a methane gas buildup. Today, rescue workers used extra-sensitive listening devices, searching without success for any signs of life or tapping. `` The chances of finding any survivors have sunk to zero,'' said <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state mining director <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, head of the Hesse state mining board, told reporters today that the explosion was caused by a methane gas buildup and said he feared none of the 57 miners who were 330 feet underground during the blast had survived. `` Rescue work is being hindered by heavy damage, and rescue teams can proceed only with oxygen masks,'' he said, explaining that there was still the danger of a methane gas buildup in the mine. <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said carbon monoxide levels inside the mine had receded, but were still severe. Some of the dead were found with their miners' breathing masks on, he said, which means they survived the blast and apparently ran out of air. The breathing devices provide about three hours' of oxygen. Other miners were killed by the explosion itself and will be hard to identify because of the extent of their injuries, <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said. The blast blew the roofs off at least three work buildings at the mine, knocked down sheds and shattered windows. Eight miners on the surface were critically injured by flying debris. `` My son <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> is down there. He's been a miner for 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, an elderly man who was waiting overnight at his son's house. `` God let him be alive. He has two small children,'' <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, brushing away tears, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In a building not far from the mine shaft, wives and other relatives of the missing workers were consoling each other, but even they expressed little hope their loved ones would be saved. `` That was an incredible explosion,'' said 60-year-old <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hettmanczyk </PERSON>, whose son-in-law <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiremba </PERSON> was among the missing. `` I do n't see how anyone could have survived,'' said the somber <PERSON> Hettmanczyk </PERSON>, who was going home after waiting hours for good news. Three rescue workers were being treated at a hospital after inhaling fumes from carbon monoxide that was released in the blast, but their lives were not in danger, Mayor <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. About 30 rescuers worked inside the mine through the night. Hundreds of others worked under floodlights above ground, pumping fresh air into the shaft and acting as support for the rescue teams. `` The air is very bad in there,'' said <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausmann </PERSON>, a blackened miner who was helping outside. `` Things do not look so good _ everything is blocked off.'' Most of the miners in the shaft at the time of the blast were in their 30s and 40s and some of them were Turks, officials said. Some relatives of the missing began leaving the mine area late Wednesday night as hopes faded. About 170 people had been employed at the brown-coal mine owned by <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, one of the largest West German utility companies. The mine is set in a field, with the nearest homes about 500 yards away.

 If you ca n't park, you may still be able to drive under new license rules being promulgated in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Parallel parking, that nemisis of beginning drivers, has been removed on a trial basis from requirements for a license, but some examiners are not pleased, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, district manager with the state Division of Motor Vehicles. `` Road tests are a lot like mom, apple pie and Chevrolet, and some people do n't like to see changes,'' he said. The parallel parking change is one of several designed to ease the job of license examiners and reduce waiting times for tests, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said. It became effective Wednesday. `` We do n't think that any of this will affect safety,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> added. Over the years, the state has instituted new tests that officials say more accurately check skills at such things as high-speed driving and lane-changing maneuvers. `` Most people do n't even use parallel parking any more,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said the changes would remain in effect at least through the summer and were made `` because we are in the service business.''

 Being the ambassador of soul is just as good as being an ambassador from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, according to a lawyer for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s wife.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Thursday appointed Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> acting commander-in-chief of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces after major military defeats on land and sea. The appointment increased the political power of the man Iranians call `` the shark.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who has held the title of commander-in-chief, gave <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> `` full authority'' to take over control of military affairs. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s appointment followed a disastrous confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and two defeats on the battlefield in which the Iraqis drove the Iranians out of their two main footholds inside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said in a commentary, `` It is hoped that this transfer of power will be the beginning of major developments on the battlefield.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to appoint <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as the `` only suitable person to be assigned this important responsibility ... to manage affairs ... in a decisive manner.'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> which, with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s approval, decides <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military strategy in the war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 53, is <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s representative on the council and has long been considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decision to hand over military power to one of his closest aides raised speculation that the revolutionary patriarch's health is deteriorating <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is 87 and has long been reported to be in poor health. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is now well-placed to emerge as the kingmaker in the power struggle, already under way, that will climax when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has designated <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> as his successor, but <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> does not have a significant power base and is opposed by many Iranian leaders. It is widely believed that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his allies will be the power behind the throne in the post-Khomeini era. Big gains by radicals, backed by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, in two-stage parliamentary elections in April and May at the expense of conservatives helped bolster <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s political influence. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, nicknamed `` the shark'' because of his political acumen, is expected to seek to galvanize <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military, dispirited after its defeats, and the nation's 50 million people who appear to be growing weary of the war. `` This appointment is highly significant. We're going to see a whole new ball game now,'' <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a military analyst with the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decree said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was ordered to set up a `` general command headquarters and organize the full coordination of the armed forces, the Revolutionary Guards, the security forces and volunteer mobilization forces.'' That suggested an intensified effort to weld <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military forces into a more cohesive force than they have been. Deep-rooted rivalry between the increasingly powerful <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the regular army, still tainted by its links to the late shah, have bedeviled military strategy for years. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is closely linked with the 350,000-man Revolutionary Guards, known as Pasdaran. Its main commanders, <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafiq-Doust </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezai </PERSON>, are both staunch <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> supporters. Diplomats with contacts in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> reported that the relative ease with which the Iraqis overran the Iranians in the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> of southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> April 18 and at a bridgehead east of the port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on May 25 was a severe jolt to the Iranian hierarchy. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s appointment came as military analysts expected the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy to reassess its strategy of attrition against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> following <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s twin defeats. Changes had been expected to accelerate after radicals and militants, many of them <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s allies, made major gains in the parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decree, as broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, stressed the need for `` complete unity'' in the armed forces and the need to reorganize logistics, military-related industry and training toward `` specific objectives.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> declared <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was `` at war'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or disabled six Iranian vessels, including two frigates, in clashes in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on April 18. After the loss of Faw, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> replaced the armed forces chief of staff, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohrabi </PERSON>, with a little-known officer, Col. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahbazi </PERSON>, and promoted him to Brigadier General. Western military analysts said at the time that `` more heads are expected to roll.'' But the Iranians have not announced any other command changes. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said in a speech read out at the inauguration of the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week that the war would be decided on the battlefield, not the negotiating table. That indicated the revolutionary patriarch was determined to avenge the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> defeats. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s victories meant it was now conceivable that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, having gone onto the offensive after years of static defense, could break the stalemate in the ground war

 <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has not closed the door to the use of its herbicide `` spike'' in a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program to spray <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> coca bushes, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman said today. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, whose House Government Operations panel is reviewing the battle against illegal drugs, said he spoke to company representatives after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized the company during a hearing Wednesday. He said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> officials have objected to use of the chemical tebuthiuron, known as `` spike,'' because `` they have not done the proper testing of application by air over a wide section of countryside. They have no data. They have not seen data from -LRB- the -RRB- State -LRB- Department -RRB-, and can not assume responsibility or liability.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Indianapolis-based company, had no immediate comment on English's statement. But he did say that the chemical is applied both by air and on the ground in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He described tebuthiuron as `` a broad-spectrum, soil-applied herbicide for brush and weed control on non-cropland, pasture and rangeland.'' The herbicide is `` approved for use in grazing lands, wildlife openings along ditchbanks, and utility rights of way. It is safe for humans, livestock, wildlife and the environment when used according to label directions.'' English, an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Democrat, said: `` We will continue discussions. We need to acquire a herbicide against coca bushes as quickly as possible. At this point, my own perception is the door is open, discussions will continue, and hopefully a solution can be found to this particular problem.'' English's statement was toned down considerably from his comment Wednesday that <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> was `` a deserter'' in the war on drugs. The congressman later clarified his remarks to say there had not been proper aerial testing in the coca-producing region of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where the chemical would be sprayed. He said the area has considerable groundwater and therefore is much different from the dry, brush areas where it is used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He added that the company also was concerned that the coca area in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> `` may not be in friendly hands, and you may not have a pilot totally concentrating on the accuracy of spraying.'' At Wednesday's hearing, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, criticized <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> for deciding to withhold the herbicide from the spraying program _ even though it has been manufactured for more than 15 years, has been proven safe by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards, is widely available in this country and has been sold to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Wednesday, `` We think the short-term impact is serious.'' The department wanted to test the chemical for use in eradicating the coca crop focused mainly in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, she said. The chemical is used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for clearing brush. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> apparently was worried about possible retaliatory measures by `` traffickers or terrorists.'' The company also came under pressure from environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of the herbicide. Meanwhile, the subcommittee was told by agencies fighting the drug war on Wednesday that the effort is troubled by delayed equipment and financial woes. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said its boats and planes often sit idle because the agency is short of money. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> remains a haven for airborne drug smugglers because of delays in installing four of five radar balloons. Also, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> surveillance planes have cracks in their wings and may be grounded this summer. New or modified planes authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have not yet been delivered. Construction of three new command, control, communications and intelligence centers for the drug war are behind schedule. English blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the delays in installing the radar balloons along the Mexican border to detect airborne drug smugglers. Only one of the five balloons, called aerostats, is in operation. `` This is a terrible failure,'' he told <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief. `` You are costing us dearly. There's no sense of urgency about this. That's the problem.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said his new, fast patrol boats and many of the agency's airplanes are operating at only 55 percent of last year's levels due to lack of money. He said it was ironic that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is ready to spend huge sums for an escalation of the military's role in the drug war, but ca n't find $ 60 million to get his vessels in the water and planes in the air full time `` Turn me loose and do n't give my mission away,'' he told the committee. <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> blamed the radar balloon delays on problems with site selection, environmental concerns, competitive bidding and bureaucratic roadblocks from other federal agencies. When he explained how he spent four months seeking competitive bids for the balloons in an effort to save money, English said, `` In effect, you cost us a heck of a lot of money'' because <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> AWACS surveillance planes have had to patrol the Mexican border to pick up the slack. English said that an AWACS costs $ 7,500 an hour to operate.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s request to include the words `` peaceful coexistence'' in a closing summit statement because the phrase is imprecise and it was a Soviet slogan during the Cold War, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> disagreed over use of the phrase, and that the pair was `` going at it pretty heavy until the end.'' <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> used the phrase to describe his efforts to improve relations with the West following the death of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1953, but stuck with it despite the heightened tension of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and Cuban missile crises. It seems as if there are two dictionaries when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> analyze the meaning of peaceful coexistence. A senior official, who spoke to reorters on condition that she not be further identified, said that shortly after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last Sunday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> handed him a plain white piece of paper on which were written the following words: `` Proceeding from their understanding of the realities that have taken shape in the world today, the two leaders believe that no problem in dispute can be resolved, nor should it be resolved, by military means.'' The statement continued: `` They regard peaceful coexistence as a universal principle of international relations. Equality of all states, non-interference in internal affairs, and freedom of socio-political choice must be recognized as the inalienable and mandatory standards of international relations.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> liked the sound of the words, but the veteran Sovietologists who advise him remembered that the Soviets were proclaiming similar principles in international affairs in the context of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956, <LOCATION> Czecholovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, and that the Soviets countenanced the declaration of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, talking to reporters who accompanied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Thursday aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, described the scene at the final Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, about six hours before the summit communique was released to the press: `` As the meeting ended, all of us stood up, including the president and the general secretary, and the president and general secretary continued to pursue their conversation. `` They were going at it pretty heavy and I was proud of the president. They were face to face and going at it pretty heavy until the end.'' At his <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked why he took issue with the `` peaceful coexistence'' language. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he liked `` the whole tone'' of the draft language. But the president also said that aides studying the draft communique `` saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in there that would not achieve the general thought of what was being proposed.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were suspicious about the language, feeling it was too imprecise. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections were brought to the attention of the Soviets early on, and negotiations began at the staff level on alternative language, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` And indeed, it was our impression that alternative language had been agreed to for the departure statement,'' he said. `` And it was at the last meeting -LRB- that -RRB- the general secretary came back and made another run at trying to get his original language in. And the president held his ground.'' `` I do n't think he -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- was playing a trick. I think he was just making a run for his original formulation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In the end, the compromise language negotiated by the staff _ omitting the words peaceful coexistence _ was included in the communique.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> history professor with a passion for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national parks told their superintendents today they are stewards of the world's greatest university. `` I take the national park service of any society as a series of symbols about what a people chose to take pride in,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winks </PERSON> told 300 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> managers on the second day of an extraordinary, four-day conference. `` These are the testimonials, the building blocks that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe they have done historically. You begin to get into a heart of a people by viewing what they have chosen to preserve,'' said <PERSON> Winks </PERSON>, who has visited 315 of the 342 units of the National Park system and is a frequent participant in park service training sessions. `` Every superintendent in the National Park system is president of a small university, keeping the flame of an historical event of which we are proud,'' Winks said. `` You are stewards over what I view as the single greatest university of the world.'' On Wednesday, park managers at the first such conference in 12 years said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national parks are in better condition than ever. Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> and others agreed that budget constraints have forced them to find new solutions to old problems, such as deteriorating maintenance and substandard housing. Environmental and citizens' groups have said threats to the parks include logging, oil drilling, pollution and commercial and residential development near parks. `` I get tired of all this ` Chicken Little' stuff,'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> told reporters. `` We've made a lot of improvements. `` There is more control and management of the resources and some people do n't like that because they do n't like control, but the good side of that is ... we are more sensitive to the integrity of the resources than we have ever been,'' said <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, whose park, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, was the world's first national park. `` I would contend that in Yellowstone -LRB- National Park -RRB-, biologically, today we are in better shape than we were 75 years ago,'' he said. He noted that 75 years ago a dairy herd, slaughterhouses, garbage dumps and other things needed to support staff and park visitors produced tons of pollution. `` As late as 1970, 80,000 pounds of wet garbage _ pizza crusts and slop _ was available to bears in open dumps. Now there are zero pounds of wet garbage, the dumps are gone, it's all hauled long distances out of the park,'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s physical plant is also in better shape than it's ever been, even though an estimated $ 300 million is needed to repair deteroriated facilities. At Grand Canyon National Park, wild burros were once a problem, said Superintendent <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>. `` Today there are no burros in the park, the Big Horn sheep are making a comeback'' and conflicts between people on the ground and those making canyon overflights `` are being worked out,'' <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said. During the far-ranging session with reporters, <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> denied accusations by critics in environmental groups and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he may have held back his best professional advice because of admininstrative opposition. `` No one, not even -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, has personally throttled me on what I personally feel,'' said <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>. The administration's commitment to the parks system was one of the issues discussed earlier in the day. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> for Fish, Wildlife and <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, said he was tired of `` a continuing drumbeat of critics claiming the administration is anti-park and committers of sins.'' He pointed out that the administration has proposed a $ 734 million operating budget for the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the next fiscal year, compared to $ 391 million in 1980. `` That constitutes the largest operating budget in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and represents 29 percent post-inflation, real growth over the past seven years,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. Further, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employs 16,414 people, the highest level in its 72-year history, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` These numbers bespeak a commitment to a first-class national park system,'' he said.

 Republican conservatives questioned Thursday what Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hoped to gain politically by attacking two new-right activists whom he called `` self-appointed spokesmen'' who have been critical of him for years. The objects of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> _ said they still hope he defeats Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall presidential election. `` With <PERSON> George </PERSON> so far down in the polls I was wondering why he was wasting his time and energy shooting at me instead of shooting at <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he wants to go around attacking conservatives, he's going to dig himself a deeper hole,'' said <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, a conservative fund-raiser and former publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>. Recent national polls have said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is leading <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by margins ranging from six points to 16 points among voters. Conservatives have urged the vice president to step up his attacks on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and portray him as a liberal out of step with the national mood. <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also have been sharply critical of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> since he took office more than seven years ago. They have complained that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has abandoned much of the conservative agenda. Only Wednesday, <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as having `` taken leave of his senses'' for suggesting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the problems Soviet citizens were having emigrating to the West were caused more by bureaucratic problems than government policy. Interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> at his summer home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, `` The fact that he does n't agree with me on a lot of things or has opposed me for many years, that does n't bother me. `` There's only one or two that polarize, and <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> are two of them. It does n't matter in terms of total vote.'' When asked if he needed to court the two new-right activists, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There are some people that are almost self-appointed spokesmen that will make a claim for that. I do n't feel that at all.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> `` gets his name in the paper by criticizing other Republicans all the time.'' `` I think it's kind of sad,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a conservative supporter of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I was hoping he would n't react to their earlier goading. ... I thought the whole thing was calmed down and we'd all be pulling together on one team.'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> was `` absolutely correct'' in urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to get tougher on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> does n't paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the liberal that he is and establish himself as a conservative then the electorate is going to opt for a change,'' said <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>. `` It does n't serve <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> any useful purpose to attack people who have constituencies that might support him,'' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director. At the same time, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> `` has been a vicious attacker of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over the last seven years.'' `` He's not running against <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and he's not running against <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>; he's running against probably <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball,'' said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, asked how much of a following he has, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` does not have to worry about me, I only have one vote.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> has several hundred thousand supporters. `` Even though I'm not a great fan of the vice president or his policies, I genuinely hope he succeeds,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` I want all of us to unite behind him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, who added that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` does n't run a polarizing election, he's history ... If he does n't run a campaign to polarize, that polarizes the country along liberal and conservative lines then he has no chance of winning.''

 Image may have overwhelmed substance here this week, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials believe the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit will be remembered for building a foundation of openness and trust for future U.S.-Soviet relations. `` Military issues are the most important and here, progress was thin,'' said one American participant in five days of summit talks between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It was uncertain whether arms talks will result in agreement on a new treaty drastically reducing strategic nuclear weapons before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January. That is the two leaders' condition for holding a fifth and final summit meeting this year. `` But there has been a sea change in atmospherics,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said privately. He noted that `` we are talking with them across the board'' from missile cutbacks to cultural exchanges. `` If we are going to build a future relationship, these will be the building blocks,'' he said. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat with years of experience in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs said the Americans are `` feeling more confident about the relationship'' after the summit. He, too, spoke only on condition he not be identified. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> spokesmen made their own upbeat assessment of glasnost-era summitry. `` If someone had told me three years ago that we would have such relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I would have said it was a fantasy,'' said <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A.-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said on a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> interview that `` we do have progress, but we could have even more.'' To television viewers, the summit may have seemed designed to produce scenes of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> clasping hands and grinning at each other. There were some TV images unfavorable to the Soviets _ <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents roughing up the White House press corps a few hours after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived; police sealing off the apartment of a Jewish activist whom <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intended to visit. There also were favorable Soviet images _ an aging <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alongside a bright-eyed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> more than 10 years his junior; <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urging a faster pace in arms control negotiations while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> counsels caution. Behind the images, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet aides were busy bargaining over a far wider range of issues than their predecessors during the days of East-West detente in the 1970s. `` We are finding greater openness than we have in the past,'' said the American official. Negotiators made only marginal progress this week on a proposed treaty to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons by as much as 50 percent. They talked, too, about two lesser agreements that would tighten verification procedures under a 1974 accord limiting nuclear explosions and require advance notice of ballistic missile tests. The two sides also made little headway on resolving differences over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other regional conflicts. But they signed a handful of agreements on minor issues such as maritime rescue and radar navigation. In all the talks, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, the Soviets blamed past mistakes on `` old thinking'' and tried to use what they called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` new thinking'' to make things work. Among the summit's little-noticed achievements, in the view of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participants, was overcoming initial Soviet objections to a cultural agreement to exchange as many as 1,000 high school students from each country. `` In the past, the Soviets had objected to allowing Soviet students to stay in American homes and Americans to stay with Soviet families,'' said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. He said the exchange students could become of the next generation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet foreign policy experts.

 About 200 capitalists converged Thursday on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a weekend of caviar on the Great Wall, boat rides on an imperial pleasure lake and a display of opulence not seen in this spartan socialist capital since 1949. The participants, from 21 countries, are spending $ 4,300 each to enjoy such Western luxuries as a masked ball and champagne breakfast at sites of past Chinese imperial glory. For $ 5,200 more, 100 of them will spend 10 days touring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous scenic spots The weekend event, dubbed `` The Return of Marco Polo'' after the 13th century Venetian adventurer, was organized by a French group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Save <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and the Great Wall, headed by public relations agent <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vial </PERSON>. The proceeds were intended to help restore the Great Wall, reduced in many sections by weather and war to a heap of stones, and to preserve the art and architecture of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. But Vial said Chinese officials are charging such high fees for transportation, food, site rentals and services that most of the ticket receipts will be needed to cover expenses. He cited a $ 54,000 charge by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> municipal authorities to rent a section of the Great Wall for four hours Saturday so the guests can lunch there on caviar and champagne. `` I'm not sure they -LRB- Chinese officials -RRB- got exactly the concept of a charity,'' Vial told a news conference this week. `` They charge us the maximum.'' The number of high-paying guests also is less than half what was expected, Vial acknowledged. He said Chinese delays in confirming arrangements made it impossible to advertise far enough in advance. The organizers now say any funds to help the Great Wall or <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> will have to come from the final event of the weekend, a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction Sunday of donated modern Western and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> art and rare objects. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s has estimated the 67 items, including a 1777 bottle of cognac, a pottery jug painted by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and a painting by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, the daughter of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, should fetch $ 695,400 to $ 869,000. However, auctioneer <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said no one is really sure what to expect It will be the first auction of Western art in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the Communist takeover in 1949. The cheapest item in the sale is expected to be a Sevres porcelain cup valued from $ 215 to $ 320 _ about how much an average Chinese factory worker earns annually. Despite uncertainty about how much will be reaped for charity, plenty of cash wiil flash during the weekend. The guests will be ferried about in black Red Flag limousines, entertained by Chinese acrobats and singers, fed on caviar, French cuisine and brandy and allowed to party at some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most sacred national monuments. They will boat at the luxurious 19th century Summer Palace and hold a Venetian masked ball and watch fireworks at the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> state guesthouse. They will breakfast at the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heaven </ORGANIZATION>, where the emperor offered sacrifices for a good harvest, dine in the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the imperial palace in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and watch Chinese and Western performers Saturday night at the Great Hall of the People. The guests gathered Thursday night at the weekend's first event, a cocktail party in the garden of the glass-plated <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, serenaded by Chinese musicians playing ancient instruments. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman, asked why he was willing to pay so much, said with a shrug, `` To have fun.'' `` We are not in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> now,'' said a Frenchman who, like the American, spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It's as if we are in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' Organizers said several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nobility signed up for the weekend, but most of those at the party seemed to be involved in business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police will shield the guests from contact with ordinary <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents, among whom the main topic of conversation lately has been 30 to 60 percent increases in the prices of pork, eggs and sugar. Former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>, when asked at the cocktail party if such displays of wealth were appropriate in impoverished <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, call income differences `` an objective reality.'' `` We are trying to make our country prosperous,'' he said. `` We need all kinds of help.''

 A <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> man has been charged in the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 6-year-old girl more than a year ago, and a judge has dismissed charges against a man who had been convicted of the crimes. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Headley </PERSON>, 31, of Snowville, was arrested Wednesday and was being held in the Box Elder County Jail in lieu of $ 75,000 bail. He was to be arraigned Thursday on one count each of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, child kidnapping and aggravated kidnapping, all first-degree felonies, said a secretary to Box Elder County Attorney <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 45, <PERSON> Elma </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting the child and was sentenced to 16 years in prison, but was released on his own recognizance in January, pending a new trial after authorities said they had uncovered a new suspect. First District Judge <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON> on Wednesday dismissed charges against <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, the judge's clerk said. The girl was kidnapped March 24, 1987, from outside a school and was released the following morning in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, about 65 miles away. She told police she had been abducted by a man driving a four-door blue car with a dachshund in it. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> was arrested at a rest stop on Interstate 15 near <PERSON> Corrine </PERSON>. He was driving a four-door blue car with a dachshund in the back. During the trial last August, the girl could not identify <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> as her abductor. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> had contended he was at the Juniper, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, rest stop at the time of the abduction, and an attendant testified he remembered seeing a man resembling <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> shaving at the rest stop at that time. The child picked <PERSON> Headley </PERSON> out of a recent photo lineup, according to a probable cause statement accompanying the charges.

 The new chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division said Thursday he looks forward to the release of a report detailing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ties to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project `` I think it will be much better for all concerned when that report is issued, the sooner the better, for the department and for the attorney general,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, told reporters. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> will conclude a year-long invesitgation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by filing a report in the next week of two with three-judge federal appeals court panel, which is expected to issue it publicly later this month. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said issuing the report `` will be very good because right now you just have a lot of speculation.'' He said making the report public will give <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> an opportunity to respond to any allegations in detail. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he wants to respond to all the information in the report to `` clear the air.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who is in his first week on the job as acting assistant attorney general said morale in the criminal division is good despite <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems and a wave of departures from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the past two months. `` It's not easy in a situation where you do have controversy and uncertainty to be without someone to kind of keep the division's oar in the water,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a former chief of the narcotic and dangerous drug section at the department <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> sidestepped when asked whether colleagues urged him not to take his new assignment. `` My feeling is basically if there were n't problems, there'd be no need for lawyers,'' he said. `` That's basically what we do, deal with controversy and problems.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said that since he already knows many people in the criminal division and is `` a known commodity,'' his nomination `` has done a great deal to perhaps calm any concerns.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said he has spoken briefly to his predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who quit in protest March 29 out of concern that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, morale and public image <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said he will probably have lunch with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> soon. In a recent conversation, he said, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> did n't say why he resigned, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> did n't ask him why and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> did n't offer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> any advice. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report is expected to raise questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical conduct that will be examined by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> in the coming months, sources familiar with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation have <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also has been examining <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s meetings with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> company executives while holding $ 14,000 in phone stock and has been delving into a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate family providing funds for a job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> and leasing buildings to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>State Broadcasting Company Says Dukakis Bows To Black Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state-run broadcasting company charged Thursday that pressure by blacks prompted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to accuse <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of terrorism. The accusation by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic nominee, had no factual basis and `` was quite openly a capitulation to threats that black voters' support would depend on his making such a statement,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in an editorial. It was the latest in a wave of attacks by right-wing and mainstream news media on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians campaigning to toughen sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Several commentators have suggested that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> should shift attention to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Far East and abandon hope of any constructive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings. A <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> brokerage firm, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Borkum </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, reported Thursday that one proposal in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would force the sale of $ 7 billion of U.S.-held shares in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s mining companies. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens held 14.2 percent of all South African mining shares as of Jan. 1. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has developed `` appropriate counter-strategies'' to combat the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, the broadcast commentary said. A pro-goverment <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper, The Citizen, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` will be in for a lot of trouble'' if the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor becomes president. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been easily swayed by the likes of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, and he will do everything he can to try and strangle the South African economy,'' The Citizen said in an editorial Wednesday. `` But this son of immigrant parents should know that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> have deep-seated roots in this country that go back more than three centuries and they will not give in to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands nor submit to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions,'' it said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of terrorist acts but has not called it a terrorist state, as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has urged him to do. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, leader of the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during a recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trip and endorsed sanctions pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Pro-government media have denounced the black cleric, saying he has no mandate and ignores the harm which sanctions might inflict on blacks. An accurate assessment of black views on sanctions is difficult to obtain because the 26 million blacks can not vote in national elections or referendums, and public advocacy of sanctions is forbidden under emergency regulations. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Business Day, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper reflecting the views of moderate business executives, has carried several articles assailing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals. The sanctions would cut off virtually all bilateral economic activity, except for trade in certain strategic minerals. The newspaper reported that the proposals include a section that says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not provide advice to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the event of a nuclear accident.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has said at least 100 times that he could n't accept the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for vice president because he would have to turn over his office to the Democratic lieutenant governor. The governor's protests notwithstanding, he remains an attractive vice presidential prospect as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tries to keep <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with its 47 electoral votes, in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> column in November. `` As I've said many times now,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said of the vice presidency a few weeks ago, `` I do n't expect even to be asked, but if I was asked, if I am asked, I can not accept it. `` If I were on the -LRB- national -RRB- ticket and that ticket was to be successful, it would mean turning over the entire executive branch of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state government to the other party, which I'm not about to do.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters, who cast separate ballots for governor and lieutenant governor, have saddled <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> with a Democrat in the No. 2 spot in state government, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, however, is running this year for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and would not necessarily be <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s successor. But that does n't ease the governor's problem, because the next person in line is another Democrat, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON> But <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> continues to fan speculation with comments such as these to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> GOP fundraiser: `` I'm still hoping that somebody might come along and figure out a way I could be vice president and at the same time -LRB- let -RRB- the Republicans hold onto control of the statehouse in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' The importance to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of winning <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is enormous, and it is clear that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs help in the Golden State despite <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lasting popularity here. Although <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has ended up in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> column in eight of the last nine presidential elections, a Californian has been on the Republican ticket, either for president or vice president, in six of those races. The most recent presidential election in which there was not a Californian on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket was the 1976 race between Republican <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> carried <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by a scant 1.7 percent. Although the prospect of <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> turning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> statehouse over to a Democrat is strongly opposed by state Republican party leaders, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters have given pollsters mixed signals that they would probably be more inclined to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> were on the ticket with him. In a late May survey, <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poll </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 53 percent to 40 percent. But Field said a Bush-Deukmejian ticket narrowed that margin only to 51-41 against a <PERSON> Dukakis-John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> ticket, and that a Bush-Deukmejian ticket led <PERSON> Dukakis-Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis-Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tickets by 2 and 7 points respectively. On the positive side, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> is the son of immigrant parents who arrived from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> nearly penniless at <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the early 1900s, a background that could help counter the ethnic appeal of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and add a humble background to balance <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s image of Eastern wealth and preppiness. The 59-year-old <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s other political assets include a strongly favorable rating in his home state _ 61 percent positive to 31 percent negative in a May survey. He has a scandal-free reputation as a family man and hard-working administrator, and a political image as a fiscal conservative and law-and-order former attorney general. His most noteworthy achievement as governor was pulling the state through the crisis of a $ 1.5 billion deficit inherited from Democratic predecessor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> without a general tax increase. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> faces a similar crisis this year, a revenue shortfall estimated at $ 2.3 billion over two years. He has been criticized for his proposed solution, a package of spending cuts, dipping into treasury reserves and $ 800 million in new state income tax revenues that he insists are an `` adjustment'' or `` correction'' and not a tax increase. His greatest liability may be what even his friends concede is a bland speaking style and image, a problem that also plagues <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Altogether, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a native of Menards, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has spent 26 years in public office in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ 16 in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, where he was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> floor leader for six years prior to his 1978 election as attorney general. He was elected governor by 93,000 votes in 1982 and re-elected by a landslide 1.7 million vote margin in 1986.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stood eyeball-to-eyeball this week with Soviet journalists who tested the uncharted bounds of glasnost, and he never blinked. Never had a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader held a news conference on home territory until Wednesday, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed to take questions from 300 Soviet and foreign reporters and government officials here for his summit talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The five Soviet journalists chosen to ask questions were polite and ideologically acceptable. But they raised issues that could never have been addressed publicly by Soviet citizens only three years ago. Articulate and in easy command of the occasion, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deftly handled such sensitive topics as war losses in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, past Soviet stubbornness at arms negotiations and the need for a greater degree of democracy in Soviet society. By White House standards, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s news conference was windy _ it lasted two hours _ and disorganized. The order of the two dozen questions was more random than under the White House formula, which awards the first query to a wire service reporter at news conferences that seldom last longer than a half-hour. Soviet journalists are still committed advocates of official policy, but their reporting on the summit and the questions they asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reflected a freer attitude. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talked openly about the once-taboo subject of internal disputes within the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. He explained his problems with foot-dragging conservatives until Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> whispered that the Soviet journalist was asking about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> factions that are hesitant about improving superpower relations. `` You mean you're talking not about our conservatives but their conservatives?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked magazine editor <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berezhkov </PERSON>. The auditorium erupted in laughter. The reporters' questions and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s responses would have been unthinkable before the Soviet leader introduced his reforms in early 1985. When a correspondent for the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> rose to ask <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about the fate of about 300 Soviet soldiers reportedly seized by Afghan rebels and held captive in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Without a hint of discomfort, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded with the sincerity of a concerned father that `` we will do everything so that our people return home.'' The most delicate queries were posed by foreign reporters, who outnumbered their Soviet counterparts by at least 2-to-1 and were allowed to ask the most questions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave a self-assured response even to the most sensitive questions about his relationship with KreqE @ oO __ oo @ O @ <PERSON> Wgor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who is reported to be challenging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> over the pace of reforms, and the inflammatory remarks of <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief who called Monday for <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not fully answer some questions, such as whether the June 28 party conference could prove contentious, but he never refused outright to respond to a query. <PERSON> Melor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON>, a correspondent for the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> who was expelled from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a tit-for-tat exchange in 1983, commented during one question that the Soviet side had hampered negotiations over verification procedures during arms talks at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader agreed with <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON>'s assessment, but attributed current difficulties to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intransigence. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the reporters he had enjoyed the opportunity to talk with them, hinting that his first <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference might not be his last.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the memories are still fresh from four decades ago when he played first base for <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in baseball's College World Series. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely GOP presidential nominee, played for the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> team that finished second in the series in 1947 and 1948, losing to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> the first year and to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> the next. He reminisced about the experience _ and recalled a fatally flawed bit of strategy _ in a recent letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> which had asked about his College World Series days. The 1988 series begins Friday, its 39th consecutive year here. The 1947 and 1948 series were in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The 1948 tournament was `` the highlight of my college baseball experience,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. `` We had great college pitching,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> was a real star. He signed right after the'48 season with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> for a big bonus. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Manville </PERSON>, another pitcher, was major-league material, too.'' `` Competition really is great,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` Being part of a winning team is a thrill. Teamwork is very important. Fitness, of course, matters. `` I still clear the head by running two miles, and riding an exercycle on bad days. I have always loved sports.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also recalled some <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> strategy that backfired in 1947. `` We walked the eighth hitter to get to the ninth hitter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` That turned out to be their pitcher. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, later of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> fame, strode to the plate and hit one that's still rolling out there.''

 A 2,000-foot TV tower collapsed today, killing two maintenance workers and apparently trapping a third in the wreckage, police said. `` It's just a tangled pile of metal,'' said C.L. <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>, a dispatcher with the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. `` They are getting cutting torches in there to try and cut it out.'' The maintenance crew was working at about 500 feet when the tower as high as a 200-story building gave way around 10 a.m., authorities said. The bodies of two of the workers were found within an hour of the collapse, the patrol said. Colony is about 25 miles from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> borders and 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The patrol said the cause of the accident was not immediately known. Winds were calm when the tower belonging to <ORGANIZATION> KTVO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kirksville </LOCATION> fell, said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, station news director. The transmission tower went up in September and was one of the tallest in the nation, visible from more than 30 miles, authorities said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>, KTVO general manager, said the workers were replacing more than 1,000 structural braces. `` I ca n't even venture a guess as to what happened,'' said <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>. `` At this point, I do n't know why it fell. It was very tragic that human life was lost.'' <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, who lives about a quarter mile from the tower, said she looked out her window and saw the structure falling. It did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area but tore down several trees, witnesses said. `` I heard it and it sounded like a jet taking off,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>. The workers were employees of <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and had been working in Colony for several weeks. <ORGANIZATION> KTVO </ORGANIZATION> was off the air following the collapse. An FM radio station that also broadcast from the tower, <ORGANIZATION> KRXL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kirksville </LOCATION>, was working on reduced power, authorities said. The tower was the maximum height allowed under <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rules, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, public service specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 In the beginning, play was hard work. You ran, you wrestled, you clambered up cliffs with your bare hands. Then came video games. You walked over to the TV, picked up the joystick and let <PERSON> Donkey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kong </PERSON> climb the wall. Still too much work. Couch potatoes, rejoice! The wireless joystick, a device that will allow you to sit in your La-Z-Boy more than 20 feet from the tube while playing After Burner, is coming. `` It's really the ultimate stick,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations of <ORGANIZATION> Camerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which will market the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stick </ORGANIZATION>. The arcade-style stick bounces an infrared beam around a room, linking up with a receiver at the television set. The manufacturer says the signal is not interrupted when someone walks by; there are no wires; it is compatible with all game systems; it works whether it is aimed at the ceiling, the floor, or up to 90 degrees from the screen. This is not the first time such a mechanism was marketed. A few years ago, a wireless joystick that used radio waves failed because the signal was easily disrupted, interrupting countless games of Pac Man. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leung </PERSON>, associate professor at <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, began developing the technology for the infrared joystick in 1981, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Camerica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leung </PERSON>'s research was proceeding apace when the video boom went bust. Instead of video games, people bought computers with video-game capabilities. But <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> said this has changed in the past year with the development of cheaper, more sophisticated video games. At the same time, parents found that computers were expensive playthings and game sets grew more attractive. The Freedom Stick will cost $ 69.95. <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said video-game makers are working to develop their own versions of the wireless device.

<TEXT>
 `` This absolutely blew my mind,'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON> said. `` I thought something awful was happening to me. Everytime I went into an examining room, I had a patient with ovarian cyst.'' Eventually, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gynecologist said, `` the lights began to go on'' and he concluded there was a connection between an outbreak of functional _ or non-cancerous _ cysts among his patients and a new type birth control pill he had been prescribing for them. Sold by three of the six major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceutical companies that make birth control pills, the so-called multiphasic pills that went on the market in 1984 actually were not new chemical formulations, but rather new packaging of existing drugs in various strengths. Although <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON> did n't have overall estimates of how many millions of women are taking the multiphasic pills, he said the introduction of the pills was accompanied by the most aggressive marketing program he has seen in 29 years of practice. By 1987, he said, nine of every 10 new birth control prescriptions were for a multiphasic. Largely through the efforts of <LOCATION> Caillouette </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the three companies to intensify their post-market studies of the pills. The agency is airing the issue before an advisory committee on Friday. Specifically, the fertility and maternal health drugs advisory committee will be asked whether it believes `` it is possible to determine at the present time if monophasic and multiphasic formulations of oral contraceptives have different associations with the occurrence of functional ovarian cysts.'' The panel also will be asked whether it is willing to express a preference between monophasic and multiphasic pills. In a monophasic prescription, the same dosage is taken each day of the 21-day cycle. In a multiphasic, the dosage varies, with a woman taking perhaps 35 microgram pills on certain days of the month, 20 micograms on other days and 10 micograms on still others. The rationale given by drug companies for developing the multiphasic pills was to minimize any side-effects by providing the lowest total dosage possible over the one-month cycle. It has been presumed, based on studies, that birth control pills reduce the likelihood of functional ovarian cysts, rather than increase them. That is why <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON> was so surprised when it dawned on him in early 1986 that each of seven patients who had developed cysts during the previous four months had been taking multiphasic pills. He recalled one patient in particular who had three operations in three months to remove the cysts `` and we kept putting her back on the triphasic pill beause she said with the others that she had breast tenderness, premenstrual syndrome and all of that.'' `` I believed what I was being told,'' <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` We knew that with patients on birth control pills, functional cysts were suppressed. After three surgeries in three months, the lights began to go on.'' So Caillouette put that patient and others with cysts back on single-dosage birth control pills. `` The cysts went away and I thought, ` This is what is supposed to happen,''' he said. `` But something is going on with these phasic pills.'' <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON>, who also is a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, decided to present his seven case studies during a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> medical meeting `` and following my presentation, physicians got up from the audience and presented an additional 11 cases.'' He published his findings in a medical journal last summer and began getting still more calls and letters from other physicians and patients having similar experiences with multiphasic birth control pills. <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON> said he now knows of 68 cases in which there is a potential link between multiphasic pills and functional cysts. <PERSON> Caillouette </PERSON> said he believes development of the multiphasic pills was a `` business decision on the part of the three companies to enter into new patent protection on birth control pills.'' But rather than develop new formulations, he said the companies either `` mixed or matched pills that were off the shelf'' or in some instances merely repackaged pills of varying strength into new monthly prescriptions. `` They came out with a new patent with what they advertised to the public as a new kind of birth control pill,'' he said. `` I think it was improper.

<HEAD>One-Third of Trauma Victims Used Marijuana Before Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than one-third of the patients at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trauma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> used marijuana several hours before sustaining their injuries, a study has found. Another third had been drinking alcohol before they were hurt, and 16.5 percent had been both drinking and smoking marijuana, according to the study appearing in the June issue of Archives of Surgery. `` To me, it was rather startling to see that an illicit drug matched in use a legal drug,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON>, a surgeon who headed the research team from the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. `` The suggestion is that the use of this drug alone and in combination with alcohol may be the reason why they got hurt and ended up hurting someone else,'' <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON> said. The study, based on leftover blood samples collected from July 29, 1985, to May 8, 1986, provided a `` phenomenally high number of positives for marijuana,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cone </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a common misconception that marijuana is a safe drug. But the statistics coming out of that study clearly show that people who are using marijuana are involved in accidents at a much higher rate than you would expect,'' <PERSON> Cone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON> said more studies need to be done, since the marijuana use rate he detected was four to 10 times as great as the rate reported in previous studies of car crash victims in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON>'s study is based on blood samples from 1,023 patients treated at the shock-trauma center. About two thirds had been involved in car crashes, while the others suffered their injuries in falls, assaults and accidents. About 73 percent were men and 58.4 percent were 30 or younger. The results showed 34.7 percent of the patients tested had used marijuana and 33.5 percent were under the influence of alcohol. <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON> said that of 393 drivers admitted, 1 in 6 had both marijuana and alcohol in their systems. More than three-quarters of those who drank registered blood-alcohol levels equal to or higher than the 0.1 level commonly used to determine drunkenness. <PERSON> Soderstrom </PERSON> said blood sample testing, or radioimmunoassay, rarely registers positive levels more than four hours after use of marijuana.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Defends Soviet Human Rights Record

<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed Thursday there will be no changes in his country's human rights policies despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emphasis on this issue during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Hours after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the end of the five-day summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told several hundred peace activists the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` will not accept any advice on how we run our affairs.'' `` We do not need anyone else's model. We do not need anyone else's values,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> highlighted human rights by meeting with dissidents and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> refuseniks during his visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and by stressing the issues of freedom of expression and economic creativity in speeches and his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also ran into trouble with some refuseniks for remarks he made later in the visit seeming to absolve <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of responsibility for Jewish emigration restricrtions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, told a news conference Wednesday he was `` not filled with admiration'' for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with the dissidents and refuseniks. But Thursday, he told the several hundred peace activists gathered in the circular blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Sverdlov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> building of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> that he felt the need to respond further. `` We are far from imagining our country perfect in all respects,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said that problems which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentioned `` do take place, but this is not the situation. This is not an overall picture of Soviet society.'' `` I told the president that we have our own view of the human rights situation in his own country,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said the two countries told a working group formed to tackle the problem that `` we're open and ready for any discussion on this matter.'' About 4,500 Jews have been allowed to emigrate so far this year and more than 8,000 left in 1987. Those figures are much higher than they were in previous years but far below the peak year of Jewish emigration of more than 51,000 in 1979. About 40 peace activists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for his role in completing the superpower treaty banning medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> exchanged instruments of ratification for that treaty Wednesday. `` He's the statesman we've been waiting for,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who gave <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a small toy from her granddaughter to give to his granddaughter <PERSON> Oxana </PERSON>. The 57-year-old general secretary laughed and chatted like an American politician on the stump with others who walked up to the wooden dias where he sat to present him with a solar-powered watch, an American Indian peace pipe, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears football team sweatshirt and other gifts. With <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were two key advisers, Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader said that in his four summit meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` the content of what we have achieved is immense,'' but that more progress could have been made. He criticized once more <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars program for a space-based shield against nuclear attack. `` We should drag the Americans away from the realm of military space to peaceful space,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The two sides made little progress on that issue during the summit and it remains one of the main obstacles to an agreement to cut long-range nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent. Among the human rights problems the Soviets say exist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the situation of American Indians. At the request of <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION>, an American Indian present at the meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> autographed a copy of his book `` Perestroika'' for former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON> was convicted in 1977 of murdering two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and is jailed at Leavenworth Prison in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON> insists he is innocent, and Soviet media cite his case as an example of what they say are human rights abuses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, answering a question from a Soviet student, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have made a mistake when it `` humored'' Indians by giving them reservations instead of integrating them into society. Indian representative <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday were `` typical of American racism.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the peace activists that each society must be able to choose its own course, without outside interference. He said long experience of Russians and other Soviets with Christianity is proof that they can understand themselves and their society without advice from others.

 Four zoo workers have become moms to a marmoset abandoned by her real mother, and thanks to their tender loving care, little <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> seems to be thriving. The 2-ounce, 6-week-old pygmy marmoset with the 4-inch tail was dropped by her mother when she was just 3 days old. With two other offspring to care for, the mother <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> did n't retrieve her thumb-sized baby But the keepers at <ORGANIZATION> Folsom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>'s Zoo rescued <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> and placed her in an infant isolette to increase the tiny monkey's chances of survival Nightly, one of the four surrogate parents lugs home the 50-pound isolette and caters to <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON>'s hunger every two hours with a specially mixed baby formula dripped through a syringe. Zoo director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapo </PERSON> says he expects <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> will be reunited with her family in a few weeks. The father, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, and mom <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> have been in isolation and out of public view since mid-March during the pregnancy and infancy of the three offspring, <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> and two yet unnamed babies. Last year the pygmy pair gave birth to triplets, but all three died, <PERSON> Chapo </PERSON> said. This time the zoo did n't want to take any chances. Since only about 90 pygmy marmosets were in captivity around the world at the end of last year, according to the international species inventory system, <PERSON> Chapo </PERSON> said he wanted to make sure all three monkeys survived.

The council tried to settle the dispute in January by conducting a hearing to air the gripes. Council members donned plastic pig snouts for the raucous gathering, and one woman even cradled a piglet. But the mediation failed when the council's attorney said the councilors were powerless because the sculpture already had been properly approved.

<HEAD>Airline Unions Claim Drug Testing Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed mandatory drug-testing program for airline workers prompted sharp criticism Thursday from airline labor unions, which argued there is no evidence of a problem in the industry to warrant it. The union officials were among witnesses who testified at a public hearing on a proposed <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regulation that would require a broad range of drug tests, including random screening of tens of thousands of pilots, flight attendants and other airline employees. Representatives of airline management backed the regulations, as did administration officials. The drug-testing program `` is crucial in our effort to establish a drug-free aviation system,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>, who conducted the hearing with <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>. The proposed regulations call for pre-employment tests, post-accident tests, tests if drug use is suspected and a system of random tests of employees. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> have repeatedly called for a drug-testing program in aviation and last year began random testing of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees in a variety of safety-related jobs, including air traffic controllers. `` We are concerned ... that -LRB- the department -RRB- may ahve already decided on the main elements of this proposal'' especially random testing, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolfolk </PERSON>, representing the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said the union is `` uncompromisingly opposed to random drug testing of pilots'' because no evidence has been shown that such tests are needed or that they will be able to identify the small number _ if any _ of drug users in the industry. `` To locate that one pilot, many thousands of tests would have to be given,'' <PERSON> Woolfolk </PERSON> said. `` ... Instead of eliminating drug abuse, -LRB- the mandatory testing -RRB- will merely spawn resentment, opposition and litigation.'' Capt. C.R. Paty of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, complained that commercial aviators are being singled out while private pilots, in whom more of a drug problem has been documented, are not subject to the testing. `` Regulations are proposed to monitor our conduct, while pilots in the general aviation sector whose statistics reveal some measure of drug abuse, are left unregulated,'' <PERSON> Paty </PERSON> said in a written statement. Representatives of flight attendants unions also opposed the rule, as did groups representing private pilots and air taxi operators. Society's drug problem `` should be dealt with by reasonable, not intrusive means. Targeting specific, highly visible groups without cause is not reasonable,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreau </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>. The pilot and flight attendant groups suggested that instead of mandatory random testing, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> help the industry develop a voluntary detection and rehabilitation program for drug abuse similar to the program the industry for years has used to deal with alcoholism. But the drug-testing regulation received the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group for the major airlines. `` We support, as we have from the beginning, the goals of the proposed -LRB- testing -RRB- rule. ... The justification clearly must be the protection of public safety.'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, the trade association's general counsel. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold further hearings on the drug-testing rule in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on June 7 and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on June 9. A final rule is likely before the end of the year.

 The return of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> to power in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> would n't mean a repeat of the tumultuous, pro-Cuba policies that marked his leadership in the 1970s, the Socialist opposition leader said during a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> visit. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, 63, will lead his <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in elections this year against the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, an ally of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who has rebuilt the economy around trade and tourism. Polls by Jamaican sociologist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, who has accurately predicted all island elections for 12 years, have consistently given <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> a solid lead over <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, whose no-nonsense style has overshadowed his economic recovery program. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> in 1980 with the economy deteriorated and tensions high over the heavy involvement of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and radicals in the <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> government. But <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, calling himself more mature and wiser after years of analyzing his government's failings, has met in recent years with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and Jamaican and international business leaders to outline his plans for a new approach. `` I think that what happened then was that a situation was allowed to escalate that should never have happened,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. `` We're quite clear we would have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as part of the Third World, part of the hemisphere, part of the region, etc. But we do not ever intend again to allow the relationship with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to become internally divisive or a source of trouble with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We've had many discussions about this with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and I do n't anticipate it's going to be a problem,'' said <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who blamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic hostility and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> activity for undermining his government in his 1982 book: `` <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>: Struggle In The Periphery.'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> broke relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` The main problem where <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was concerned was that as our relationship developed and the pressure was put on us, we allowed ourselves to become irritated and to become defiant,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said. Asked what <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> can offer his nation, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> replied: `` Nothing in any direct sense. Their model of economic development is a Marxist-Leninist model, and we're firmly rooted in parliamentary democracy, human rights, rule of law and the private sector. These are so vastly different it's hard to consider what one can contribute to the other.'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> supporters warn that <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s rhetoric covers up his continued dedication to leftist principles and the influence of radicals within his party. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, though, pointed to increased business investment in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> in the past year although `` it is almost universally conceded that, short of a miracle, we will form the government.'' That, he said, shows the private sector is confident about his commitment to working with it, an area he concedes he handled poorly during his last government. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said his economic plan would promote national self-reliance while `` shifting away from heavy taxation of the productive side of the economy into the consumptive side; heavy emphasis on creating new businesses, far more collaborative nature between private sector and, importantly, revitalization of <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> Community, a regional common market of the former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>. Elections are expected any time between July and November. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> have made progress in `` peace talks'' aimed at avoiding a repeat of the violence that left hundreds dead in the 1980 election campaign.

<HEAD>House Vote Sends Bill to Senate for Final Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House today overwhelmingly approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a catastrophic health insurance bill designed to protect <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries from the financial devastation of a prolonged, acute illness. The bill, the most sweeping expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> in its 23-year history, includes the program's first-ever outpatient prescription drug benefit. Approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is likely after its Memorial Day recess. Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> has said he will recommend that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sign the legislation despite earlier administration misgivings that the bill is too broad. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted for the bill 328-72. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the plan `` a good, reasonable and responsible agreement'' and said he expected approval by the president Under the legislation, the out-of-pocket deductible for doctor bills covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ the amount paid by each recipient before government aid takes over all costs _ will wind up somewhere between $ 1,320 a year and $ 1,400. The hospital benefit is already set: full, 365 day-a-year coverage after a one-day deductible that rises along with average hospital costs. The 1988 deductible is $ 540. Once fully implemented in 1993, the new prescription drug benefit will pay 80 percent of those costs after a $ 655 deductible. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays no more than 80 percent of doctor bills no matter how high they climb and only 60 days of full hospital coverage after a one-day deductible. The only prescription drugs now covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> are a handful of particularly expensive ones such as anti-rejection medication for organ transplant patients. All of the additional benefits are to be paid for by additional charges to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees. The charges will be a blend of flat monthly premium increases deducted from Social Security checks and an additional, sliding - scale supplemental premium charged the estimated 40 percent of the elderly to be subject to federal income taxes The additional flat premium will start at about $ 4 a month in 1989, climbing to $ 10.20 in 1993. The so-called supplemental premium, tantamount to an income tax surcharge, is expected to total an additional $ 22 a year for each $ 150 of income tax owed in 1989, climbing to an additional $ 42 a year on each $ 150 of tax liability by 1993.

 Sinhalese extremists killed a policeman and wounded nine people in attacks on polling booths Thursday in an unsuccessful effort to block local elections, police said. Elections Commissioner <PERSON> Chandrananda </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said that despite the violence, about half of the 3.6 million eligible voters cast ballots in two District Council elections in western and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Final results for the 158 seats were expected Friday. Opposition politicans charged voting irregularities, and <PERSON> Chandrananda </PERSON> said the complaints were being investigated. The violence was blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of nationalist extremists among the majority Sinhalese that threatened to kill candidates and voters. The front opposes concessions to minority Tamils fighting for autonomy on the island nation. Police said the extremists killed a policeman and injured six other lawmen in two attacks on an election site in the village of <LOCATION> Matugama </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. A bomb exploded in a polling station in the town of <LOCATION> Nuwara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eliya </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, wounding two voters and an election official, said the police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials said armed members of the front also tied up two policemen and took their rifles at a polling station at <LOCATION> Dullewa </LOCATION>, 60 miles northeast of the capital. The rebels burned paper ballots but did not harm them, the officials said. The Sinhalese front also was blamed for attacks Wednesday in which one policeman and an air force member were killed and more than 15 government buildings were razed. Two Sinhalese extremists also were killed Wednesday in a shootout with police. The violence occurred despite the deployment of an estimated 15,000 police and other security forces in the two districts. An Indian-sponsored peace accord called for the creation of the councils. The accord, signed July 29, called for the minority Tamils to end their five-year insurgency in exchange for more say in government. The Sinhalese front, outlawed after a failed 1971 coup, contends that the pact makes too many concessions to the Tamils and has vowed to block it. It has been blamed for killing more than 300 people since July. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and compose 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population, claim they are discriminated against by the island's majority Sinhalese Buddhists. A Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 soldiers to the island to quell the Tamil rebellion. Four district councils were elected April 28. Another council will be selected next week in the south. Elections in the north and east have been delayed indefinitely because of the continuing Tamil insurgency.

<TEXT>
 Fallen television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, just finished with a whirlwind visit to his old <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry stomping grounds, may want to buy back the <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> retreat he left last year, his attorney said Thursday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, spent two days visiting the television ministry they left a year ago amid a sex scandal, then drove Wednesday to a house they used here. `` Probably the first thing they did was dust off the books. They've been gone nine months,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>, an attorney with offices in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, S.C. He said he did not know how long the Bakkers would stay or what exactly they would do. `` There are some meetings we've got to have sometime soon in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB-, so they'll be there for that,'' <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> got a warm reception from some longtime supporters Tuesday and Wednesday when he visited the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, about 150 miles east of here. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who wants to begin a new television ministry, said he's looking for a secluded house in the region, wants to open an office near <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and may ask for air time on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has several times in the past said that he and his wife should have a chance to salvage the ministry, but <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials have always ruled it out. The ministry is up to $ 130 million in debt, and a reorganization plan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approval in Bankruptcy Court. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told reporters he might try to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets when they are liquidated, but refused to say where he would get the money <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION> house, which has a 12-foot stone and wrought-iron security wall and a swimming pool, still belongs to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> creditor <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, contractor. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> bought the house in 1987 and later deeded it to <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, `` But I think eventually they'll want to buy it back,'' the attorney said. Meanwhile, a recently formed investment group that is seeking <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets said it has abandoned efforts to secure a $ 25 million letter of credit. <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of real-estate developers, mortgage bankers, political strategists and a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting executive, is instead seeking partners to raise cash, said company spokesman <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after charges that <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter His departure was followed by revelations about a lavish lifestyle, and he was defrocked by the Assemblies of God.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 States should begin to require reporting of HIV-positive antibody tests and should pass this information on to the Centers for Disease Control, without patient names. Terminology must be selected and used carefully to make the public more aware of the entire spectrum of HIV infection, from initial infection to seroconversion to full-blown AIDS. Extensive research should be conducted and results widely disseminated to provide more accurate information on the spread of HIV into the heterosexual population. Additional data on the progression rates from infection to disease to death are necessary.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PATIENT CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Physicians should begin to more frequently utilize the HIV antibody test as a diagnostic tool, and incorporate the test and counseling into the normal range of services offered to patients. Funds should be made directly available to community-based organizations serving the needs of home-bound persons with AIDS, especially in the area of nutrition, psychosocial and direct care support.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Health care profession schools should be given incentives to recruit medical students into specialties that are underrepresented but needed due to the HIV epidemic. The Department of Labor should move expeditiously, within one year, to develop a permanent and enforceable standard covering blood-borne diseases, with penalties for noncompliance, to protect health care and other workers whose jobs involve exposure to blood and blood-contaminated bodily fluids.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RESEARCH, FDA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Make the development of appropriate animal models for HIV-related research an immediate and high priority. Establish a federally supported computerized network of all HIV-related research activities to promote greater exchange of information and data between researchers. All approaches to vaccine development should continue to be explored and developed until one or more are successful. Standards for condom safety should be increased and studies should be conducted to determine the effects of spermicides, solvents and other lubricants on latex. Studies to determine the shelf life of latex condoms, with or without lubricants or spermicides, should be performed, and packaging dated accordingly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PREVENTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 States should adopt strong statutes that protect the confidentiality of a person's test results and that protect a person from discriminatory retaliation. All state and local health agencies should be adequately funded to develop HIV partner notification programs without diverting resources from other sexually transmitted disease partner notification programs. Quarantine or isolation of HIV-infected individuals based only on HIV status without consideration of an individual's behavior is not appropriate and should not be adopted by any state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Centers for Disease Control should conduct a 90-day study on the effectiveness of purchasing paid advertising, in addition to requesting advertising at no cost, to prevent misinformation about the HIV epidemic going to the general public. State boards of education should mandate that an AIDS education curriculum with appropriate content for age be offered to all students at each schooling level -LRB- e.g., elementary, middle and high school -RRB- throughout the state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIETAL ISSUES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, in conjunction with state agencies, local drug abuse officials and representatives of drug treatment providers, should develop a plan for increasing the capacity of the drug treatment system so that the goal of treatment-on-demand can be met.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE WORKPLACE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Public and private employers should ensure that their workplace policies provide HIV-infected employees with the same rights and benefits offered other employees with other illnesses and disabilities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LEGAL AND ETHICAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Comprehensive federal anti-discrimination legislation which prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the public and private sectors, including employment, housing, public accommodations and participation in government programs, should be enacted. Each school system should establish a board-developed policy, with accompanying guidelines, for dealing with an individual with HIV infection in the school before it is confronted with the first case. The commission recommends ... adoption of federal legislation that mandates that identifying information obtained by any provider, laboratory, payor or agency through HIV testing and counseling can not be disclosed without the written consent of the individual -LRB- except under certain specific circumstances. -RRB-
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE FUTURE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should enact legislation which expands the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergencies </ORGANIZATION> provision of the Public Health Services Act to enhance the authority of the surgeon general when the president determines and declares public health emergencies in the nation. The surgeon general should sit as the principal spokesperson on the president's cabinet whenever issues related to the public health emergency are discussed. The surgeon general's office should be established as an independent entity within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Drought has clamped down hard on <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> farmers, threatening crops such as peanuts, soybeans and corn, state officials said Thursday. `` This has got to be treated as a major drought, on a a par with the'50s, the'30s,'' and three other major droughts dating back to the 1840s, state climatologist <PERSON> Gayther </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> said Thursday. `` All crops and pastures are in a stressful situation. If rain does n't come soon, there's a chance we'll be losing the crops,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Midden </PERSON>, agricultural statistician for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. One after another, governments around <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have tightened restrictions on outdoor water use, to conserve the dwindling supply in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanier </LOCATION>, the area's primary water resource. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area is 5.4 inches, or 23 percent, short on water for the year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The northeastern part of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is running 50 percent of normal rainfall or slightly less in some places'' for the first five months of 1988, said <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> in a telephone interview from his office at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. The southern half of the state `` is adequate to short'' on rainfall, <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Midden </PERSON> said the latest crop report shows 30 percent of the state has adequate soil moisture, 52 percent is short and 18 percent is very short. Row crops, such as peanuts, soybeans and corn, are in serious trouble, <PERSON> Midden </PERSON> said. Lack of moisture causes slow germination and poor stands. `` They're sitting in the dry soil and withering away.'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is the nation's largest peanut producing state, and its 1987 crop was valued at $ 500 million. Tobacco is transplanted early and by now has developed a full root system, making it more tolerant of the drought, he said. The peach and winter wheat harvests already are under way. Because of dry pastures, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> has gotten permission for farmers to graze livestock on land set aside under the Conservation Reserve Program of the Food Security Act of 1985. Normally, that land must lie fallow. `` This additional pasture and hay should give our farmers some needed relief,'' <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> said Wednesday. Without additional feed, he said, `` farmers could be forced to sell off their herds, leading to a shortage of feeder cows later in the year.'' <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> said the Southeast goes through a five-year `` W-shaped drought cycle'' every 25 to 30 years. It's a dry period, followed by a short wet period, then another dry period, with gradually increasing rainfall, he said. The left-hand bottom of the current `` W'' was in 1986. `` Our current drought is not yet as intense as the'54 drought,'' he said. `` The drought is not as deep as the'54, but we are broader than the'54. The ` W' has a broader bottom to it. We are into this thing a little longer than we have been on the five previous occasions.'' He said he expected a wetter period to recur in the early 1990s. <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs, on Wednesday became the latest to tighten water use restrictions, banning outdoor water use between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and from midnight Fridays through midnight Sundays. `` The water consumption was going up instead of going down,'' said <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, deputy director of the water and sewer division. `` We have to do something to slow down water consumption.''

<BYLINE>Party Official Calls For Publication of Khrushchev Speech on Stalin

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member on Thursday called for the publication of a `` secret speech'' <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> gave in 1956 that detailed dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes against society. `` If the party is keeping secrets from Communists in the pages of its history that are not state secrets, then it is clear that it does n't serve the unity of the party,'' said <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON>, dean of the Philosophy and <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Sverdlovsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The article by <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON>, a teacher of Marxism-Leninism, was published in Thursday's editions of the Sovietskaya Kultura newspaper. It appeared to be the latest example in the leadership's campaign to open up the pages of Soviet history and break down the barriers erected by those who are clinging to the old policy of guarding and controlling all information <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s address to the 20th Party Congress, held three years after the death of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1953, described the dictator's crimes in the 29 years he served as Soviet leader. About 20 million Soviets were killed in political purges carried out under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and in the drive to collectivize agriculture, according to estimates by Western historians. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes are no longer a taboo subject The name of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who was ousted as leader in 1964, is appearing more frequently in the press. The call by <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON> to publish <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s denunciation of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is not the first. In October, prominent Soviet scientist <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldansky </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s report, known in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as his `` secret speech'' because it was delivered behind closed doors, should be published. The withholding of the information from Soviets was `` ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON> said, since the text of the speech was leaked almost immediately in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` All the world a long time ago read the ` secret' report by N.S. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> at the 20th Party Congress of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB-, but an overwhelming majority of Soviet Communists do n't know this document, which so radically changed the evaluation of the development of the party and the state,'' the educator wrote. He said the whole nation, not just party members, awaits the publication of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s report, as well as the documents of all party congresses, conferences and plenums. <PERSON> Rusakov </PERSON> said that was necessary for historical research, which he said was a part of glasnost. He said the documents should also be put before the public to overcome `` the stereotypes and myths which were created and indoctrinated into the consciousness of the people.'' He called for an accounting of how people were politically repressed and who was responsible. `` This is the sole means to avoid the gossip, rumors and ill-intended falsification of the internal life and history of the party,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dies for Gold Coins Missing, Mint Admits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dies used to strike the most valuable coin minted by the government are missing, a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official acknowledged Thursday. The Secret Service is investigating the disappearance in January of 24 dies for the obverse, or front, of 1-ounce gold bullion Eagles, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint. They were lost or stolen while en route between mints in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, he said. The Eagle has a face value of $ 50 but the sales price, currently $ 460 to $ 470, fluctuates with the price of spot gold. The dies, which are 5-inch-long cylinders the width of a coin, are worth about $ 40 each, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He said the missing dies likely would be of little use to counterfeiters because all were for one side of the coin. But Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the Mint, branded the loss _ the second such mishap in two years _ `` unpardonable. In the first incident, 44 dies used to strike the $ 1 <ORGANIZATION> Statue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> commemorative coins disappeared in April 1986 on their way to the Royal Canadian Mint in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Only one was ever recovered. It turned up last year in the possession of a Canadian coin dealer at a coin show in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. After the 1986 incident, the Mint began hiring armored cars for cross-border shipments but continued to use overnight mail services for delivery within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Normally employees of the delivery service sign for the dies at each transfer point, but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said a clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mint </ORGANIZATION> apparently failed to complete a shipping form requiring that. `` They were shipped as ordinary freight, as if they were a crate of oranges,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said in a recent speech on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` Someone apparently figured out that a package going from one mint to another mint would be valuable.'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said he would grill Mint officials on the subject at budget hearings conducted by his subcommittee later this year. `` I intend to find out why security for dies was so deliberately lax,'' he said. `` Losing dies once because of slack shipping procedures is inexcusable; losing dies a second time is unpardonable.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said about 75,000 dies are shipped around the country each year. They are made in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and sent to regional mints, depending on production schedules. Dies used to mint `` proof'' coins for collectors are sent to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for a special polishing process. Beginning in late April, the Mint began using armored cars for domestic, as well as cross-border shipments, he said. `` I think our record's pretty good. ... Obviously it was a mistake and we do n't like them to happen and we moved quickly to make sure it does n't happen again,'' he said. The clerk has not been disciplined, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, but `` We're working on that process right now. However, <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> noted that the change in shipping procedures came three months after the Eagle dies disappeared. `` The Mint's foot-dragging on switching to a secure method of shipping dies is inexplicable,'' he said in the floor speech, delivered May 25 and first reported in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post. `` Was the Mint trying to pinch pennies? ... Quite frankly I do not have the answers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Engineers And University Employees Stage 24-Hour Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 130,000 engineers, technicians and university employees staged a 24-hour warning strike Thursday, disrupting work at military industries, delaying flights and slowing down work at government offices. The three unions called the strike to press wage demands in stalled contract negotiations. A <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> labor court ordered the workers back to work, and union leaders said they would comply at the end of the job action scheduled for midnight Thursday. President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> said the strikers were `` fighting professional struggles on the public's back, on the back of the citizens.'' `` I rise up against this norm, which has become entrenched in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, the only radio station operating Thursday. The strikers also shut down the government-run television station. The <ORGANIZATION> Bezek </ORGANIZATION> telephone company did not make repairs, and the electric company operated on a reduced weekend schedule, according to the radio report. The strike virtually paralyzed the government-run aviation industry, military factories, high technology industries and some plants owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s trade union federation, the radio said. At <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, some disruptions, including flight delays, were reported. `` The automatic luggage distributor has failed, and of course the technicians are not repairing it,'' union leader <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-David </PERSON> told the radio. At <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, about 500 engineers and administration officials did not show up for work, shutting down laboratories and computers, said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barach </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, reported a similar situation. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Raz </PERSON>, head of the technicians union, said the strike was a warning to the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to renew stalled wage negotiations. Finance Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON>, who has maintained strict price and wage controls to keep <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s high inflation in check, responded by saying the strike did not damage to the economy. `` This is a one-day strike that was forced on the workers by the professional unions, and I heard that many workers were dissatisfied -LRB- with the strike call -RRB-,'' he said. The strike came just after negotiations passed a major hurdle, when unions agreed to end the linkage between wages and economic indicators, said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>. Such linkages in the past have been blamed as contributing to high inflation rates. The unions represent workers in variety of workplaces and salary levels. They have not stated specific figures, but they want raises of at least 10 percent. Monthly salaries now range from $ 435 to $ 1,850. The government maintains the economy now is stable so even small raises are unnecessary. Inflation last year was 20 percent, which is low by Israeli standards.

<HEAD>Shultz Briefs NATO, Allies Cheer Better East-West Relations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies Thursday that the failure to reach a strategic arms agreement at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit was a blessing `` in a curious way'' because it allowed more attention to be focused on human rights and other issues. The allies, in turn, cheered what they called a broad improvement in East-West relations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with European foreign ministers and other alliance officials for about two hours before flying to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to join President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He plans to leave Friday on a new mission to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to push his plan for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks. `` I certainly feel, and I believe all my fellow foreign ministers felt, the outcome was a very good one,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said the two leaders had scored advances in numerous areas of arms control, including negotiations to ban chemical weapons, cut long-range nuclear missiles and reduce East-West conventional forces. <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, the West German foreign minister, told reporters after meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that his government was pleased with the summit results, despite the lack of a big breakthrough in arms control. `` We share his opinion that it was a successful and substantial summit,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. `` Through this summit the American-Soviet relationship got a new stability, a new perspective.'' Other alliance officials were equally upbeat. `` What is important is the judgment that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> gave that the political climate of the meeting was a substantial success,'' Italian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary general, underscored the emphasis <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put on human rights issues during the summit, as well as the progress reported in various areas of arms control. `` All these are elements of an increasingly stable relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which can only benefit the alliance,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said. In his news conference, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> discounted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comment on Wednesday that the summit could have achieved more in arms control. `` Always it's possible to achieve more ... but it simply was n't possible to work through all of the difficult issues, and I think we all recognize that,'' he said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that absent a major arms control breakthrough, the superpowers were able to give more attention to three other main agenda items: human rights, bilateral relations and regional issues such as the Angolan civil war. He called this a blessing `` in a curious way.'' `` The absence of anything like that has caused people to reflect on what may be the more important meaning of what the president, the general secretary and others have managed to put together here,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` People can see more clearly than otherwise that the -LRB- superpower -RRB- relationship now proceeds on the basis of an established, four-part agenda.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declined to rule out a U.S.-Soviet agreement on 30 percent to 50 percent reductions in strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. The main stumbling block is Soviet objections to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative for developing a space-based defense against ballistic missiles. `` It's possible. We're going to work hard on it,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Negotiations are scheduled to resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on July 12. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that the Europeans were particularly eager to see a strategic arms accord, since the Soviet long-range missiles can be targeted on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> territory. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had demonstrated at the summit a determination `` to want to conclude initiatives with this administration to the maximum extent possible.''

Rather they are responding to patience, firmness and solidarity on the part of the allies.'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> was scheduled to brief Chinese leaders on Saturday and planned to go to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for similar meetings.

<TEXT>
 Mr. General Secretary and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. This is an emotional moment for Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and me. We have been truly moved by the warmth and the generous hospitality that we received from all of our Soviet hosts during this brief visit but most especially from the two of you. During this meeting, as in all of our previous meetings, I appreciated and valued our exchanges and the long hours of hard work that we and our experts put in to make progress on the difficult issues we face. But this meeting has added something else for Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and me. Our time here has allowed us to know if only briefly your art treasures and your people, artists, writers, individuals from all walks of life, people who were willing to share with us their experiences, their fears, their hopes. Mr. General Secretary, it is fitting that we are ending our visit as we began it in this hall named for the Order of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>. I would like to think that our efforts during these past few days have slayed a few dragons and advanced the struggle against the evils that threaten mankind, threats to peace and to liberty. And I would like to hope that like <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, with <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s help, peace and freedom can prevail Mr. General Secretary, if you will permit me just one more proverb. I think a very old and popular saying you have here about last Sunday, the day of our arrival, spoke to the promise we have seen fulfilled at this summit in this <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring. Truly then <LOCATION> Troitsa </LOCATION> _ ves les postroitsya -LRB- Holiday of the Trinity _ and the whole forest will bloom -RRB-. And now, if I might just conclude on a personal note. Earlier this week at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> I mentioned to the young people there that they appeared to my eyes exactly as would any group of students in my own country or anywhere else in the world. So, too, did <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I find the faces young and old here on the streets of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. At first, more than anything else, they were curious faces, but as the time went on the smiles began and then the waves. And I do n't have to tell you <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I smiled back and waved just as hard. Mr. General Secretary, I think you understand we're not just grateful to both you and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but want you to know we think of you as friends. And in that spirit, we would ask one further favor of you. Tell the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of the deep feelings of friendship felt by us and by the people of our country toward them. Tell them, too, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are grateful for their coming out to see us, grateful for their waves and smiles and tell them we will remember all of our days, their faces, the faces of hope, hope for a new era in human history, an era of peace between our nations and our peoples. Thank you and God bless you.

<TEXT>
 Esteemed Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, one hour from now you will be leaving <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In the first place, I want to thank you and your colleagues for cooperation, openness and a business-like approach to the talks we have had here. I believe that both of us have every reason to regard this meeting and your visit as a useful contribution to the development of dialogue betwen the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mr President, you and I have been dealing with each other for three years now. From the first exchange of letters to the conclusion of this meeting, we've come a long way. Our dialogue has not been easy but we mustered enough realism and political will to overcome obstacles and divert the train of U.S.-Soviet relations from a dangerous track to a safer one. It has, however, so far been moving much more slowly than is required by the real situation, both in our two countries and in the whole world. But as I have understood, Mr. President, you are willing to continue our joint endeavors. For my part, I can assure you that we will do everything in our power to go on moving forward. Now, with the vast experience of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and backed up by their achievements, we are in duty bound to display still greater determination and consistency. That is what the Soviet and American peoples, international public opinion and the entire world community are expecting of us. I hope you will have pleasant memories of your stay in this country. Mr. President, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when you return to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> please convey to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people best wishes from the peoples of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Over the past three years, our two nations have come to know each other better, they have now taken a really good look in each other's eyes and have a keener sense of the need to learn to live together on this beautiful planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. I wish you a good journey back home, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. To you and to all members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, I wish good health. Good-bye.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government Thursday lost a three-year court battle to block Australian publication of a former intelligence agent's memoirs. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s expensive crusade against <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s `` Spycatcher'' had prompted protests that the government was infringing on freedom of the press <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s highest court, the seven-judge High Court in the capital of <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, ruled against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in its final bid to suppress the book. The judges accepted <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s contention that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was bound by a lifetime oath of silence about his 25 years with the MI5 counterespionage agency, but they said <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> courts had no jurisdiction to enforce a British security regulation. They unanimously rejected the British government's attempt to seize all profits from `` Spycatcher'' to prevent further publication of the book in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. About 240,000 copies of the book had been sold in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after lower courts ruled in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s favor, and publishers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> released 200,000 paperback copies immediately after Thursday's verdict. The judgment also releases nearly $ 3.6 million in royalties to the 73-year-old <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who lives on a horse farm in <LOCATION> Tasmania </LOCATION> and is said to be in poor health. The publicity from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s campaign against the book accounts for much of the book's stunning commercial success. More than 1.4 million copies have been sold in 40 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, despite the government's continued ban in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The British taxpayer is left with an legal bill estimated at $ 3.6 million. In the Australian case alone, the government was ordered to pay an estimated $ 900,000 in legal costs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, frequently smuggled into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by tourists and Britons returning from overseas, describes his 20-year career in the MI5 counterespionage service. It alleges that the security service eavesdropped on foreign embassies, burgled offices, stole documents, plotted assassination attempts and discussed how to bring down <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government in the 1970s. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s attempt to suppress the memoirs dates from September 1985 when an Australian court granted a temporary injunction against the book. The subsequent hearings prompted newspapers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to publish extracts of `` Spycatcher,'' and the government immediately clamped down, creating a confrontation over press freedom. The government maintains it has pursued the case to uphold the principle that former security officers are bound by a lifetime oath of silence about their work. To relax the rule, officials argue, would seriously undermine national security. Lawmaker <PERSON> Tam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalyell </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the government was squandering public money on its legal challenges. `` It was obvious to many lawyers and politicians many moons ago that this -LRB- Australian decision -RRB- would happen,'' <PERSON> Dalyell </PERSON> said. `` It was political obstinacy and stupidity on behalf of the government. ... The government must now abandon all other proceedings relating to this book around the world.'' The government still hopes to block `` Spycatcher'' in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where it has banned the book and brought a half-dozen court cases to prevent newspapers from publishing extracts. On June 13, the nation's highest court, the five-judge Law Lords of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, is to decide whether to overturn a ban imposed on publication of extracts from `` Spycatcher'' in three newspapers, The Sunday Times, The Observer and The Guardian. Conservative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mates </PERSON> said the principle confidentiality on which the government based its case should be defended to the last. `` And I think the government has been entirely right to do that, difficult and embarrassing as it has been,'' he said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs $300 Billion Defense Spending Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted approval Thursday of a $ 300 billion military spending bill that gives President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> far less than he wanted for his `` Star Wars'' anti-missile defense. The voice vote action sends the bill to the floor of the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where it is expected to be considered next week. The bill appropriates $ 299.5 billion for the Pentagon for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which would be a reduction from the current defense budget of $ 301 billion. The bill appropriates $ 3.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.9 billion for the program, which has a $ 3.9 billion budget for the current year. The bill appropriates money already authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month in a separate <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> measure. The appropriations bill did not contain a series of arms control restrictions added last month by Democrats to the authorization bill. Those restrictions eliminate all but the smallest nuclear tests, require adherence to the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear arms treaty and ban spending money for any Star Wars tests that violate the existing interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The restrictions were dropped from the legislation approved Thursday hiefly because of a jurisdictional fight within the House between the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the authorization bill. Under House rules, the appropriation bills are only supposed to involve amounts of money, and not include policy issues such as arms control. The <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had objected to adding the arms control restrictions to the appropriations bill. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a supporter of the restrictions, said, `` I think you might see the arms control amendments added on the floor. `` My instinct is that it helps to have them on both bills, appropriations and the authorization bill,'' said <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>. `` I would support adding them on the floor.'' Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., said, `` We did n't add the arms control provision basically because of a jurisdictional question.

<HEAD>Investigation Shows Credentialing Failure at Bethesda Naval
Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years after its chief heart surgeon was court-martialed, the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> has come under new criticism for failing to follow physician credentialing procedures, officials said Thursday. An internal investigation has concluded the latest problem did not jeopardize patient care, and the competence of any doctors never was called into question at the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> facility, the officials added. But the finding that there was a procedural failure in the hiring and credentialing of a physician at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s premiere hospital nonetheless has `` attracted high-level attention,'' one of the officials said. The criticism is contained in an interim audit report by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general. The report was prompted by a complaint from the current head of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>'s cardio-thoracic unit. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would not release the interim audit report, but several officials agreed to discuss the matter on condition they not be identified. The issue is a particularly sensitive one for <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> because of the case of Dr. <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, the former chief heart surgeon. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> was court-martialed and convicted in 1986 of involuntary manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three patients. That conviction was overturned in April by an appeals court, however, and <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> received an honorable discharge. One of the key issues raised by prosecutors during the court-martial was that <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> hid a visual handicap from his superiors and that military recruiters failed to investigate his background adequately. In the latest case, the sources said the inspector general found the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to adequately review the patient survival record of a heart surgeon who was returning to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> after five years in private practice as the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> cardio-thoracic unit. Ironically, the surgeon involved _ Dr. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peniston </PERSON> _ was a prosecution witness against <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>. The officials said Thursday that <PERSON> Peniston </PERSON>'s credentials were not reviewed formally by a new panel of naval officers before his appointment to the hospital. <PERSON> Peniston </PERSON>'s appointment was finalized in February with orders given to him to report for duty in March. <PERSON> Peniston </PERSON>, who was assigned temporarily to the cardio-thoracic unit at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> early in May, did not return a phone call Thursday to discuss the matter. The inspector general launched the investigation after a complaint was filed by Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, the current head of the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> cardio-thoracic unit.

 Police said Thursday they recovered six paintings by <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON> and arrested eight suspects in a theft two months ago from the <ORGANIZATION> Fundacion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. A painting believed to be the work of 19th century French artist <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Toulouse-Lautrec </PERSON> also was recovered, police chief <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Ferran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenal </PERSON>, civil governor of <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>, returned the Miro paintings to the museum. On Wednesday, police in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, arrested <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrancio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in connection with the April 5 museum break-in. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carrancio </PERSON>, 32, was in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> seeking buyers for the Miro works, which included gouaches, pastels and oils from the Spanish artist's early period. Also on Wednesday, police arrested a 36-year-old Uruguayan, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, 36, and two suspects in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>.

Investigators began following Carrancio and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> the day after the theft, when a witness provided the license number of a van registered to one of them, de <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carrancio </PERSON> set off an alarm when he broke into museum but escaped because the lone, unarmed night watchman called police instead of confronting the thief, police said. <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> allegedly was waiting outside in the van. According to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Federico </PERSON>, both men have police records and are not specialists in art theft.

<TEXT>
 Consumers lack adequate information to evaluate the quality of care from doctors and hospitals, according to a congressional study released Thursday. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, prepared at the request of Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said there now is no single source readily available to the consumer to evaluate the quality of care, and what little information is available is difficult to collect and understand. Such evaluations could be created, the report said, if congress would act to require the data to be collected and released to the public. `` We have all kinds of high-tech medical equipment now, but when it comes to information for consumers on the quality of medical care, we are still in the ice age,'' <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said in releasing the report. `` What information is available is inadquate and frequently incomprehensible.'' <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said he will conduct hearings to determine the best way to evaluate the qualilty of work by doctors and hospitals and then will push for a legislation requiring that this information be distributed to consumers. `` We're trying to develop a system to give consumers information that they need,'' he said. `` We know now that there are valid indicators to assess both hospitals and doctors.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report said quality of care information could be used not only by individual consumers, but also by companies and labor unions that are selecting hospitals, physician groups and health maintenance organizations. Doctors could find the information on other doctors useful in deciding on referrals and in hiring staff physicians at hospitals or HMOs. For now, the report said consumers rely mostly on the suggestions and experiences of friends and families to select doctors and hospitals.

 Fresh from the splendors of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> went to Buckingham Palace for tea with the queen Thursday and smiled aside all invitations to compare the virtues of East and West. Standing on a red carpet in the marble-columned Grand Entrance Hall of the 600-room palace, the president was asked by a reporter whether he was happy to be out of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and back in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Let me put it very simply, I'm very happy to be in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' he replied, smiling wryly. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose prickly relationship with <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was evident during this week's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, was asked whether she was happy to be seeing Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> rather than the Soviet leader's wife. `` I'm very happy to see the queen at all times,'' she replied with a big smile. The hour-long tea in the queen's Audience Room overlooking the 45-acre palace gardens was a meeting of old friends. The Reagans were guests of the royal family at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> in 1982, and the 62-year-old monarch stayed at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ranch in 1983. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attended a Buckingham Palace dinner during the 1984 economic summit. The Reagans arrived at the palace two minutes late, getting out of their limousine at the glassed-in Grand Entrance, where Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> returned in a horse-drawn open carriage after their 1981 wedding extravaganza. Inside the hall, the queen, hatless and wearing a sapphire-blue silk dress, stretched out her hand and said: `` Nice to see you again. How are you Mr. President?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a blue suit and red and blue striped tie, and the first lady, wearing a silk two-piece dress and matching shoes in her favorite color of red, chatted with the queen while posing for photographers. Then, the queen led them along the gilt-and-white Marble Hall, lined with sculptures and paintings mainly of her great-great grandmother <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, to the Audience Room, where she receives Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for her weekly audience. It was just tea for three, since the queen's husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, had a previous engagement in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>. The Reagans' greeting was watched by about 50 members of the queen's household who stood behind a red rope in the Marble Hall. Outside the palace, police said about 1,500 people gathered, cheering and waving as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> drove by. The president and his wife waved back as they swept through the iron gates. `` We got a beautiful warm smile. It was worth the 2 -LCB- - hour wait,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said: `` I live ... about 30 miles from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch, and I do n't bother to visit him, and here I am half way around the world standing in line waiting to get a vague glimpse of him.'' <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was enthusiastic about the American president. `` I think he's a good bloke,'' she said. After tea, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> went their separate ways. The president went to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> where he was officially welcomed by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and a band of Welsh Guards playing the national anthem and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> hits. The first lady returned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence, <ORGANIZATION> Winfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to meet with <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who flew back to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from a series of public engagements in <LOCATION> Lancashire </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the 39-year-old heir to the throne have met several times previously in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and the palace said they share an interest in social and human rights issues.

 The remains of the bunker where <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> committed suicide were destroyed to make room for a housing project in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the state-run East German news agency reported Thursday. `` For the new building project, the former bunker site was cleared over the past few months with numerous blastings and with wreckage collection teams,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency report said. During World War II, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and other Nazi officials often used bunker complexes in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, then the capital of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to direct the war and seek protection for Allied bomb attacks. To avoid capture when the war ended, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and his companion <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> killed themselves in the chancellory bunker, which was on what now is part of the construction site in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In recent years, the site next to the Berlin Wall was only a pile of rubble that had become overgrown with grass and weeds. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said apartments for about 3,000 people will be constructed there. It said a shopping center, school and kindergarten also will be constructed as part of the project.

<HEAD>Study Says U.S. Living Standard Rises Slower Than in Other
Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The standard of living of workers in other major countries has risen four times as fast as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standard of living in the past 15 years, according to a new study on American competitiveness released Thursday. The report, prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competitiveness </ORGANIZATION>, concluded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had lost ground not only in terms of living standards, but also in the related areas of international trade, productivity and investment. `` In an increasingly global economy, others are either fast gaining on us or have surpassed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the areas that will determine future competitive success,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economics professor who served as a consultant on the study. `` If we continue along the path we've been on since 1972, we could lose the competitiveness battle altogether.'' The council is a coalition of executives from industry, organized labor and higher education who got together in 1986 to help American companies compete more effectively in world markets. The new report is certain to heighten the debate in the presidential campaign over whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is becoming a second-rate economic power. Critics of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies point to the country's status as the world's largest debtor nation to highlight their contention that a string of record trade deficits during the 1980s shows that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost the ability to compete internationally. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has dismissed such concerns, contending that the country's trade deficits have begun to improve and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is currently enjoying the longest peacetime expansion on record. But the council's report argued that the administration's position neglects long-term economic trends that paint a more distressing picture `` We would hope that both presidential candidates will have strong programs to propose in this area,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` This will give the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> people a benchmark with which to grade the quality of each candidate's proposals.'' The council presented what it called a `` competitiveness index,'' which it said measured <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s performance against its competitors in global markets. The report said in all four areas it surveyed, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had lost ground compared with the world's six other large industrial democracies _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. These nations and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meet annually for economic summits, including an upcoming session this month in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Among the report's conclusions: _ Since 1972, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> standard of living has grown only one-fourth as fast as the average standard of living of the other summit countries When compared with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s two biggest competitors, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the difference is even more striking. American workers' standard of living has risen only one-half as fast as the average West German and only one-seventh as fast as the average Japanese. Because of these developments, the council's standard of living index dropped to 78.9, which is 21.1 points below its 1972 level of 100. Traditional measures of the standard of living focus on total output divided by the population. However, the council said it divided output by the number of workers to reflect the fact that more and more American families find they must have two incomes to keep up financially. The council's living standard also included the country's trade deficit on the grounds that this represented money borrowed from foreigners that would eventually have to be paid back. _ Despite the boom in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> export sales last year, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s share of world exports stood at 10 percent last year, below the 12 percent share the country had in This pushed the trade index down to 82.6 percent of its 1972 base. This was still an improvement from 1986, when the index fell to 74.5, before the weaker dollar began to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales. _ Productivity, the output per worker, showed the most lost ground The council's measure for productivity dropped to 68.7 percent of its 1972 base. Since 1972, manufacturing productivity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has increased eight times faster than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while average productivity growth in the six summit countries has been more than four times as fast as in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. _ Long-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment, including spending for research and development, capital equipment and education, came out best in the ranking at 96.2, down only 3.8 percent from the 1972 level

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cut short his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign Thursday and canceled his final debate with rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> who faced back surgery Friday morning. `` She feels good; she's obviously a little apprehensive,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after talking with his wife by telephone before leaving <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' surgery was decided upon after her doctor in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON>, examined results of tests done last Saturday while she was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. She was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night for further tests, and hospital spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bander </PERSON> said she was experiencing `` considerable increasing discomfort.'' `` Because of the worsening of the condition, we feel it important to operate now,'' <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had complained for about a month of a numbness in her hands and pain in her neck, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, campaign press secretary for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The surgery is to correct two herniated cervical discs in the neck area of her back, <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said. He said no other medical problem was discovered. `` I think everything is OK and is going to be OK, but Dr. <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON> felt it was better to operate now and not wait a few days,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporter. <PERSON> Bander </PERSON>, the hospital spokesman, said the operation involved taking a bone graft from Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hip to replace a portion of bone in her back that is pressing against her spinal cord. `` The plan is to remove the discs compressing on the spinal cord. The bone graft taken from the hip will be split and fused into the vertabrae to replace the two areas from which the discs will be removed,'' <PERSON> Bander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he regretted having to cancel campaign appearances but `` this is obviously the most important thing.'' He said he hoped to resume campaigning Saturday or Sunday `` if everything is OK.'' His debate with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was to have been the last debate by the Democratic presidential candidates of the primary season Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were campaigning toward the June 7 primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm available to debate any time.'' He said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` His excuse is certainly an acceptable one. ... I do fervently hope the debate can be rescheduled.'' Among the other campaign events canceled was a scheduled stop in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and a meeting with supporters in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' surgery was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EDT at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, with a surgical team led by <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON>, chief of neurosurgery at the hospital. <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said doctors described her medical problem as `` a degenerative condition'' apparently not caused by an injury. She has been wearing a neck brace. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> only Wednesday night. He attended just one public event, a meeting with school children on a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> beach, before leaving. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> first met privately with environmentalists at a restaurant, the <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, overlooking the rocky <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast where seals played in the ocean. He then walked down to a beach where he spoke informally to 45 elementary school pupils about the environment and the importance of using biodegradable products that will not leave lasting pollution. On another subject, at a news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the summit meeting just concluded in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` was n't dramatic'' but produced `` a series of small steps that are encouraging.'' `` Obviously there's some disappointment there's not a START -LRB- strategic arms reduction -RRB- agreement, but that does n't mean we ca n't have one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Researchers Find AIDS Virus' Precise Target on White Blood Cells</HEAD>

 Scientists have identified the precise target where the AIDS virus latches onto cells it destroys, another step toward a drug to combat the fatal disease. `` For the first time, we have fairly precisely defined the structure on the cell surface to which a virus binds. This is a primary step in the infective process,'' said protein chemist <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, research team leader at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Once the virus' target, called a `` binding site,'' was identified by <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> molecular biologist <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, the study's chief author, he and his colleagues manufactured crude synthetic copies of the binding site. The study's co-authors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> then found that in the test tube, the fake binding sites acted as decoys to attract the AIDS virus. They overwhelmed AIDS virus particles so the virus could n't latch onto real binding sites on T4 white blood cells, the main cells infected and destroyed by the virus, which cripples the immune system. If scientists can create more sophisticated versions of the fake binding site, those might work as a drug to treat or cure acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or to carry virus-killing drugs to the AIDS virus. The same method might be used to create drugs to fight other viruses, rheumatoid arthritis and rejection of transplanted organs, <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> said. `` This is the first step toward a second-generation drug'' that could be available in 10 years and be more effective than drugs now under development to combat the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said, adding, `` We do not want to give people false hope.'' `` Kent is exaggerating the length of time a little bit,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mathilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Krim </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research. `` If things go very well, I'd say two years until it -LRB- the drug -RRB- would be made available to people with life-threatening HIV -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- infection.'' <PERSON> Krim </PERSON>'s foundation funded the $ 120,000 study, which is being published Friday in the journal Science. Other co-authors included <ORGANIZATION> ORTHO </ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals researchers in <LOCATION> Raritan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Scientists previously knew the AIDS virus infects T4 white blood cells by binding to CD4, a protein on their surface. <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> researchers identified the exact part of that protein to which the AIDS virus binds, and determined that it looks like a loop protruding from the protein. `` To my knowledge, it is the first time a binding site has been identified with such precision for any virus,'' <PERSON> Krim </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's a wonderful accomplishment.'' `` It will enable people to get a handle on the mechanism by which a virus can infect a cell,'' <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> said. In December, researchers at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said they manufactured synthetic CD4 proteins In test-tube experiments, the fake proteins acted as decoys, preventing the AIDS virus from infecting T4 cells. The fake binding site copies made by <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> biology chairman <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> stopped AIDS infection the same way. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> speculated that a drug made only of fake binding sites, rather than fake whole CD4 proteins, should last longer in the bloodstream and be more effective in stopping AIDS. A major obstacle is that either fake CD4 proteins or fake binding sites might serve not only as decoys for the AIDS virus, but as decoys for macrophages, cells that carry invading germs to T4 cells so they can be destroyed by the immune system. So a drug meant to prevent AIDS from destroying the immune system might actually prevent the immune system from performing its job, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Krim </PERSON> said that risk should be much lower if fake binding sites rather than fake CD4 proteins are used in a drug, and that such risk would be acceptable in treating severely ill AIDS patients. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said drugs could be developed against other viruses if scientists identify precisely binding sites on cells those viruses attack, then make fake binding sites to prevent the viruses from reaching their intended targets. Such drugs might be useful even if they harm the immune system. Those drugs might be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other `` autoimmune'' diseases _ in which the body is attacked by its own immune system _ and to prevent the immune system from rejecting transplanted organs, <PERSON> Krim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Soviet Plant Apparently Discharging Radioactive Clouds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swedish monitors said Thursday they have detected radiation indicating that a nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> routinely discharges clouds of radioactive particles. `` The levels are still harmless, but they illustrate a poorer security thinking than we have in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lars-Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON> of the defense research agency FOA. He said a study of wind directions and radiation levels at different monitoring stations pointed to the <LOCATION> Ignalina </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> as the source of the radiation. He said the plant 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> has made four large discharges of radioactive particles every year since it started operations at the end of 1983. Each discharge from <LOCATION> Ignalina </LOCATION> contains 10,000 times more radioactive material than a Swedish nuclear plant discharges over an entire year, he said. `` The guideline in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is to discharge as little as possible,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We pointed it out to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear authorities in 1986, but they denied such discharges were made at Ignalina.'' <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has been on higher alert against radioactivity since the 1986 accident at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> plant, 720 miles southeast of here, sent clouds of contamination over vast areas of northern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The world's worst nuclear accident killed at least 31 people near the plant.

<HEAD>Gannett Chairman Says Castro, Botha Mistreated By U.S. Reporters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that world leaders such as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> have been mistreated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters whom many heads of state now view as the new ugly Americans. <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, answering questions after a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said that although he has no sympathy with Cuban communism or with South African racism, leaders such as <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> have a legitimate complaint. `` <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> have been mistreated by the press'' because reporters have not let them be heard fairly, he said. All world leaders `` have the right to present their point of view without some reporter, especially a reporter from this country, acting like judge and jury, confronting and convicting and then spreading news of that conviction,'' said the 64-year-old chairman and founder of the internationally circulated newspaper <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. Since February, <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> has visited 19 countries and interviewed 15 heads of state in the newspaper's `` JetCapade'' reporting venture. <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, who is midway in the tour with members of his staff who fly aboard a private jetliner, said he believes he has gained access to a wide variety of world leaders, including <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, because his newspaper is `` informational rather than confrontational.'' `` In the eyes of some leaders, the ` ugly American' is no longer the wealthy camera-laden tourist in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> shorts. He or she is the arrogant Nikon-carrying reporter from a big <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> newspaper,'' <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> said. `` I hope we will not be tempted to start or stop wars, dethrone presidents or kings or elect them. I do n't think that's our role,'' he said, in announcing that 5-year-old <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> would once again not endorse a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential candidate. He said, however, he has `` no quarrel'' with the newspaper's editorial board decision to call for the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> said attempts to curtail press freedom are unfortunate, `` but they go with the territory as the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> press exerts greater influence around the world.'' `` Unless we are sensitive to different political systems and philosophies, unless we try to report international issues from al perspectives, not just ours, we run the risk of perpetuating worldwide the same image of arrogance some of us suffer from here in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Worldwide, I think it's extremely important that the media from the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> practice informational journalism, not confrontational journalism. We should inform, not indict ...,'' he said. `` If we do that, foreign leaders and their people will talk to us and share their problems and their hopes. If we do n't, they'll resent us and try to shut us out. <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'s circulation and advertising revenue are at an all-time high, with average daily paid circulaton of 1.6 million, more than 105 ad pages published last week and weekly revenues of $ 3.7 million. He predicted that the newspaper, which had its first profitable quarter at the end of 1987, would either show a profit or a marginal loss for all of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> owns and operates 90 daily newspapers, 35 non-dailies, 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, and the largest outdoor advertising operation in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to a company news release.

 <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>'s sole surviving son has just graduated from high school even though he suffers from the congenital illness that killed his three brothers, becoming the first of her children to live long enough to reach that goal. `` God has not given me children to keep forever,'' she said Thursday. `` He gave them to me to love and care for, they are a loan.'' <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 18, graduated this week from <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a public school for mentally and physically handicapped children. One son, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>, died when he was 5 in 1976, followed by <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> in 1979 at 15 and <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> in 1981 at 18. The cause each time was a rare, inherited disorder known as <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s syndrome, which causes mental retardation and physical abnormalities. There is no cure or therapy for the disease, which strikes only males and can cause dwarfism, deafness, heart defects and arthritic joint pain. `` He knew all his brothers and that they died in the hospital and he becomes very upset when we go to a hospital,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>. The life expectancy of children with <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s is 15 years. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> is a dwarf and is moderately retarded and deaf in one ear. `` This boy has been so close to death you could almost see it, but he's so strong,'' said his stepfather, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> did n't know her first two boys had Hunter's until after the third, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>, was born. `` In the beginning, it was like a shock to me. I cried for days,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> said. `` I kept thinking I'll have a girl and I'll tell her not to have children. I've always wanted a lot of kids. That's been my goal since I was little.'' `` There have been times when I've been frustrated, but whenever things got rough I had friends and relatives to help me over the hump,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> said. Because of the disease, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> has a small esophagus and difficulty breathing. He tires easily and can walk only about a half block at a time. `` For the last six or seven months we've been spending about $ 500-to - $ 600 a month for his medical expenses We have to have oxygen and had to get a wheelchair. We've had to struggle, but the time with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> and the other boys has been worth it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> said. The graduation was `` one of the highlights of my life,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON>. `` He's the first to live long enough to accomplish it.'' She hopes to enroll <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> in a day adult program for the handicapped so he can continue associating with other youngsters. `` He knew something exciting was going on -LRB- at the graduation -RRB-, all the people and receiving a certificate. He knew there was some sort of special conglomeration taking place. But, I think he'll be kind of sad when he learns what it means, that he wo n't be seeing the teachers and children every day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chappel </PERSON> said. `` He's always looked forward to the bus rides to school.

Tremors measuring 5.8 and 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shook the island on May 18 and May 21 but caused no damage. Buildings on Cephalonia have been constructed to withstand tremors of 7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale ever since the Ionian islands off western <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> were hit by a devastating quake in 1953.

 Only 15 children remained in the National Spelling Bee today after the sixth round as the complexity of words began drawing gasps from the audience and sighs of relief from competitors lucky enough to survive. Thirty-seven youngsters were eliminated in the contest's sixth round, bringing to 129 the number who found Thursday's words too arduous to master. A record field of 200 contestants on Wednesday began the bee, which is sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. That field had included <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, the youngest hopeful ever to make the national finals in their 61-year history. <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, a third-grader whose parents moved to this country from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1979 and operate a bookstore in <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, stumbled on `` waywiser,'' an instrument used to measure distances. She spelled it as `` weighweiser,'' then pivoted and walked quickly from the stage with her hands folded in front of her pink frilly dress when informed that she was wrong. <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, who turns 9 on June 20, cried into a tissue outside the hotel ballroom where the bee proceeded. Her mother, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>, comforted her, then turned to a reporter and said, `` She knows lots of difficult words, so the easy words she missed.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, 11, from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, had apparently recovered from a nervous stomach that had so weakened him that he had to be helped to the microphone on Wednesday. But with a bee official standing behind him, the son of a computer analyst was eliminated today when asked to spell `` fidgetiness'' _ nervous movement. `` Ohhh,'' he moaned as he learned his fate from the judges. Fifty-six hopefuls were eliminated in the first day of the competition. Wednesday's rounds featured a spelling error by bee officials themselves. They began distributing to reporters a list of words that had been asked in the first round when one journalist pointed out that a word appeared to be misspelled. Indeed, `` hitchhike'' had come out `` hitchike'' on the bee's list, and officials stopped handing it out while they penned in the missing `` h'' on all 300 copies. When the event began Wednesday, there were 102 girls and 98 boys from 47 states, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the running. None of them was yet 15 years old, even though contest rules permit entrants who have not reached their 16th birthdays, are not yet in the ninth grade and have not won previously. Last year's winner was <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, 13, from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who correctly spelled `` staphylococci,'' a bacteria. In that contest, in which there were 185 entrants, it took 876 words before a winner was declared. There were 485 words offered Wednesday. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s Third New International Dictionary, copyright 1986, which seemingly weighs as much as some of the contestants, is used as the final authority by the judges. Competitors are eliminated as soon as they misspell a word. A judge clangs a desk top bell to let each error-maker know that for him or her, the contest is over. When only two contenders are left, the rules change. If a contestant misspells a word, his or her opponent is asked to spell it correctly. If the opponent can correctly spell the misspelled word and one additional word, a winner is declared. Contest officials estimate that 8 million to 9 million children competed in local tournament that produced the 200 hopefuls who traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the finals. The event offers $ 1,500 and other prizes to the winner. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> also gives $ 1,000 to the second place finisher, $ 750 for third place, $ 500 for fourth, $ 400 for fifth, $ 300 for sixth, $ 200 each for seventh through 10th, $ 100 each for 11th through 20th, and $ 50 to each of the other 180 entrants.

 The condition of a 5-year-old boy whose arm was ripped off in a farm machine stabilized Thursday, and he was taken off the critical list at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is serious but stable, which shows he is improving and that's good news,'' said <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehle </PERSON>, hospital spokeswoman. A team of three doctors gave up Wednesday after nine hours of surgery to try to reattach <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON>'s limb. His right arm was ripped from its socket Tuesday when he poked his hand into a machine that sorts tomatoes at Singletary Farms in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where his mother works. The boy's father, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON>, is a carpenter who moved to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 10 years ago. His mother, <PERSON> Eustolia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON>, brought her son to work Tuesday because there was no one home to care for him, said <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON>, sister-in-law of the boy's father. <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> finished a preschool program last month. Mrs. <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON> told investigators that <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> asked for money to buy a snow cone just after lunch. He returned to where his mother stood sorting tomatoes and began trying to touch a rolling conveyor belt. Mrs. <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON> told him to stay away, but when turned her back for a moment, the accident occurred. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, co-owner of the farm, said the machine has a safety switch, but `` when it happened, it happened.

 A half-dozen women prisoners, held in an isolation unit in an underground <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> federal prison, are being treated so inhumanely that they may be permanently psychologically harmed, a federal judge was told Thursday. A lawyer argued that the women, all serving long terms in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, had to disrobe in rooms visible to guards, shower in stalls without curtains, did not have recreation equipment in the exercise yard, went without heat in freezing weather and were shackled hands and feet whenever they were taken out of their unit. Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> said most of the five women he represents had been placed in the special unit because of their political beliefs, not for their prison behavior, and that the purpose was `` to destroy these women.'' <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> seeking to have the women removed from the high security unit and to have it closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> has said it intends to shut down the unit in July when a new medium - and high-security facility for women will be opened in <LOCATION> Marianna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, said that the women were transferred into the unit because they posed `` a risk of external assault on the prison He said there is no medical evidence to support an accusation that they have suffered psychological harm. `` There is no question that it's constitutional to prevent prison escapes,'' he told the judge. `` At no time were the political beliefs of these women taken into account in transferring them to the high security unit.'' The arguments will continue next Tuesday. Last week, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was conducting experiments on female political prisoners at the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> institution and `` exerting psychological pressures aimed at breaking the will of the prisoners.'' There was no reference to such activity in <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON>'s presentation But he said, the women `` are suffering from restricted environment syndrome, from sensory deprivation, free-floating anxiety and depression.'' One inmate, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, was in court. She is serving a 58-year term for possessing weapons and explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and is one of seven recently indicted in the 1983 bombing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol. Another of the inmates is <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON>, convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a $ 1.6 million Brink's armored car heist in <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> that left a guard and two police officers dead Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> was linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled Brink's robbery. <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> said that Ms. <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON> had been in prison for more than four years with only one minor infraction _ that of cutting to the wrong side of a food line _ on her record. He said she was sent from prison in <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to the newly opened isolation unit in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> in 1986 without being told why. As for Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, he said, her status as a sympathizer with terrorist groups was inexplicably elevated to that of member in letter exchanges between prision officials. `` There is no need to have these women in this unit,'' <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence they were involved in any escape attempt or that they were plotting to escape.'' <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> told <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> that the women were sent there after `` a call for bodies to fill this unit.'' The unit can house 16 women but has not had more than six, he said, adding: `` What has happened is this: They realize they are running an unconstitutional unit and they are closing it down.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conducted its third nuclear test in less than three weeks Thursday, just hours after the conclusion of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Nuclear testing was one of the issues addressed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> formally agreeing to monitor each other's tests this summer in joint verification experiments. The test shook the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert and registered on seismic equipment atop hotels and casinos here, 110 miles from ground zero. The blast measured 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Soviet scientists who are setting up monitoring equipment at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site were at Mercury, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, 52 miles from ground zero, at the time of Thursday's blast The Soviet scientists also were on hand for two previous tests, May 13 and May 21. The test was the fifth announced blast this year, and the 680th announced test since the program moved to the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert in January 1951. The nuclear device was buried 2,000 feet beneath the surface of <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, a rocky patch of desert in the far northwest corner of the 1,350-square-mile test site. The blast had an explosive force of up to 150 kilotons. The atomic bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> had an explosive yield of 13 kilotons. All tests are listed as less than 20 kilotons or 20 to 150 kilotons, with advance notice given for tests at or near the upper limits. Such a notice was issued Tuesday. The force of the blast produced a gentle swaying motion at the Regency Towers high-rise condominiums in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON>. `` Everything appears normal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said as she monitored the blast from a control point 31 miles from ground zero. `` Nothing is coming out of the ground.'' The success of underground tests is measured, in part, by the ability to prevent radiation from leaking into the atmosphere. Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said she did not feel any ground motion at the control point. DOE personnel monitoring such blasts often experience a rocking motion following detonation. DOE seismic equipment atop the Golden Nugget and Mint hotels in downtown <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and the El Rancho Hotel on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> recorded the blast `` distinctly,'' according to Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON>. A similar reading was obtained at Scotty's Castle in <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 60 miles from ground zero.

 A federal judge Thursday refused to release convicted anti-Castro terrorist <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> while he appeals an immigration service order expelling him from the country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> reviewed 700 documents, many of them classified intelligence reports linking <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, 61, to two violent anticommunist groups, before denying bond. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February after spending 11 years in Venezuelan jails successfully fighting charges he blew up a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jetliner in 1976, killing all 73 aboard. He had fled <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1974 while on probation for a 1968 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bazooka attack on a Polish ship that had previously stopped in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The federal parole commission, saying it had no objection to <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s being freed, turned his case over to the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bsch </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Adorno </PERSON>, said he had a right to live in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s exile community, where he has received strong support from many anti-Castro Cubans, `` in light of the fact that he has renounced his ways of fighting communism and fighting <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> started proceedings to deport him, calling him an undesirable alien with terrorist connections. The agency said he would not be sent to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but did not specify a country where he would go. The agency said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> has `` a history of leadership and involvement in terrorist groups and activities,'' including a role in two groups responsible for more than 50 bombings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Terrorism is terrorism, no matter how long ago it took place,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. Freeing <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> would `` send the wrong message'' to terrorists, she said. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Myriam </PERSON> lashed out at the decision to keep her father in custody, blaming it on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's desire to reach a global accommodation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> does not want him free,'' she said. `` That is why my father is behind bars.'' Attorneys for <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> said they planned to appeal to the federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but his daughter said the judge had been the family's last hope. `` He's going to die in jail,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> said bitterly. `` Why do n't they just send him back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>?'' Early Thursday, <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> abandoned a compromise that he had proposed earlier to allow <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> to remain under house arrest while appealing his expulsion. <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> made no reference to that proposal in his eight-page order rejecting the petition for parole. The order said the government has a `` legitimate and bona fide reason'' for wanting to expel <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>. Under federal law, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> can hold an alien pending disposition of deportation proceedings provided it is acting in good faith. `` The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the attorney general has acted in bad faith,'' the judge said, therefore he had no power to overrule the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> decision to keep <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> in custody. His deportation case now goes to the regional commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for a recommendation.

<DATELINE>HINSDALE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The six <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs that lost all or part of their telephone service in a May 8 switching station fire should have service restored by this weekend, officials said Thursday. About 35,000 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> customers had their service disrupted when the station, which houses computerized equipment that connects local and long distance calls, was damaged in the blaze. The costs of the outage continued rising _ not only for businesses whose phone service was cut off, but also for local governments forced to pay for overtime and emergency equipment. `` I've gotten very close to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials over the past few weeks,'' said <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> Village Manager <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruskey </PERSON>. `` I'm learning about the telephone business.'' The fire also disrupted service at several automatic teller machines, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s catalog sales phones and off-track betting parlors. Crews at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s control center in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> were forced to go to a backup phone system, delaying some flights to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s O'Hare International Airport by two hours. The total cost to communities and businesses could exceed $ 100 million, officials said, and they said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> would be asked to help pay for it. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said the phone service should be restored for customers by 12:01 a.m. Sunday, more than a week ahead of schedule. About half the 35,000 customers were switched over to the new system last Friday. `` There may be a few bugs, but we're hoping for the best,'' Ms. <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said. For governments, the fire meant extra overtime and equipment to connect emergency services. The estimated costs ranged from $ 13,000 at <LOCATION> Burr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> to $ 65,000 at <LOCATION> Clarendon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said the exact cause of the fire is still being investigated. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> hired an <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, firm, <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to investigate. `` We do know that it's possibly electrical in nature,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which has promised customer rebates for the disrupted service, is facing lawsuits from several businesses. The businesses contend <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was negligent in unstaffing the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station and for having no direct telephone link with the local fire department at the time of the fire. In addition, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> has filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, asking the comission to order Bell to pay for financial losses.

<HEAD>Unacceptably High Radon Levels Found at AF Academy, Colorado Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday a new program of testing its bases for the natural radioactive gas radon had turned up two facilities inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and three outside with unacceptably high readings. Both of the bases inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are located near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. One of the three bases outside the country is <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> on the island of Guam. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it would not identify the other two overseas bases until it had notified the host country's government. The service said in a statement it was launching a more extensive radon survey of all habitable structures and preparing to take `` quick corrective action'' at the academy and <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> bases because of radon readings above the level of 20 picoCuries per liter of air. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> considers radon levels of four picoCuries or less per liter of air acceptable,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. `` For a level of radon -LRB- above 20 picoCuries -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> recommends that corrective action be taken within several months.'' The service said that at 49 other bases around the world, it had discovered one or more structures with radon levels between four and 20 picoCuries per liter. In those cases, every habitable building at the bases will be screened for the next year to determine which ones need repair work to reduce radon levels below the four picoCurie standard. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said 33 of those 49 bases were located in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The other 16 are located in foreign countries and will be publicly identified `` in the near future following notification of host countries.'' All told, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it had taken 4,404 air samples at 135 major bases and found 211, or 4.8 percent, at a level above four picoCuries. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has found levels above four picoCuries per liter in 14 percent to 20 percent of the houses they have tested nationwide,'' it added. The service declined to speculate on why the radon levels at the two <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> facilities and on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> were unacceptably high. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> became the first of the military services last December to launch a test program for radon. The Army has since followed suit and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> are considering such a move. Radon is a colorless, odorless natural product of decaying uranium in the soil. Medical research has indicated that exposure to high levels of radon over extended periods may increase the risk of lung cancer. `` Results of commercial testing in communities throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, coupled with concern about the health of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> members and their families, prompted the decision to test,'' the service said last year in announcing the program. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has said it will launch a `` mitigation program'' for those buildings where radon levels exceed the recommended <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> standards, sealing foundation cracks or installing new ventilation systems. The service estimated last year it would spend up to $ 2.6 million on the testing and up to $ 30 million on repair work. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it now appeared those figures would be overstated, but added it did not have new estimates available.

 A television tower more than twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower collapsed Thursday, killing two maintenance workers seeking to strengthen the structure and leaving one missing, authorities said. The 2,000-foot tower was reduced to a `` tangled pile of metal,'' said C.L. <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher. Workers used torches Thursday afternoon to cut through the debris in search of the third man. `` I do n't think there's any hope of anyone who was on that tower surviving,'' said patrol Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenzini </PERSON>. The center section of the tower fell with such force that it went into the ground, he said. `` It's so far down that they have digging equipment out there.'' Colony is about 25 miles from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> state lines and 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The tower belonged to KTVO-TV in <LOCATION> Kirksville </LOCATION>. The three workers were in a basket-type carrier at the 500-feet level when the tower collapsed, the patrol said. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, 15, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the tower, witnessed the collapse. `` I saw the buggy or thing they run up the tower in, and I saw this coming down and part of the tower with it,'' she said. `` You could n't see much because the dust was flying so much. I saw some of the cables snapping and we called the ambulance right away.'' Many of the 30 heavy cables that supported the tower snapped when it collapsed, witnesses said. The tower did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area, but tore down several trees, she said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>, KTVO general manager, said the workers were replacing more than 1,000 structural braces. They were employees of <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and had been working in Colony for several weeks. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> KTVO </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, was en route to the scene to speak with station personnel and the media, <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON> said. The tower was erected in September at a cost of $ 2.5 million and was one of the tallest transmission towers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities said. By comparison, the famed Eiffel Tower of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is 984 feet tall. The tower's unusual height was intended to expand <ORGANIZATION> KTVO </ORGANIZATION>'s viewing area, said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, station news director. It increased the station's audience from 40,000 households to about 120,000, officials said. `` I heard it -LRB- the collapse -RRB- and it sounded like a jet taking off,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>'s sister. <ORGANIZATION> KTVO </ORGANIZATION> went off the air about 9:50 a.m. <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON> said the station could be off the air anywhere from two days to two weeks.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> would oppose any effort to set a mandatory retirement age for jetliners even though such a requirement could boost sales of new planes, a company spokesman said Thursday. `` It would be arbitrary and we do n't think it would be necessary,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Seattle-based aerospace company, said during a break in a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration-sponsored </ORGANIZATION> conference on aging aircraft. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> raised the possibility of mandatory airplane retirement. But Gamble said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and other aircraft manufacturers have found nothing to suggest that jetliners ca n't fly safely for years if they are properly maintained. `` We could be selfish and say it would be good for us,'' <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said of mandatory aircraft retirement. `` But it is good equipment.'' `` Mandatory retirement just would n't make any sense,'' he said. The average age of the world airline fleet has increased from eight years in 1980 to nearly 12 years in 1988, said Gamble. By 2005 the average age of jetliners is expected to be 15 years. <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial planes are built to provide at least 20 years of `` economical'' service. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> called the three-day conference as a result of increased concern about the safety of older jetliners since the in-flight breakup of a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 in April. A 20-foot section of the plane tore away and a flight attendant was swept to her death, although pilots were able to land the aircraft safely. Gamble said that even before the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident there was increasing industry interest in aging plans and that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> began looking at the problems as early as 1983. Since January 1987, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been conducting an informal survey of 50 of its older planes owned by 33 airlines in 19 countries. `` There have been no surprises,'' he said of a preliminary analysis of the survey. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> recently put a 737 it purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> after an accident through an extensive series of tests that simulated more than 200,000 takeoffs and landings. `` We did n't find anything unexpected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, adding that some small cracks were found in the airplane after the test, but they were easily fixed. The Aloha plane involved in the recent accident had undergone about 90,000 landings and takeoffs.

 It's crowded at the top, at least at <ORGANIZATION> Bellefontaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. When diplomas are passed out Sunday to 185 seniors, the school will honor 14 valedictorians, each of whom managed a perfect 4.0 grade point average. `` It makes us look like we're grading on a very easy kind of basis. But these are the same standards that we've always had. This is an extremely unusual group of kids who just happen to be in the same class,'' said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the 14 valedictorians had shown their academic prowess on college admission and scholarship tests as well as in class. They earned more than $ 52,000 in scholarships, and three of them are National Merit Scholarship winners. Average ACT college exam scores for the 14 seniors was 28.6, placing them at the 95-plus percentile of all students taking the exam across the nation. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, class secretary and one of the valedictorians, credits the harmony of the class for its scholastic achievement. `` I think the strength of our class is achieving what we want through a tremendous unity,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` We work together and help each other to reach higher goals.'' But valedictorian <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendershod </PERSON> said she believes competition was critical. `` The fact that there were 13 other candidates helped to motivate us.

 An Italian journalist who was jailed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for 6 -LCB- months on espionage charges returned home Thursday and said he was whipped after being caught entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with insurgents. <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, 26, told reporters he spent three or four months in jail near the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before receiving the first of two letters from his family. <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, who looked weary but healthy, said he would describe his time in captivity at a news conference on Friday. Asked to confirm news reports that he was whipped after his arrest in November, the journalist said: `` Yes, it happened when I was first taken prisoner about 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' `` They put a gun to my head, made me put my hands on my head and an officer whipped me,'' <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON> said, then added: `` I will continue to work in this profession, and I will ask for a visa to return to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' The journalist smiled broadly when he stepped off a special private plane at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ciampino </LOCATION> airport after a flight from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, who worked for the tiny Trieste-based Albatross news agency, was greeted by his mother <PERSON> Grazia </PERSON> who hugged and kissed him. A crowd of well-wishers, including former Socialist Premier <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, welcomed the journalist when he got off the Falcon 50 aircraft. Also present was <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottai </PERSON>, secretary general of the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, who had delivered a plea for clemency to Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> from Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>. The request was granted on Wednesday. `` I want to thank President <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Bottai </PERSON>, who literally came to pull me out of the prison,'' said <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, who was wearing a blue T-shirt, gray jeans and sneakers. <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON> was arrested Nov. 14 while traveling with Moslem guerrillas battling the Soviet-backed Afghan government.

 The most powerful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> stood by on Thursday when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy stopped, boarded and escorted away a Cypriot freighter apparently suspected of carrying war-related cargo for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the guided missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was two miles away and did not get an appeal for aid that could have caused the first direct confrontation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since April 18. Six Iranian vessels were knocked out that day, including two sister ships of the frigate involved in Thursday's incident. It also was the closest brush since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> adopted a new policy allowing <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships to intervene in attacks on neutral commercial ships flying flags of other nations. The rule requires a victim to be a non-belligerent in international waters that requests assistance. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the Iranian ship was tentatively identified as the 1,540-ton frigate <LOCATION> Alborz </LOCATION> and acted within maritime law that allows for `` visit and search'' in international waters. It halted the Cypriot motor vessel <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION> in the southern gulf at about 9:30 a.m. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said the Cypriot ship `` did not request assistance and did not appear to be in any distress.'' He said the 9,400-ton <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> remained two miles away and had no radio exchanges with either vessel. `` The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had the others in view as the Iranian frigate stopped the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> ship, launched a small boat that put a search party on board and then escorted her off in a northeasterly direction,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. There was `` no communication between the merchant and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship'' and no indication the <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION> tried to make contact during the incident 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said eight Iranian naval personnel boarded the 10,000-ton freighter and it was taken to the Iranian port and naval base at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. Its listed cargo was Italian marble chips and powder, bound for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the report said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> considers <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to be allies of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, with which <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime has been at war since September 1980. Most commercial ships it has attacked were traveling to or from those countries. Iranian gunboats regularly stop and search merchant vessels to search for war-related cargo that could be bound for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, arrived in the gulf last weekend on the first assignment to the gulf of an Aegis-type cruiser, equipped with advanced long range radar surveillance and missile systems. Three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships left the gulf Thursday home ports on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The missile cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> and missile frigates <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> all played prominent roles in `` Operation Praying Mantis'' April 18. Staying behind in a <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> drydock is the missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, which struck a mine April 14. That incident led to the retaliation four days later. The Iranian frigate involved in Thursday's incident was one of two believed operational after the April 18 encounters. The frigate Sahand was sunk by American bombs and missiles and the fourth, <PERSON> Sabalan </PERSON>, was severely damaged.

Passengers deplaned on a taxiway but did not use emergency exits or equipment. Neither Walker nor Ms. <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> knew how far into the takeoff the airliner had gotten before the abort, but the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the jet had reached at least 100 knots, or 115 mph. They did not know the actual distance between the planes. `` Captain did a good job in reacting quickly when he saw the other aircraft,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who would not release the names of the crew. Ms. <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> initially reported that four of the DC-10's tires blew after the abort, but later she and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> explained that the tires have a safety plug that melts when heated to a certain temperature, letting the tires deflate rather than explode.

<TEXT>
 It would n't have the lovable personality of R2D2, but an artificial intelligence system being developed for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would perform many of its tasks, including alerting a pilot to key points in an air battle. The `` pilot's associate'' program, a version of which was demonstrated Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> because of the proliferation of high-speed, high-tech weapons and aircraft systems, said Maj. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Weert </PERSON>, director of the program. Today's pilot is inundated with information about his plane, other planes, radar installations hoping to hit him with surface-to-air missiles and other threats. `` In the heat of battle, there's a tendency to get overloaded with everything that's taking place,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Weert </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> version of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Top Gun'' school. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, working independently under <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts, hope to take advantage of advances in artificial intelligence to produce a computer that would focus the pilot's attention on the most critical decisions while handling lower priority matters itself, like the vacuum cleaner-shaped sidekick of `` Star Wars'' hero <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Skywalker </PERSON>. For example, in a Central European battle scenario demonstrated Thursday, the `` pilot's associate'' copes with an overheating radar system while the pilot is firing missiles at an enemy bomber. All the while, the computer is giving the pilot a display of the missile ranges of the most threatening enemy fighters. Major new threats prompt the computer to talk aloud _ <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s model, in fact, sounds like a woman with a Southern accent The ability to pick out the biggest threats is made possible by artificial intelligence. The computer considers the pilot's planned flight path and the capabilities and behavior of enemy aircraft and draws conclusions. It may suggest avoiding some planes or attacking them, depending on the orders for each mission. And instead of merely telling the pilot that fuel has been lost, the computer would indicate whether the plane has enough to carry out the original mission and suggest a new flight path if necessary. That flight path would take into account the delicate task of weaving among enemy ground radars to prevent them from gaining a good enough fix to launch a missile. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Weert </PERSON> said that would replace educated guesswork by the pilot. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Weert </PERSON> emphasized the `` pilot's associate'' would replace neither the pilot nor, on two-seat planes, the navigator. The pilot could overrule any action proposed by the computer, in some cases simply by ignoring it. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s program manager, noted that the computer would adjust to the pilot's rejection, going to work on new proposals consistent with the pilot's decisions As smart as the new system is, it must overcome the `` notoriously slow'' characteristics of artificial intelligence computers, said <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> program manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON>. The 30-minute simulated flight replayed on video monitors for reporters Thursday actually took nearly three hours for the system to process, but <PERSON> Broadwell </PERSON> said that meets the goal for this point in the system's development.

Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that the gang members talked of how they could buy any type of weapon. `` They can buy the very latest guns, no ID,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The combination of drugs, guns and money creates a kind of unholy alliance.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he hoped the meeting would be the first of many aimed at ending gang violence, which killed 205 people in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last year. `` It's not a matter of signing papers,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has finished second in more than 30 primary and caucus contests this year, and one of the prime topics of speculation in Democratic circles is whether he is owed special consideration when it comes time for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to select a running mate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself said no to that question on Wednesday, and party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> seconded the idea in a speech in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is entitled to `` fair consideration'' but no more. At the same time, he praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for running a ` ` constructive campaign ... I think it will help in November.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> canceled his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schedule and left for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to be with his wife, saying, `` This is obviously the most important thing.'' At <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where her surgery is to be performed, Dr. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said it was not certain what caused Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' problems. `` We have seen no trauma, unless you consider that she has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 53, has been a student and teacher of modern dance for three decades. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suffered numbness and altered sensations in her hands and feet. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who said he might resume campaigning over the weekend if his wife's operation went smoothly, picked up 21 additional delegates during the day, bringing his total to 1,768 in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. He is expected to achieve a nominating majority of 2,081 by the time the votes are counted Tuesday night in the final <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries of the year in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has fewer than 1,000. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's campaign announced the beginning of a television advertising campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with a commercial seemingly designed more for the general election campaign than the primary battle with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It claims striking achievement in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' drive to reduce crime in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and said the governor `` did it with hard work, integrity, leadership. We could use some of that ... in the White House.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to explain his comments in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview in which he assailed two new right activists who have been critical of him. `` That's a longstanding feud with two individuals who do n't have any following,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The fact that I have been constantly attacked by two individuals does n't have anything to do with votes. If it did, I would n't be the likely nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' But some conservatives questioned the vice president's tactics. `` He's not running against <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and he's not running against <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. He's running against probably <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball,'' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, a former political aide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, a new right fund-raiser, and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, as polarizing influences on the party. When asked if he needed to court the two new-right activists, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There are some people that are almost self-appointed spokesmen that will make a claim for that. I do n't feel that at all.''

<TEXT>
 The government denied Honduran allegations of a cross-border raid by Sandinista soldiers and made a counter-claim that rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> attacked Nicaraguan troops. It also accused an official of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leading business organization of working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and running a spy network that stole government documentsccording to press reports Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> and two government officials had been detained in the case. On Wednesday, the Honduran armed forces said Nicaraguan soldiers crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> the previous day and attacked the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agustin </LOCATION> post six miles inside the burder, but were driven off. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said an undetermined number of Sandinista soldiers were killed. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> said the fighting occurred in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, with rebels, and a Nicaraguan soldier was captured and taken to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agustin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the Honduran foreign minister, protested the border incident and <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> replied: `` The crude manipulation of the facts contained in your note reveals the real aim of this campaign -LRB- which is -RRB- to try to create an incident between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'' and to damage peace talks between the Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras. `` Acts that occurred in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are being presented as if they occurred on Honduran soil and ... the armed forces of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> takes upon itself crimes that in reality have been committed by the Contras,'' he said. During the 6-year-old Nicaraguan civil war, the Contras have had bases in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from which they have launched attacks across the border. The Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to a temporary truce during which they are trying to negotiate a permanent cease-fire. About the spy case, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sid in a statement carried by <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> newspapers that <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> has worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> since 1985 and `` organized a network of informing agents in some institutions of the Nicaraguan state.'' <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, who was detained Tuesday, is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which is tied to the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, released Wednesday night, said authorities also detained two government officials identified as <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinales </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and Industry. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> and his secretary, <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldana </PERSON> <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON>, were `` tied to the crime of stealing documents with a secret classification by the Nicaraguan state.''

<HEAD>Janitors' Strike Threatens to Turn into Citywide Labor Showdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE CARPENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Snarled deliveries and piled-up trash in offices testify to the newest problem facing Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, already plagued by a $ 180 million city deficit. Labor officials representing 1,767 striking janitors say the 9-day-old standoff, which has been marked by vandalism and some arrests, may be headed for a city-wide labor-management showdown if it is n't defused soon. Effects of the strike and a labor boycott are increasingly evident in the downtown area to tourists and workers who frequent the 204 affected buildings, including most major office complexes. Paper and garbage are scattered all over downtown, trash bins are overflowing and employees in business suits can be seen lugging heavy packages that Teamster drivers refuse to deliver inside. Pickets are posted around the clock and a few windows have been broken and eggs smeared on the fronts of buildings where janitors continue to defy the strike. Labor leaders say they will step up the protests and may further tighten supply lines if contract negotiations remain deadlocked. Trash haulers, building engineers, construction workers, elevator repair personnel, delivery people and longshoremen are all honoring the strike, although the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> remains open. `` We see this as an important dispute because it is so visible,'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 7, said Thursday. The council represents 30 union locals and 65,000 members from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> south to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, encompassing the entire <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. `` The outcome of this dispute is going to set the tone for other negotiations in the city and maybe even the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area over the next few years,'' said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. The 3,500-member Local 87 of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, working without a contract since February, launched the strike May 24. The janitors rejected a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for a three-year freeze of their $ 11.25 hourly pay, and changes in job assignments the janitors say will cost them money. The janitors want a 50-cent hourly raise in each year of a proposed three-year contract, as well as the continued right to a leave of absence. The 11 maintenance firms in the association also are seeking a two-tier pay system in which new hires would get less than current employees. Disgruntled janitors contend they ca n't keep up with the area's high living expenses under the current proposal and claim management's hard bargaining stance may be masking an attempt at union-busting The contractors, in turn, maintain that only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> janitors make more than <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s. They say they offer job security and maintained benefits. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Intermaggio </PERSON>, representing the building owners, said they remain `` absolutely firm'' in their commitment to `` stem the rise in these outrageous wages.'' Contract talks continued Thursday for a third straight day since resuming a week after the walkout began, but Local 87 secretary-treasurer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said there had been `` zero progress'' since February. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Loyola </PERSON>, a union member for 33 years and a unit foreman, said the disturbance that resulted in five arrests on Tuesday is increasingly likely to recur as the stalemate continues. While some 300 janitors marched through the Financial District, two protesters were arrested after they allegedly struck a police officer with picket signs and three were arrested for vandalism and disturbing the peace. Local 87 President <PERSON> Wray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> angered police earlier by saying that although he does not condone violence, vandalism is `` an emotional outlet'' and he `` might even break one or two -LRB- windows -RRB- myself at times.'' The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating the boycott, criticized <LOCATION> Agnos </LOCATION> this week for not taking stronger steps to end the dispute. After meeting with 14 local labor leaders, the council asked Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to mediate the strike. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did not immediately respond. `` It would seem to me that to maintain harmony in the city, he -LRB- <LOCATION> Agnos </LOCATION> -RRB- could have called in people sooner,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the council. `` I think this needs direct action.'' Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> <PERSON> Roff </PERSON> said the mayor has been talking to people behind the scenes and urging the two sides to settle their differences at the bargaining table. <PERSON> Roff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> had no immediate plans to participate directly in the talks, although he acknowledged having received a few complaints about the downtown disruptions.

<TEXT>
 The Education Department's budget for research and development fell by 33 percent after inflation between 1980 and 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. At the same time, the federal government's overall spending on research and development rose 24 percent, the agency said in a report to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> education subcommittee. But most of the growth was in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, where R & amp; D expenditures shot up 81 percent during the 1980s, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The Education Department spent $ 132 million on research and development in 1980 and $ 124 million in 1987. The latter figure, taking inflation into account, was the equivalent of $ 88 million in 1980 dollars, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Defense expenditures on R & amp; D rose from $ 13.9 billion to $ 36.1 billion. The 1987 figure was the equivalent of $ 25.2 billion in 1980 dollars. The government's overall R & amp; D spending rose from $ 31.7 billion in 1980 to $ 56.1 billion in 1987, or in terms of 1980 dollars, to $ 39.4 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Such departments and agencies as <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> registered real increases, but <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D spending fell at the departments of Agriculture -LRB- down 2 percent -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- down 16 percent -RRB-, Energy -LRB- down 29 percent -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- down 35 percent -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- down 39 percent -RRB- as well as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- down 47 percent -RRB-. The report said that <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> has experienced a cut of 34 percent in constant dollars since 1980 and more than 50 percent since 1978.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teamsters attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> said Thursday any scaled-down plan for government supervision of the union would be just as unacceptable as a straight takeover contemplated earlier. Federal law enforcement sources said <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, was considering modifying plans to seek a takeover following a failed attempt by federal prosecutors to convict Teamsters officials of corruption. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> initially wanted to force Teamsters leaders out of office and put the union under court trusteeship. Instead, he likely will file suit seeking a court-appointed monitor to oversee some organization activities, according to the sources, who spoke only on condition they not be named. Such a lawsuit still could seek removal of some members of the union's executive board, the sources said The sources were confirming a story in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> plans to forward recommendations soon to acting Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> on how to proceed against the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whether you call it a monitor or a trusteeship, it's still an undemocratic attempt by the government to become involved in the supervision of a free trade union,'' <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> said. `` It does n't appear to me to be any change; it's still business as usual `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration started with the air traffic controllers and it appears they want to end with the Teamsters,'' <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> added. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired striking air traffic controllers in 1981. On May 4 a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> aquitted <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> and eight associates of charges they rigged the elections of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in 1981, and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> in 1983, as <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> presidents. Although acquitted of the election-rigging charges, <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> and six others were found guilty by the same jury of rigging multimillion-dollar bids in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> construction industry. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who recently underwent surgery for brain cancer, is awaiting trial on criminal charges in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> that he allegedly misappropriated $ 700,000 by keeping non-working `` ghost employees'' on the union payroll.

 <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> remembers finding a veteran with frostbitten feet living in a <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> garbage can last winter. He was treated at a hospital and is now working. Then there was the drunken 54-year-old Korean War veteran in <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> who had n't held a steady job since 1953. When he sobered up, doctors found he was a schizophrenic. Or the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> typist with psychiatric problems who'd been living on the streets since her discharge in 1982. The three are among thousands of homeless, mentally ill veterans located and helped under a two-year, $ 10 million pilot program launched in 43 communities around the nation by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last year. About 240 of those people have been located by the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> office, the only one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who runs the office. `` The reason they're homeless is the same reason as anyone else, for alcohol and substance abuse,'' he said recently. Causes could be anything from pre-existing mental illness to delayed stress syndrome brought on by war experiences, he said. `` The single male in general has fallen though the cracks in all health projects in the past,'' <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> said. `` You send a single male to -LRB- social agencies -RRB-, and unless they're disabled they tell him to go to unemployment and find work. `` What he needs is food in the belly and a place to stay,'' he said. So <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> searches the alleys, the rescue missions, the drunk tanks, under bridges, old rail cars and other collecting grounds for the homeless and mentally ill. Those who are veterans are steered into a variety of VA and community programs Non-veterans are referred only to community programs, <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> said. `` A lot of veterans are eligible for benefits that other homeless may not be,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Walla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> hospital. Among the programs are medical care, housing and welfare assistance, education programs and job training. In the first seven months of the pilot program, there were contacts with about 10,000 veterans nationwide, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Of the 7,800 veterans who received formal assessments of their cases, 86 percent showed symptoms of mental illness, he said. `` A lot of studies indicated a significant portion of the homeless population are veterans and a significant number of them may be emotionally disturbed,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we've gotten all of them,'' he said. The goal is to get them back on their feet. `` If a veteran is willing to work, I can get him a job now,'' <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> said. `` No ifs, ands or buts.'' The homeless vet with the frostbitten feet, who had been stationed in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the 1960s, was found to have a drug problem, was hospitalized and is now working, <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> said. The 31-year old former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> typist is hospitalized wih multiple psychiatric problems, which may have been aggravated by her service stint, <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> said. The vet suffering from schizophrenia qualified for some back pay, and has moved to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> for treatment at a veterans hospital. <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, 44, who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1968-69, said 90 percent of the homeless vets suffer alcohol or drug problems, which can be a self-medication for delayed stress syndrome. `` To get rid of nightmares and flashbacks, the greatest medicine is alcohol, and it's readily available,'' <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Doctor Terms Kitty Dukakis' Spinal Surgery `Urgent'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will undergo surgery Friday morning to remove two herniated discs that are pressing on her spinal cord, an operation described by one of her doctors Thursday as `` not emergency but urgent.'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said that if left untreated, the condition could leave the wife of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor paralyzed. However, he said it appeared to have been spotted early, and there was no sign of permanent damage. `` In view of the fact that this condition has quite definitely worsened in the past 24 to 48 hours, it was felt that waiting even until next week was taking a chance,'' he said at a news conference. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON>, a neurologist, is a member of a team that confirmed her diagnosis at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she is scheduled to have the operation. He said the damaged discs were first spotted by doctors at Cedars of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said he considered the surgery, known as cervical laminectomy, `` not emergency but urgent.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' problems were caused by two herniated discs in her neck. These discs serve as soft cushions between the bony vertebrae that protect her spinal cord. In her case, these discs have squeezed out of place so that they press on the spinal cord. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said this could cause severe damage to the spinal cord resulting in permanent paralysis. `` Fortunately, she has come to us early before any damage is evident.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortara </PERSON> said most people with herniated discs are treated first with bed rest, traction and pain killers, and surgery is used only as a last resort. However, he added, `` If someone has any evidence of spinal cord compression, that becomes much more serious and urgent.'' <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said that discs can be damaged by injury or it can happen spontaneously. He said the doctors are unsure what caused Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' problems `` We have seen no trauma, unless you consider that she has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 53, has been a student and teacher of modern dance for three decades. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suffered numbness and altered sensations in her hands and feet as a result of herniated discs. Although she noticed the problems several weeks ago, the symptoms have worsened in recent days. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said the operation, which he described as major surgery, would take several hours. The surgical team will include Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON>, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery and a friend of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> family, as well as Drs. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehrich </PERSON> said serious complications of the surgery are very rare, although they can include paralysis if the spinal cord is damaged. During the operation, doctors will remove bone from her hip and use it to replace the damaged discs. Her recovery in the hospital was expected to take one or two weeks. Doctors said that her problem, while not rare, is far less common than herniated discs in the lower back that do not press in the spinal cord. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entered <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> General on Wednesday night after flying to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> disclosed last year that she had been addicted to amphetamines for 26 years until she entered a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> clinic in 1982. She said she began taking the pills to curb her appetite and became addicted.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> congratulated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Thursday on his `` tremendous success'' at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, laying on pomp and panoply for what was probably his last visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, stopping over for two days en route home, spent a relaxed day having tea with the queen, watching parades and basking in tributes from his longtime friend and ideological soulmate, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. She told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` I warmly congratulate you,'' especially on his stance on human rights and his street encounters with Russians, a senior British official said. `` She argued that the Russian people would find it difficult now to see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a threat in the future,'' the official said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. Other British officials reported that at a small dinner for 19 people at her No. 10 Downing St. residence, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> called his work at the summit `` a tremendous success'' heralding `` a new era in East-West relations.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will take his place in history as one of the greatest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents,'' she told her dinner guest. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on his third presidential visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, warmly clasped elbows with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as she greeted him in the graceful columned quadrangle of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. He is to deliver a speech Friday on East-West relations. During their 45-minute talk at No. 10 Downing Street, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> he believed Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` to be vigorous and determined to carry out'' his reform program, a British official said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> he was not prepared to be rushed into a strategic nuclear arms agreement, said the official, who added: `` and we do n't have any reservations about the position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on this.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> promptly accepted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s invitation to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November, after the presidential election, to see him once more before he steps down. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was assumed she would also meet the president-elect. The visit promised to be a fond goodbye from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, an ideological ally who shares her belief in capitalism and distrust of communism. By stopping to brief Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was demonstrating his esteem for the woman whose nine years in office have paralleled his own tenure and made her the Western alliance's senior leader. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rested at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence before going to <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, where he passed a crowd estimated by police at 1,500. There were waves and cheers, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> waved back from his limousine. The queen, wearing a sapphire-blue silk dress, greeted the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in the marble-columned entrance hall of her 285-year-old palace. `` Nice to see you again,'' she said. `` How are you Mr. President?'' To a reporter who asked whether he was glad to be here and not in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> grinned and replied: `` Let me put it very simply: I'm very happy to be in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' Many of the onlookers were Americans who had waited up to two hours to see <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I live about 30 miles from his ranch and I do n't bother to visit him,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` And here I am, half way around the world, standing in line waiting to get a vague glimpse of him.'' <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was enthusiastic about the American president. `` I think he's a good bloke,'' she said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> drove from <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> to a ceremony outside the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> while Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned to the ambassador's residence to receive a visit from Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> The president stood on a dais in the quadrangle flanked by the prime minister, who was in a black suit and wide-brimmed black and white hat. Welsh Guards in tall black bearskin caps and scarlet tunics played the American anthem and two <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> hits. After inspecting the guard of honor, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went next door to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s home at No. 10 Downing St. and briefed her on his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In a special show of esteem for the 77-year-old president, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> allowed cameras to film them in the Cabinet room, which is usually closed to photographers. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was later greeted at Downing Street by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s husband <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> who bent and kissed her hand before escorting her inside to join their spouses for drinks and a dinner of lobster mousse, chicken with pate de fois gras and raspberries. There was also a parade outside the 300-year-old Downing Street residence, the ceremony of Beating Retreat, an annual event in ceremonies leading up to the queen's birthday. The parade, dating back to 1727, includes 406 musicians and 61 horsemen in colorful garments, and is televised live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Air Force One brought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where he stepped onto a red carpet and was greeted by Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. He then flew by helicopter in drizzling rain to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s home in Regent's Park. Police mounted massive security, checking sewers for bombs, sealing the access holes on lampposts and placing barricades along <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s travel routes. Rooftop marksmen and policemen with submachine guns patrolled the VIP area at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. On Friday, while Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> meets with <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will confer with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. He then drives to <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the financial and historic heart of the capital, to speak from one of the most hallowed platforms outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guildhall </LOCATION>, where mayors of the city have presided since the 12th century. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will make a public farewell tribute to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> there. Celebrities including playwright <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> and actors <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said they would hold a silent vigil outside the Guildhall during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 62, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first woman prime minister, has been elected three consecutive times and may seek a fourth term. She describes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is leaving office after this year, as `` cantering up to a very strong finish ... There's no sign of slowing down at all.'' Of herself, she says she hopes `` to go on and on.''

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney general Urges Maximum Sentence For TWA Hijack
Defendant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday he hopes a man accused in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking gets life in prison. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> to attend a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> interior and justice ministers. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem who goes on trial July 5 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on charges of air piracy and murder in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. `` We hope that he -LRB- <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> -RRB- will be successfully prosecuted and appropriately sentenced,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` We believe that because of the severity of the crime that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> should receive the maximum life sentence.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed during the hijacking and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> juvenile court hearing <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s case could give him a life sentence. It also could rule that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was under age 21 at the time the hijacking began and try him as a juvenile. In that case, he could receive a maximum of 10 years in prison. When he was apprehended, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> gave his birthdate as June 13, 1964, but later maintained he was two years younger. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987 after customs agents found liquid explosives in his luggage and discovered his identification papers were forged. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> met with European ministers representing the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> TREVI </ORGANIZATION> group, which meets to coordinate anti-terrorism efforts. <ORGANIZATION> TREVI </ORGANIZATION> is an acronym for Terrorism, Radicalism, Extremism, Violence International. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not an official member of the group, but for years <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has met with ministers within the framework of TREVI talks. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he would present a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to strengthen security cooperation during the meeting Friday and Saturday. He declined to detail specific <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suggestions, but said there were several areas where cooperation could be expanded. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials hope for increased exhanges of intelligence on terrorist groups and drug smuggling operations. `` Cooperation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has already been a material factor in decreasing terrorism,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` But it remains a serious problem.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also urged creation of a unified program of border security checks before the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> loosens travel restrictions in 1992.

<HEAD>Anti-Secrecy Groups Filing Suit Against FBI Library Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two groups announced Thursday they are filing suit to force the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to disclose information about a program using librarians to monitor suspicious library users. A spokesman for one of the groups, the liberal People for the American Way, said the suit follows unsuccessful attempts to get information about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Library Awareness Program through the Freedom of Information Act. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, said the suit was being filed by his group and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We believe that information is the currency of democracy,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION>. `` Therefore, anything that constrains the flow of this valuable information damages the liquidity of the marketplace of ideas and thus damages democracy itself.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> contends the program is an essential counterintelligence effort. In a report released last month, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet intelligence agents seeking sensitive technological information are among the most enthusiastic users of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> libraries. But <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> uses techniques of intimidation to enlist library officials. <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> cited several instances of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents instructing librarians to look for suspicious, anomalous or `` funny behavior'' by people using libraries. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 50,000 library workers, has also been critical of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> measures, accusing the agency of undertaking a `` generalized effort to solicit librarians to do surveillance work.'' People for the American Way claims 250,000 contributors nationwide. It opposes censorship of school materials, religion in politics and what it considers excessive government secrecy. The National Security Archive is a security research group founded by <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> to publish formerly classified government materials. <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> efforts have been reported in public libraries as well as university and technical libraries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report said Soviet agents have been using libraries for 26 years to identify the nation's `` emerging technology'' before it can be classified or restricted. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee last month that the Library Awareness Program was an important counterintelligence program and that librarians are free to refuse <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> requests for information about patrons.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> parted company Thursday expressing confidence they had advanced the cause of peace during five days of a `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring.'' En route home, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped overnight in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a sentimental visit with a steady ally. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> honored <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with a dinner for 19 at No. 10 Downing Street. She told him the summit was a `` tremendous success'' heralding `` a new era in East-West relations.'' She told told her guests that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will take his place in history as one of the greatest <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. presidents.'' At a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> farewell, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could have accomplished more, although they did manage to `` divert the train of U.S.-Soviet relations from a dangerous track to a safer one.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied that he and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> `` for all our days'' will remember the people of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> _ `` the faces of hope, hope for a new era in human history, an era of peace between our nations and our peoples.'' `` We think of you as friends,'' he told the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. And thus ended the first presidential trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 14 years. Asked later about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s criticism of the pace of negotiations, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I'd like to speed them up.'' He offered no elaboration. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiators are scheduled to resume talks, but not until July 12. Just hours after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> departed, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told several hundred peace activists that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s human rights campaign would not change Soviet policy. He said the Russians do n't need `` advice on how we run our affairs.'' Meantime, the British turned on the pomp. When the president came to her 285-year-old palace for tea, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> greeted him with a simple handshake and a `` Nice to see you again. How are you, Mr. President?'' A band played the tunes of 100-year-old <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> songwriter <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has been her steadiest supporter in the West. He grasped her warmly by the elbow. There was also a parade outside No. 10 Downing Street, an annual event in ceremonies leading up to the queen's birthday. The parade, dating back to 1727, included 406 musicians and 61 horsemen. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the November election, and she promptly accepted. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was assumed she would also meet the president-elect. A senior British government official, briefing reporters on condition he not be identified, said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was `` gratified'' that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had mingled among Muscovites. She told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> people would find it difficult now to see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a threat,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned to meet Friday with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and deliver a speech on the state of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who made a side trip to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, gave the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies an upbeat summit assessment and said `` it's certainly possible'' that the superpowers could agree on deep nuclear cuts before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January. `` We share his opinion that it was a successful and substantial summit,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, West German foreign minister, after meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` Through this summit the American-Soviet relationship got a new stability, a new perspective.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had hoped to find the formula for a 30 to 50 percent slash in strategic weapons. That goal evaded them, but they agreed on two `` confidence building'' treaties and established a personal warmth. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took pleasure in the outcome. He said `` this summit in this <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring'' had fulfilled its promise. A less-than-euphoric tone was struck by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s special adviser for arms control matters. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> where, his staff said, he told Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> that progress on strategic disarment was made, but cautioned: `` Let's remember that the Soviet negotiators always seek to cripple us in areas where they fear we might utilize our comparative technological advantages.'' By stopping here to brief Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was demonstrating his esteem for the woman whose nine years in office have made her the Western alliance's senior leader. The trip to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was likely to be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last as president, although the pair will meet again in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> later this month for the seven-nation economic summit. The Reagans looked drawn and tired as they left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a downpour. `` He is tired, I guess he looks tired. We're all tired,'' acknowledged White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, talking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were `` going at it pretty heavy until the end'' and disagreed over whether a communique should embrace the concept of `` peaceful coexistence'' _ a term coined by the Soviets that became part of their Cold War jargon. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking a farewell to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, seemed to agree that the talks were not always smooth. `` Our dialogue has not been easy,'' the Soviet leader said, `` but we mustered enough realism and political will to overcome obstacles and divert the train of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Soviet relations from a dangerous track to a safer one. `` It is, however, so far, been moving much more slowly than is required by the real situation, both in our two countries and in the whole world,'' he said. He added: `` Over the past three years, our two nations have come to know each other better. They have now taken a really good look in each other's eyes and have a keener sense of the need to learn to live together on this beautiful planet Earth.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that their parting was occuring in a Kremlin hall named for the Order of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> and said, `` I would like to think that our efforts during these past few days have slayed a few dragons and advanced the struggle against the evils that threaten mankind ... And I would like to hope that like <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, with <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s help, peace and freedom can prevail.''

<HEAD>House Approves NASA Authorization Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave overwhelming approval Thursday to an $ 11.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill that includes nearly $ 1 billion for the start on a space station but nothing for a free-flying, unmanned, factory in space. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is not likely to go along with authorizing anything near that amount. Some senators have expressed an inclination to vote for no more than $ 10.2 billion for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, an amount that could kill the space station project. For the first time, the House authorization bill puts a cap of $ 24.2 billion on the total cost of the space station, which is planned to be in orbit around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and occupied by astronauts at the end of 1996. A year before that it would be available for periodic visits by astronauts. Also, for the first time, the bill authorizes spending for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for three years _ $ 11.5 billion in 1989, $ 14.4 billion in 1990 and $ 15.7 billion in 1991. The amount for 1989 is what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked for and represents an increase of 29 percent over the $ 8.9 billion authorized for this year. The vote was 360 to 26. The bill authorizes no funds for the mini-space station that would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle, then leased by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> from its developers for $ 700 million over five years. It allows the space agency to request proposals for such a facility but specifically bans the awarding of any contracts, except for studies by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Under the House bill, a 12-member `` <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'' would be established to prepare a detailed proposal for a joint manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Development of the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION>, which is opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, is authorized by the bill. And the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calls for a flight demonstration for a hypersonic space plane _ one capable of flying at least five times the speed of sound _ by 1995.

 A Colombian cocaine dealer whose arrest prosecutors called second only to drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>' in importance was sentenced to 60 years in prison Thursday. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Auli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, 38, ran a Bogota-based drug trafficking ring that smuggled $ 32.5 million worth of cocaine to cities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to his indictment. He was snared in a sting federal agents had dubbed Operation Pisces. `` We do n't usually catch people of your caliber,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> said as she imposed the 60-year sentence for one count of operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the charge in a plea bargain, escaping the maximum life sentence possible under the law. But <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, said his client probably would spend the rest of his life behind bars `` The 60-year sentence is a functional life term,'' said <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. `` He has to serve at least 40 years without parole.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was indicted in the Drug Enforcement Administration money-laundering sting Operation Pisces, along with top <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> figures <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, who have escaped custody. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> apparently kept his operation separate from the cartel's, but special <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said he was second only to <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in major drug figures arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, a top cartel manager, was convicted of cocaine smuggling in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> supervised his own far-flung empire, said Ms. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, overseeing drug laboratories in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> area as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distribution of the drug. His undoing was Operation Pisces, a three-year sting operation in which the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> set up undercover agents as money launderers while cracking down on the traffickers' traditional conduits. In all, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents handled 325 transactions averaging $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million each, agency officials said. The sting supplied the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> with enough information for state and local authorities to arrest more than 350 people from 1984 to 1987, as well as seize more than 19,000 pounds of cocaine with a wholesale value of $ 270 million. Operation Pisces ended in April 1987 with the indictment of 115 people in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was caught that same month when an undercover agent lured him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by promising to introduce him to Mafia money men who would launder his drug cash. He was arrested as he stepped off the plane at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

 Some of the 57 men killed in the Stolzenbach coal mine survived a devastating gas explosion but suffocated when their emergency masks ran out of oxygen, officials said Thursday. Among the dead was an 18-year-old who was on his first shift as a miner when the explosion occurred Wednesday afternoon in what an official described as `` one of the most modern and best-equipped lignite coal mines around.'' The young man had `` graduated from school last Friday and wanted to earn some money before continuing his education,'' Mayor <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> would not give the young man's name, honoring the family's wishes Rescue workers brought the first 11 bodies to the surface Thursday afternoon and took them to a temporary mortuary in metal caskets. <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Milde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state interior minister, said 36 bodies had been found and the others were scattered over a wide area underground. <PERSON> Milde </PERSON> said earlier Thursday that 12 bodies had been taken from the mine, but changed the number after talking with rescue workers. Fourteen of the dead miners were Turkish immigrants. Families and friends _ Germans and Turks together _ clung to each other at the mine 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, eyes red and swollen from tears and lack of sleep. Around them, men with with grim faces black with coal dust and soot moved to and from the mine intent on retrieving all the bodies. `` My son <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> is down there. He's been a miner for 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, who waited at his son's house. `` God, let him be alive. He has two small children.'' <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON>, a state mining official, said: `` The chances of finding any survivors have sunk to zero.'' Rescue workers broke through tons of debris and battled rising water in the effort to retrieve the bodies of all 57 victims of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s worst mining accident since 1962. `` Some of the dead were found with their miners' breathing masks on,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, head of the Hesse state mining board. `` That means they survived the blast and apparently ran out of air.'' He said the emergency masks had about three hours of oxygen, but <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON> put the time at about 45 minutes. <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said the explosion was caused by a buildup of methane gas. A report on the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network said investigators were speculating that a short-circuit from a power tool may have started a chain reaction of explosions inside the mine. <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said that was possible, because `` coal dust can become dangerous if it gets mixed with methane gas and there is suddenly a spark.'' About Stolzenbach, he said: `` This is one of the most modern and best-equipped lignite coal mines around and it has been inspected many times, including recently.'' <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walscher </PERSON>, the local prosecutor investigating the disaster, told reporters it could be several days before all the bodies are located and brought out. `` The water is rising in several places, hampering the attempts to get the bodies out,'' he said, and workers were pumping fresh air into the mine to minimize the risk of another gas explosion. <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said the danger of another methane buildup persisted and `` Rescue work is being hindered by heavy damage. ... Teams can proceed only with oxygen masks.'' <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> said carbon monoxide levels inside the mine had receded, but still were severe. <PERSON> Milde </PERSON> said officials planned Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Moslem religious services at a local school where the bodies were to be taken and where relatives assembled earlier Thursday. Turkish consulate representatives also were at the scene. They said state officials had confirmed that the total number of Turkish victims was 14. Some of those killed will be taken back to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for burial, they added. Wednesday's explosion blew the roofs off at least three buildings at the mine, knocked down sheds and shattered windows and sent debris flying that seriously injured eight miners on the surface. The mine is in a field, with the nearest homes about 500 yards away. The explosion was the worst mining accident in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since February 1962, when 299 miners were killed at <LOCATION> Voelklingen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state. About 170 people have been employed in the <LOCATION> Stolzenbach </LOCATION> mine, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, one of the largest West German utility companies.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> dropped `` The Slap Maxwell Story'' after its star, <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, and producer and creator, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>, refused to continue working together, the president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` We never really had an opportunity to renew the show or cancel it,'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said at an informal meeting with newsmen in his office. `` The way it was presented to us was that if <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> continued with the show, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> would n't do it. And if <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> stayed with the show, <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> would n't do it. It just went its way.'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he did not know what caused the conflict between <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>, neither of whom was available for comment. <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was working on a movie for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> called `` Sooner or Later.'' The show, with <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> as an acerbic sports writer, did poorly in the ratings and had particular trouble reaching women viewers. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he felt it was essentially a variation of `` Buffalo Bill,'' which <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> did for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> several years ago. `` We felt the show had problems with women,'' said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. `` They had trouble caring about that character. But <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> runs his show, very clearly. We talked to him and made suggestions, but he does what he wants to do.'' <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> was also the creator and producer of `` Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' which was canceled by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> met with newsmen to discuss the new schedule and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for the future, although he avoided answering questions about contingency plans for fall programming should the writers strike continue Although <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> finished last season in second place in the ratings, ahead of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, he said he still considered <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> the third network because it took second on the basis of the Winter Olympics, World Series and the Super Bowl. `` We think the quality of our programming continues to move forward,'' he said. `` We have a long way to go in that direction but we are committed to quality programming. We were lucky this spring that some of our tryout shows caught on with the public, like ` The Wonder Years,' ` The Ten of Us' and ` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.''' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest problem show appears to be `` Moonlighting,'' which irked many viewers this past season with numerous reruns. Another problem was that <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, who co-stars with <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, was pregnant. `` We're making some headway against the problem of repeats,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. `` That is a serious problem but we look for more original shows. The writers strike is causing creative problems at this time, but in the future I'd like to see a greater balance in the stories. `` We want ` Moonlighting' to return to being a detective show and to put less emphasis on the relationships. We want it to get back to being a detective show. We have great writers and a great cast and I do n't think that'll be too difficult.'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he expected <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-hour miniseries `` War and Remembrance,'' a sequel to `` The Winds of War,'' to begin in February. He said a final decision on how to schedule the series would be made soon. The series, based on the book by <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>, could not be scheduled in the fall because of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the Olympics `` which has tied up all the advertising money.'' `` I've seen 18 hours of this show,'' he said, `` and you ai n't never seen anything like this Not ever! I think this show is going to bring people back to television who have n't watched in years. And it's not just one show. It's 30 hours long.'' The final scenes for `` War and Remembrance,'' including a tank battle and miniatures for the Battle of Midway, are now being filmed. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said a 26-foot submarine miniature had its front end blown off during filming when two torpedoes were fired at the same time and exploded.

<TEXT>
 The chief minister of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> state spoke Thursday of plans to salvage a fortune in precious gems, jewelry and artifacts from a Portuguese treasure ship that sank in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> in 1512. The national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> quoted Chief Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thamby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chik </PERSON> as saying talks between the state and the federal government `` will be carried out as soon as possible to enable salvage operations -LRB- to begin -RRB- and to recover the treasures.'' <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the wreckage of the Flora de la Mar was discovered in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> waters by a salvage team which conducted a three-year study of the sinking, the agency reported. History records indicate the Flora de la Mar was used to ferry treasures seized after the Portuguese conquered <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> in 1511. The ship was on its way to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> when it struck a coral reef during a storm and capsized in January 1512. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> was quoted as saying that several precious items were believed to have been saved by Portuguese naval commander <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Albuquerque </PERSON>, who was aboard the <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION> de la Mar when it sank and was rescued by another ship. The items _ including a gold sword, rubies, gold bangles and a gold ring _ were gifts of the King of <LOCATION> Siam </LOCATION> to King <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> as telling the agency in an interview in <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>, 72 miles south of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, that replicas of some of these items were expected to be exhibited at the <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> Sultanate Palace early next year.

<HEAD>Disparity in Kidney Transplant Rates Found, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White men suffering from kidney failure are more likely to get a kidney transplant than are women or minorities, a new study says, but an transplant expert says that the statistical differences are n't the result of bias on the part of doctors. A study in the June issue of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> showed 31 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> men who had undergone long-term dialysis received a transplant, compared with 21 percent of the women Among minority patients, 20 percent received a transplant after long-term dialysis compared with 30 percent of white patients, said the report, based on national statistics dating to 1983. Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kjellstrand </PERSON> said the imbalance his report found does not prove `` actual bias.'' `` However, the most favored recipient of a transplant is similar to the physicians who make the final decision: a young, white man,'' said <PERSON> Kjellstrand </PERSON>, a Swedish doctor who spent several years doing research in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In certain age groups, the difference in transplant rates between races or sexes was even greater than the 3-to-2 ratio found overall. Minority long-term dialysis patients age 21 to 45 were half as likely to undergo the surgery as white patients of the same age and sex. And women of any race age 46 to 60 were less than half as likely to receiving a donor kidney as men of the same race and age, according to the report. Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>, said that for various reasons, white men are more likely to seek transplants. A recent change in the method used to allocate donor kidneys to people on waiting lists, ordered by the government, ensures against bias based on age, sex or race, he said. But women and non-whites who have had kidney failures are much less likely to be on those lists than white men, <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said blacks might be less eager than whites for transplants, because they typically do not do as well after receiving a donor kidney. But they also do not do as well on dialysis because of specialized health problems, he said. `` To get a kidney transplant, your doctors or you must get you on the list, and black patients -LRB- and doctors -RRB- may not take the initiative,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matas </PERSON>, a kidney-transplant surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. About 5 percent of the women who qualify for kidney transplants may have trouble being matched to a donor organ, <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said. Women who have been pregnant several times can develop antibodies that would reject the organ, a problem that can be detected in pre-transplant tests, he said. But that 5 percent does not nearly justify the disparity between the number of women and men on dialysis who receive transplants, he said. <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> also said women may hesitate to get transplants because `` by and large, in our society, men tend to be more aggressive and risk-taking.'' In November 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instituted a new policy for allocating donor kidneys based on objective criteria, <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said. The government enforces the system by denying hospitals Medicare if they fail to report all patients on waiting lists, all donor kidneys and all recipients. Even before the law was passed, <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said, `` there is no reason to believe there was any bias anywhere with regards to race or sex. Age is a different matter.'' He said some hospitals may have used age as a criterion before the new policy was instituted.

 Security forces killed 23 leftist guerrillas in the Andes and eastern jungle, and in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> rebels assassinated a lawyer who was recovering from an earlier attempt on her life, official sources said Thursday. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist group, ambushed a military patrol Wednesday and 12 rebels died in a 15-minute battle with troops, the military said. A brief statement said the fighting occurred in the rural highlands of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state near <LOCATION> Huanta </LOCATION>, 230 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. There was no mention of army casualties. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronica </PERSON>, the government newspaper, said 11 Shining Path gunmen were slain Wednesday in a fight with paramilitary police on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION>, a center of the cocaine trade 260 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Police accuse the Maoist rebels of cooperating with narcotics traffickers. The regions around <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Huanta </PERSON> are under a state of emergency because of the Shining Path, which began an insurgency eight years ago that has cost more than 10,000 lives. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said two men carrying concealed guns entered a hospital Wednesday and killed <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuzquen </PERSON>, 32, an alleged former member of the Tupac <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. She was recovering from an attack two months ago by the guerrillas, who have accused her of being a government informant.

 Soldiers attacked a gathering of two leftist guerrilla groups who were discussing joint operations and 25 guerrillas and eight troopers were killed in the battle, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and other Colombian cities Thursday, people honked car horns, waved flags and white handkerchiefs and sang the national anthem in an appeal to kidnappers to free former presidential candidate <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>. The shootout between soldiers and guerrillas occurred Sunday near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uraba </LOCATION>, a town in the northern banana-growing region. A report Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a northwestern city known as the center of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine trade, said 60 guerrillas had been killed in the initial fighting and in daily running battles since. According to the ministry statement, the guerrillas involved were from the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist group, and the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a Moscow-line organization. During the nationwide demonstration, which lasted 10 minutes beginning at 11 a.m., about 1,000 people assembled in a park outside the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> apartment building where <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> lives. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was kidnapped last Sunday as he left a church two blocks away. `` Colombians today have expressed the utmost unity for the immediate release of <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>,'' acting President <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> said after the demonstration. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> is minister of government.

Radio stations have received several telephone calls allegedly from the abductors, but police say they are not sure any are legitimate. Some callers claimed responsibilities for drug traffickers, others for leftist guerrillas. One said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> had died of bullet wounds. Dozens of Colombians have been kidnapped by leftist guerrillas and several have been seized by narcotics traffickers who demand that the government stop extraditing Colombian drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has not extradited anyone on drug charges in 15 months. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, publisher of the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION>, ran for president twice and has said in many editorials he wants to see <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> free of leftist guerrillas.

<TEXT>
 About 2,000 students from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> marched to the city's main square Thursday night to protest the death of a fellow student in a brawl. Foreign sources said the demonstration developed spontaneously at about 11 p.m. after students read a poster on campus describing the death earlier in the day of <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinfang </PERSON>, a 22-year-old geophysics student. Students said <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> was beaten to death by `` hooligans'' while buying liquor outside the campus. It was the largest demonstration since huge pro-democracy rallies in December 1986 and January 1987 that led to shakeups in the government and a conservative backlash against `` bourgeois liberalization.'' The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the students arrived at about 4 a.m. at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the large plaza in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, passed through it and stopped at a police office to present a list of demands. About 700 students completed the 10-mile walk from the campus in northwest <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to the square, linking arms and shouting for `` justice and human rights.'' One banner read `` pay back the blood debt.'' Police watched the march but did not interfere. In their petition to police, students demanded the arrest of the assailants, a public trial, better security around the campus and reports of in the official media. <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liben </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official, told the students at the police office that two of the attackers had been arrested, but demonstrators shouted him down with complaints about `` bureaucracy,'' the sources reported.

 Representatives of big business failed to persuade black labor unions on Thursday to abandon a three-day protest next week that is expected to take the form of a general strike. The two largest black labor federations have called for a peaceful, nationwide protest June 6-8 to express opposition to government crackdowns on anti-apartheid groups and to a proposed labor bill that would curtail unions' ability to hold legal strikes. The federations can not legally endorse a general strike, but their previous calls for national protests have resulted in widespread work stoppages. Leading anti-apartheid clergymen have endorsed the federations' latest appeal. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest union federation, met Thursday with a committee representing major employer organizations and headed by <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Godsell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The federation's general secretary, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, told reporters the protest will go ahead as planned because the business officials failed to ease union concerns about the proposed labor legislation. `` We maintain that the bill represents a major rollback of the rights of workers,'' <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Godsell </PERSON> said the bill is not `` union-bashing'' legislation. He also said the federation officials refused to promise him that next week's protest would not include stayaways. Federation leaders arranged a meeting Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which represents major employer organizations. The talks included management representatives from the country's leading industries, such as mining, metals and manufacturing. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions met Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest labor federation. The two groups, which have differed over political ideology, agreed to cooperate in promoting the protest. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says it has 691,000 dues-paying members. The Council claims more than 400,000 members. Police officials said the union groups are being monitored to see if they violated state-of-emergency prohibitions on promotion of political strikes and boycotts. Some employers have threatened to dock wages, take disciplinary action and withdraw from wage negotiations if workers take part in a stayaway. In February the government banned the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions and 17 other anti-apartheid organizations from taking part in politics. A main federation target is the proposed Labor Relations Amendment, which would make it harder for unions to strike, outlaw sympathy strikes and hold unions liable for losses suffered by employers during an illegal strike. Unions charge that major businesses have not used their influence to oppose the measure, now before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police fired rubber bullets into the air Thursday to disperse hundreds of college students demonstrating against government detentions of anti-apartheid activists. There were no injuries or arrests, Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON> said. He said that the students had engaged in a `` perfectly peaceful protest.'' An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths of time since the government declared a state of emergency in June 1986 following anti-apartheid violence. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Jackson Meets With Gang Members</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 5 grafs with comment after City Hall meeting</NOTE>

 Presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with gang members in a violence-ravaged ghetto Thursday and said he wants to end the cycle of `` desperation ... hopelessness'' that plagues their lives. `` A combination of drugs and guns and money creates a kind of unholy alliance that has left the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> residents feeling they have no way out,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said he hoped the meeting would be the first of many such talking sessions between officials and the young gang members, beginning with one that afternoon with Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> at City Hall. He talked to reporters as gang members and other residents of the <LOCATION> Nickerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> housing project milled around in the courtyard outside a two-bedroom apartment where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had spent the night with a projects family. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s closed session with more than 100 community representatives and gang members in the Watts housing project had been billed as a meeting of both Bloods and Crips, rival gangs in a city that saw 205 gang-related deaths last year. But the few dozen gang members on hand were all from the Bounty Hunters gang that dominates that area or their affiliate groups. Many sported the red colors, hats or shirts, that mark the the Bloods. Gang members and police officers said they doubted anyone could get the gang rivals to sit down together peacefully. `` I'd be surprised if they both got in there and did n't start anything,'' said Officer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>, who patrols the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> region where Watts is located. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> emerged from the meeting to announce to reporters that a meeting had been arranged later in the day at City Hall for himself, gang members Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and other officials. Initially, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s schedule included an afternoon debate with front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> canceled it Thursday morning because his wife was to undergo surgery on Friday. He flew back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to be with her. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the City Hall meeting would include discussion of ways to more effectively target resources, social programs and job efforts in the communities plauged by gang and drug problems. He described gangs as groups of people `` who form a reaction of desperation to hopelessness.'' It was unclear what else was acheieved at the morning meeting which was closed to reporters. Some local residents _ many of whom have lost friends and relatives to gang shootings _ expressed hope at the attention <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brought to their concerns, but also skepticism that any changes could be achieved. `` I do n't know, I doubt it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapla </PERSON>, 17, who described himself as aa <PERSON> Bounty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> `` marked'' by rival gangs. `` You ca n't go nowhere without somebody wanting to beat you down or shoot you. I lost three close friends'' to gang violence, he said. `` I'm tired of it. It's time for this to stop.'' Another youth, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 25, said he once shot someone in a gang feud and did n't stay around to see if the person died. `` It's no big deal. Life in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> LA </LOCATION> is tough,'' he said. But he said `` deep down inside'' many gang members do n't want to be involved in violence. He and others said virtually everyone in their community has a gun. `` It's better to be caught by the police with it, than by some other fool without it,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 25. Later Thursday, at City Hall, before <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> met with several county and city representatives and six gang members, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` thoroughly remarkable campaign.'' `` I commend you for what you have done in showing what is possible for this country,'' the mayor told the candidate. However, when questioned by reporters, he declined to directly endorse <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has n't needed anybody to endorse him. He's done it on his own,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. He credited <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with `` energizing millions of people across the country.'' When the two emerged from a private meeting, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> turned aside questions as to why it took a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> visit to spark the meeting between officials and gang members. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` in his most unique way has been able to make an appeal'' to gang members, the mayor said.

 A teen-age <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> prostitute fatally shot an 18-year-old Jewish seminary student Thursday after telling him she was tired of life and wanted to commit suicide, police and an Israeli news agency reported. Spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police were investigating whether the killing was linked to the Palestinian rebellion that began Dec. 8 in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Thursday, a court convicted four left-wing Israelis who met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials of breaking a law against contacts with members of terrorist groups. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> calls the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Thursday reiterated his opposition to holding an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was reacting to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement Wednesday that he would be willing to renew relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if such a conference took place. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks `` will not change my views. ... I do n't think we should pay a heavy price for renewing relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The Soviets broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the Arab uprising in the occupied territories will continue until Palestinians have an independent homeland. `` We need another year of continuous uprising,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a gathering of Palestinians at the emirate's presidential guest palace Wednesday night. The killing in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was the second recent attack on a seminarian in the <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which has 340,000 Jewish and 130,000 Palestinian residents. The first occurred May 26, when an Arab stabbed and wounded a Jewish student in the Arab quarter. The latest victim, <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, was a student at the Sha'arei Chesed seminary in the <LOCATION> Rehavia </LOCATION> quarter, near where he was shot. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION>, the Israeli news agency, said <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> and another student took a break from studies at 1:30 a.m. and walked through Sacher Park. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s companion, who was not identified, said they encountered a young woman who told them in fluent Hebrew: `` I'm tired of life I want to commit suicide,'' <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said they talked about two minutes, then the men walked away and the woman drew a pistol and opened fire, hitting <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> five times in the back and head. She fled but was caught by a security officer who heard the shots. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the woman confessed and described the shooting, but her name was not released because she is a minor. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a teen-age Jewish settler have been slain in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> during the Palestinian uprising. At least 199 Palestinians also have been killed, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was taken from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> along with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has formally annexed it. On Thursday, the army retracted figures published earlier this week that put the Palestinian death toll at 207. Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, an military spokesman, said the army was certain of only 152 deaths, all at the hands of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. `` All the rest are unclear and we are not going to relate to them,'' he said. The court convicted the four Israelis after rejecting defense arguments that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was not a terrorist group and the 2-year-old law against meetings with such organizations did not apply. <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dory </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Failer </PERSON> held talks with a 15-member <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in November 1986, soon after the law was passed. They said at the time they considered the meeting a test of the law. Dory called the statute `` a terrorist law against a peace dialogue'' and declared: `` We shall continue to fight it until it is revoked.'' At <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers prevented students from entering a junior high school. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the army closed the school for two weeks, accusing students of throwing rocks at Israelis who drove by. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, military commander in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said soldiers no longer will force Arab merchants to open stores during hours set by the army. Underground leaders of the rebellion have ordered shopkeepers to close in the afternoon.

 Supernova 1987A, the closest star to explode in 400 years, has provided a feast of many courses for an international army of scientists. Now the researchers are waiting for dessert: a look at a neutron star in its infancy. `` We've never before observed a supernova evolve through to the birth of a neutron star,'' <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woosley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, astrophysicist said at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> news conference Thursday. `` Now the egg is about to hatch.'' Supernova 1987A was first detected on Feb. 24, 1987. The burst of light and radiation was located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy near the Milky Way, and some 160,000 light years away. It was the first exploding star in four centuries that was close enough to be seen with the unaided eye _ but only in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> _ and scientists all over the world immediately turned powerful instruments toward the object. Since then, the progress of the explosion has been charted in minute detail as light and other radiation streamed away and were detected by instruments onboard airplanes and satellites, or carried aloft by balloons and sounding rockets, or housed in ground-based observatories. `` It has been the most completely studied phenomenon outside the solar system in history,'' <PERSON> Woosley </PERSON> said. `` It has been a grand event, as it should be since something like does n't happen but every 30 generations.'' The scientists actually are studying an event that occurred 160,000 years ago. But the star is so far away, some 960,000 trillion miles, that it has taken all of those centuries for the light to reach Earth. Visible light from the explosion has declined slowly, but data is still being collected in other parts of the radiation spectrum. At Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> news conference, scientists said the studies have confirmed some basic theories about the life cycle of stars and about the formation of fundamental elements in the universe, but Supernova'87 also has created mysteries that are yet to be explained. Among the findings reported Thursday: _ Gamma ray studies show that as the star exploded, a small amount of matter in its helium core evolved into radioactive nickel, which decayed to cobalt and finally to the stable isotope iron-56 This confirmed theories of the evolution of matter from stars. `` We have seen for the first time the creation of new matter in the universe,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scientist. _ Data from emissions of the explosion, which give indications of the star's composition, show the star had a puzzling lifetime before its explosion <PERSON> Woosley </PERSON> said it apparently spent about 9 billion years as a blue sequence star, changed its composition to a red super giant star for a million years through the loss of material equal to about four suns, and then evolved back to a blue star. He said there is no general explanation for this. _ Early in its life, the star that exploded was about 20 times more massive than the sun It's explosion came about through a gravitational collapse of shells of surrounding the core of helium. _ Light streaming from the star has been the result of radioactive decay The light has declined and will continue to do so until energy from an evolving neutron star causes the level of light to become steady. It is this event, <PERSON> Woosley </PERSON> said, that astronomers are awaiting. Detection of the neutron star could come in a year, as some believe, or it could take many years. A neutron star is the final stage in the life of a star. It is composed of neutrons and compressed to the density of about a thousand million million times that of water. Its density is only 10 percent less than that of a black hole, which is so dense that not even light can escape its gravitational field. `` If a sugar cube was dropped on a neutron star, it would hit with a megaton of force,'' <PERSON> Woosley </PERSON> said. `` That's the energy in such a force of gravity.''

 Agencies coping with the AIDS epidemic in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> praised a White House AIDS commission's call Thursday for legislation protecting the infected, and urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to follow its recommendations. A spokesman for one agency, however, challenged the report as a `` Band-Aid approach,'' saying the proposed $ 3 billion increase in AIDS spending is too little, too late. `` The commission's report is courageous, aggressive and compassionate,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, deputy executive director for policy of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based Gay Men's Health Crisis, a clearinghouse on AIDS. `` We applaude their honesty and directness in addressing anti-discrimination, explicit education, addiction treatment, violence against people with AIDS, expansion of voluntary testing and the federal government's lethargic approach to drug testing,'' he said. `` We challenge the president, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and presidential candidates to respond to this report by implementing its recommendations,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization of health professionals, lauded the report `` as an aggressive first step towards developing an integrated national strategy to deal with the AIDS epidemic.'' The recommendations `` are a rational, intelligent and compassionate response to the epidemic,'' the association said. `` It goes a long way in calling for a rational, compassionate, practical response to the AIDS epidemic, which we are yet to have in this country,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Durazzo </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> AIDS Foundation. He said the commission's report should have specifically called for the use of condoms, and should have been strong in preventing AIDS transmission among intravenous drug users. The recommendations can not be ignored by the White House in light of similar recommendations by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` We're having a very strong consensus coming together to form a good, national, practical response. `` At the White House, they have no reason to hedge the issues any more,'' he said. `` If they do, they're laying down and letting peope die.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunst </PERSON>, director of Cure Aids Now, a clearinghouse on AIDS and a service agency in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> feeding 120 AIDS patients, condemned the report as `` a Band-Aid approach to this global menace and emergency.'' <PERSON> Kunst </PERSON> said the $ 3 billion spending hike proposed `` is again woefully deficient. As a direct service agency in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, there is no money for food, for housing, for legitimate issues to keep people who are already infected alive. `` The emphasis in this report is on anti-discrimination laws for people with AIDS,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was the first state to treat AIDS as a handicap. ... None of that is saving anybody's life. `` The last thing we need is the killing us with kindness attitude. What we want is the money, the accountability and we want legitimate people involved.''

 There is no `` smoking gun'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> faculty's vote for a former professor who claims she was denied tenure at the school because of her sex, a federal judge said Thursday. Whether <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bund </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should become the fifth tenured woman in the school's 80-year history hinges on whether the evidence showed discrimination when she was denied tenure in 1981 and 1983, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 44, now a private marketing consultant, began teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. She was promoted to associate professor in 1977 and applied for tenure in 1981. She sued the university in 1984. The judge, who is expected to rule in the case next week, heard closing arguments in the eight-day trial came after attorney <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> refused the judge's recommendation to suspend the trial to question 56 professors involved a key 1981 faculty vote. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said he did not have the resources to embark on `` an extremely complicated and lengthy procedure.'' `` I think you will concede that there is no smoking gun here,'' <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said. `` What I'm interested in finding out is not whether or not her tenure review case was unfair but whether it was unfair because she is a woman.'' In closing arguments, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> maintained he had compiled `` a multiplicity of little things that put together add up to an evil.'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> maintained `` not one shred of evidence'' linked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s tenure denial to sex bias. During testimony, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> admitted that documents existed showing the school's faculty voted 47-7 to support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s tenure bid but two days later backed her by 29-27. But <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said there was no evidence that <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> used <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s sex in lobbying professors to switch their votes in 1981. Tenure decisions at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> are submitted to the faculty to gauge support for the professor; the actual decision rests with the university president. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s argument cited a number of factors which he contends prove that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was a victim of sex discrimination, including: _ Business school dean <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, a co-defendant with the university, once said the only way to get more women on the school's faculty would be to impose quotas _ At least four men who had less favorable reviews and faculty support than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received tenure from 1977 to 1984 _ A marketing expert from outside <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> who backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was specifically asked whether his recommendation had anything to do with affirmative action <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> claimed the school's tenure standards were applied unfairly to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who after being denied tenure in 1981 was given a three-year extension and asked to demonstrate excellence in marketing. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s case was `` a long train of perceived slights ... but it is wholly bereft of any evidence that a man would have been treated any differently than her.''

Traces of the drug clomipramine, known by the trade name <PERSON> Anafrail </PERSON>, turned up in autopsy tests on <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s body, <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said the tests showed no traces of any other drug. Anafrail can cause suicidal tendencies in some patients who take it, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, a pyschiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ-TV </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't think the drug would have caused Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> to go on the shooting spree. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Griest </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, psychiatrist treating Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, was involved in tests of Anafrail at a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> clinic, said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> maker of the drug. <PERSON> Griest </PERSON> can not comment on Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s case under the confidentiality of doctor-patient relationships, said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Cnare </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Madison clinic. But Ms. <PERSON> Cnare </PERSON> said, `` We are involved in clinical trials of Anafrail.'' On May 20, Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30, walked into the <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, shot a boy in the bathroom and then entered a classroom and shot five other youngsters. She fled the school and entered a nearby home, where she wounded a 20-year-old man who tried to seize the gun, then killed herself as police surrounded the house. Ms. <PERSON> Cnare </PERSON> said the drug, which has been used in other countries for two decades, is being tested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to treat `` obsessive-compulsive disorder,'' which occurs in about 1 percent of the population. People suffering from the disorder have repeated unpleasant thoughts or impulses as well as repetitive behavior, Ms. <PERSON> Cnare </PERSON> said. `` Carried to the extreme, some people spend eight hours in the shower,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said. The drug also is used to check `` repetitive thoughts of random violence,'' she added. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had exhibited various symptoms of the disorder. Residents of an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> where she once lived said she often rode the elevator for hours. Ms. <PERSON> Cnare </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> has been involved with clinical trials of Anafrail since September 1986. So far, she said, 32 adults and 30 children have been given the drug. The clinical tests are being conducted, with government approval, at 21 centers around the country.

 A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier who was caught with 18 pounds of cocaine during a traffic stop was part of a drug-smuggling ring that used bogus military IDs to operate through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, federal drug authorities said Thursday. Members of the ring got false Army identification papers, forged requests to board military aircraft and pretended to be active duty servicemen returning home on leave, said <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The members carried cocaine in luggage on flights from <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and shipped cocaine in <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> mail from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobbe </LOCATION>, also in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldkamp </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday that <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION>, was a central figure in the ring. <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> was taken into custody last week after being stopped by a state trooper in nearby <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He admitted he was carrying cocaine and agreed to cooperate with police, said Sheriff <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>. Information supplied by <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> led to the arrests of five women and one man in the past week. More arrests were expected, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. Each woman is charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. If convicted, they could each face a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $ 4 million fine. A bond hearing is scheduled for Friday in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. At an initial hearing Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> appointed lawyers to represent <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, 25; and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, 31, all of <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmela </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>, has been arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the same charge and is being held there, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit released Wednesday said <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> told investigators he traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> twice this year to meet with two members of the drug operation. He said he arranged for cocaine packages to be mailed to the three <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> women. Investigators seized two packages of cocaine last week that were mailed to <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> from a military post office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. One was an 18-pound package taken from <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>'s car on May 24 after he was stopped for having a suspended license and the other was a 29-pound package seized Friday at the <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> post office. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said military investigators were trying to determine if any active-duty personnel were involved.

<HEAD>Storm Kills 14, Six Missing in Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heavy rains from the first tropical depression of the year killed at least 14 people and drove many thousands from their homes in central <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The 3-day-old storm seriously damaged homes, bridges, roads and railroad tracks and cut off electric power and communications to several areas, said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It said a tornado touched down early Thursday at an airport in <LOCATION> Camaguey </LOCATION> city, destroying five Soviet-built MiG-21 fighter planes and several buildings. Authorities ordered the evacuation of 65,000 people in five central provinces whose homes were threatened by flooding. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said rescue crews using helicopters and amphibious vehicles evacuated at least 10,000 from their homes Wednesday and carried them to higher ground. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said Thursday the storm was downgraded to a foul-weather system and was drifting northeast from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at between 5 and 10 mph. The official <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> said six people drowned and three were electrocuted, <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> reported, with seven of the dead in <LOCATION> Cienfuegos </LOCATION> province and one each in <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and Sancti Spiritus. It did not give details on the five other deaths. The depression was the first of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, which began Wednesday and ends Nov. 30. A typical season sees 10 named tropical storms with winds exceeding 39 mph. Six become hurricanes with winds over 74 mph. Tropical depressions can become tropical storms if their circulating winds reach 39 mph. Storms become hurricanes if those winds hit 74 mph. In 1987 there were three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Rageshree </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>, a 13-year-old eighth-grader from <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, won the 61st National Spelling Bee on Thursday, scoring her victory with the word elegiacal, a form of couplets in a poem. <PERSON> Rageshree </PERSON>, the Indian-born daughter of statistics professors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, defeated <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after a prolonged head-to head match. She had placed 36th in the 1986 bee. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> stumbled on the word stertorous, an adjective meaning characterized by a harsh snoring or gasping sound. <PERSON> Rageshree </PERSON> spelled the word correctly, then sealed her victory by correctly spelling elegiacal. The winner won $ 1,500 and other prizes from the sponsoring <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, the runner-up $ 1,000. `` I'm really happy,'' said <PERSON> Rageshree </PERSON>, known to her friends as <PERSON> Raga </PERSON>. `` I have been studying hard since January, at least a couple of hours a day.'' Asked if she had any coaches, she laughed and replied, `` My mom and my dad. Also, my little sister. She's just 6, but she likes to ask words, too.'' <PERSON> Rageshree </PERSON>, who was sponsored by the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bee </LOCATION>, said she was not surprised that <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> had misspelled six in the final round and she five. `` There are always words that anyone can miss,'' she said. For <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, it also was his second appearance at the national bee. He placed 34th in the 1985 contest. He was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, 8, of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, the youngest member of the record 200-youngster field, made it to the fifth round in the annual competition. But `` waywiser'' _ an instrument that measures distance _ proved to be the instrument of her downfall. She spelled it `` weighweiser.'' The pace of attrition escalated dramatically in the fifth round, with 78 dropouts, more than five times as many as the round before. The day had started with 144 survivors from Wednesday's competition. As the stakes got higher, the spellers increasingly requested definitions, illustrative sentences, word origins and repetitions, hoping for a magic moment of revelation. <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Seesink </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, wrote frenetically on her arm with a finger, a trick that saved her Wednesday with `` pontificalibus.'' But it did n't work Thursday with `` multipotent.'' Some contestants who fluffed their words left the stage tearfully. Others saved their reactions for the privacy of the restroom or a special comfort room equipped with soft drinks and soft couches. There were a few light moments. As the contest began its second day Thursday, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, had barely repeated his word _ `` eschatological'' _ when the disqualifying bell sounded.'' What's the matter, did I pronounce it wrong? <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> asked with a grin. He went on to spell it correctly. <PERSON> Vasilios </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavrou </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Dracut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, fell victim to `` isepiptesis,'' a line on a map that shows the path of a migratory bird. He spelled it `` isepatesis.'' And `` klinotaxis'' _ bending in the direction of a stimulus _ proved fatal to <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordan </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, N.H. Her version: `` clinataccis.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, 11, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who struggled heroically through Day One on Wednesday with a stomach virus, returned Thursday only to be stymied by `` fidgetiness.'' He spelled it as `` fidgitinous.'' Contest officials estimate that 8 million to 9 million children competed in local tournament that produced the 200 hopefuls who traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the finals. The event offered $ 1,500 and other prizes to the winner. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> also gave $ 1,000 to the second-place finisher, $ 750 for third place, $ 500 for fourth, $ 400 for fifth, $ 300 for sixth, $ 200 each for seventh through 10th, $ 100 each for 11th through 20th, and $ 50 to each of the other 180 entrants.

<TEXT>
 Dissident <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON> told an enthusiastic student audience on Thursday in the increasingly liberal republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> can prosper only as a democratic confederation,'' sources said. They said <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> pluralistic political system. The sources said the noted author and former vice president of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, once heir-apparent to the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, talked to students in the Slovenian city of <LOCATION> Maribor </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> near the Austrian border. About 300 students loudly applauded him when he entered a hall in their dormitory and during and after his address, according to the sources, who spoke on condition their names not be used. Although the anti-communist themes <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON> expressed were typical of him, the fact that he was allowed to voice them was considered an event in itself. <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON>, a former comrade-in-arms of Tito, the founder of communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, spent about three years in royalist jails in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> before World War II and nine years in communist jails after becoming one of the strongest critics of communism. He was given back his passport in January 1987, for the first time since 1969, and began traveling widely, giving lectures. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most developed region and is strongly influenced by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, on its western and northern borders. In another development Thursday, the arrest of <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, an outspoken journalist and Slovenian youth leader, led to sharp public criticism in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, one of four candidates for president of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> organization, was arrested on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, a city 62 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Maribor </LOCATION>, on what police said was `` suspicion of revealing a military secret. He had published articles in Slovenian youth periodicals critical of Yugoslav army policies and leaders. He also reported on alleged plans for a military coup in <LOCATION> Solvenia </LOCATION>. `` We are embittered by <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>'s arrest and we are worried about the freedom of public speech,'' said a statement released Thursday, signed by 88 leading Slovenian intellectuals. `` We feel this is an act of intimidation,'' Police said earlier that authorities found `` a secret military document'' in a <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> software company where <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> works. The document allegedly represents the minutes of a top-level closed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting at which a plan for a possible military intervention in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> was discussed, <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>'s friends said. They said the same document was published by the <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> youth magazine in May, but authorities immediately banned the periodical, saying it contained state secrets. Last month, Slovenian youth publications said the military was planning a coup in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and intended to arrest intellectuals, journalists and others to quell dissent in the republic. A communique issued last week by the Presidency of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> denied plans for a military takeover and called the articles a `` slanderous campaign.'' <PERSON> Bojan </PERSON> <PERSON> Korsika </PERSON>, a journalist friend of <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, that <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>'s whereabouts were unknown since and that the military said he would be allowed only an official army attorney. <PERSON> Korsika </PERSON> said several youth organizations around <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> have held meetings protesting <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>'s arrest and demanding his release.

<HEAD>British Nationals Convicted in Hawk Killing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury convicted a British nobleman and two British gamekeepers Thursday of conspiring to kill protected hawks on a billionaire's game preserve. Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Albemarle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> preserve of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, and his gamekeepers, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> were convicted on the misdemeanor conspiracy charge. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>, 66, also was convicted on three misdemeanor counts of aiding and abetting the killing of hawks. <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON>, 25, also was convicted on three misdemeanor counts of killing migratory birds and on one misdemeanor count of possessing a migratory bird. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, 20, was convicted only on the conspiracy count. The jury deliberated for about 4 -LCB- hours in the six-day trial. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine. <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> could be sentenced to 2 -LCB- years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine and <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> could receive up to six months in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did not immediately set a sentencing date. Defense attorneys said they planned to appeal. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondurant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in closing arguments that the three defendants killed hawks `` from the first day they stepped on the shoot till the bust.'' <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, said predators were killed to protect the imported pheasants and other game birds stocked for <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>'s guests to hunt. <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, 73, is chief owner of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION>, a telecommunications and technology holding company. Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> listed him as the second-richest man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, putting his worth at $ 3 billion. He and his wife were not charged. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> dismissed the government's key witness, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, as a `` ne'er - do-well'' who went to federal authorities in hope of getting a job as a wildlife law enforcement <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> was fired from his job as a gamekeeper at the preserve in February. Agents of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared himself a `` refurbished candidate'' on Thursday after a week of rest and strategy talks but said he wo n't change his tactics just because he's trailing in the polls. The vice president spoke with reporters at his seaside vacation home after a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> safety check of his powerboat. `` I've never felt more relaxed, never felt more convinced that we're on the right track,'' he said. `` And I'm not going to be stampeded by polls that do n't mean anything.'' Recent public opinion polls have shown <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 10 or more points. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved slightly away from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, stressing more forcefully than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did the U.S.-Soviet differences on human rights. `` I think we have very different views on human rights than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I would suggest that Soviet retaliation against us, saying we've got human rights problems, is mixing apples and oranges.'' `` We've got some problems, but they're not problems of human rights. I think the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should adhere to these high standards the president is talking about,'' said the vice president. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped questions about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s suggestion that Soviet bureaucracy, not <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy, was to blame for delays in issuing exit visas, or refusing them outright. He said he was pleased with the overall outcome of the summit, saying: `` I do n't think anyone expected a significant breakthrough'' on a new treaty. `` When I get back -LRB- to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- I'll get a much better inside assessemnt of what went on. But I think, generally speaking, it's been very positive,'' he said On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has `` great respect for the conservative movement'' and believes he has its support despite a public disagreement with two of its more outspoken members. One day earlier, in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview, he had taken aim at <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, a new right fund-raiser, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. He said in the interview, `` There's only one or two that polarize, and <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> are two of them.'' `` That's a longstanding feud with two individuals who do n't have any following,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday. `` The fact that I have been constantly attacked by two individuals does n't have anything to do with votes. If it did, I would n't be the likely nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in April. The vice president returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday after an eight-day sojourn at his vacation retreat, during which he met with domestic policy and economic advisers and held strategy sessions with top aides. Asked by a reporter if a `` new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' would emerge, he said: `` You're going to see a refurbished candidate because I come here and I feel good. I get a little bit rested. But you're not going to see any drastic change in campaign plans.'' Some Republican consultants have urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to put more distance between himself and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and to step up his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has moved a little bit in that direction in recent days, he told reporters: `` We've got a game plan. We're staying with it. It will be effective.'' He said he planned to hold most of his fire against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> until after the Democrats formally nominate their candidate. Then, he said, `` you will see me doing much more to put differences in focus. ... And that will be easy to do because we fundamentally differ on so many issues.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited reporters to his house to watch his 28-foot powerboat, `` Fidelity,'' get a safety check from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> auxiliary. It passed. He was presented an inspection sticker by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, chief of staff for the regional <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auxiliary </ORGANIZATION>, who noted that it was Safe Boating Week. Next, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a group of reporters for a boat ride as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials looked on. `` Should I make a dramatic exit?'' he asked. He gunned the two 185-horsepower engines on his modified Cigarette racing boat and turned the boat in a fast circle in the cove next to his dock, sending up a wall of spray, before rocketing out into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Was that a safe-boating manuever, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inspector, was asked by reporters? `` It's his cove,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> responded. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he `` learned a lot'' from economists who had briefed him on Tuesday and Wednesday. He want on to attack Democrats for `` pessimism and negativism'' about the economy.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said Thursday it will continue nuclear tests in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and rebuffed a Third World campaign for nuclear disarmament, saying that fighting poverty and hunger are just as important. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special session on disarmament not to adopt Utopian declarations on total nuclear disarmament. It called for realistic measures to reduce conventional arms, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and a ban on chemical weapons. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> told the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> it was paradoxical `` to lavish so much effort on disarmament talks while displaying only resignation and sometimes even indifference when tragic problems of poverty, hunger and debt are broached.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s minister of foreign affairs, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Quichen </PERSON>, congratulated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for recognizing their special responsibility to reduce their enormous nuclear arsenals, and on their treaty to scrap medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles He called on the superpowers to cut their arsenals further, while cautioning against false complacency: <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said that `` even if they do cut by half the number of their nuclear weapons, their nuclear arsenals will still account for approximately 90 percent of the world's total ... sufficient to destroy all life on earth many times over.'' He said `` people should be on guard against an important change which is taking place in the superpower arms race.'' Even with a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, he asked, `` will qualitative development of more and newer types of armaments make the world safer and peace more secure?'' President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> called again for demilitarization of his divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island, saying the money saved could promote economic development of Turkish Cypriots. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided into <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriot areas since <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded the island in 1974, saying it was to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority after a brief but unsuccessful coup there fostered by the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> military government then in power. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said `` no lasting solution is attainable unless Turkish occupation forces and settlers are withdrawn from the island.'' The special session meets through June 25. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its Western allies hope for a concrete, modest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> document on disarmament that will not impose on national defense policies and bilateral disarmament efforts. Most of the 12 speakers at the opening session Wednesday issued sweeping calls for total disarmament, a comprehensive nuclear test ban and a supervisory, verification and monitoring role for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is mainly opposed to the measures. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will not stop nuclear testing in the <ORGANIZATION> Mururoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> but announced that the government for the first time would make an annual statement on the number of tests in the preceding 12 months. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> refuses to ratify the Rarotonga Treaty instituting a nuclear-free zone in the region and <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> reaffirmed that decision.

 A former Franciscan monk serving an 18 - to 20-year prison term here for assault and battery has persuaded <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> to visit three of the state's prisons after corresponding with her for two years <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON>, 47, will be greeting <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> when the 77-year-old nun visits three state prisons, including <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION>, on Saturday. <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> said he invited <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> last year and he hopes she will spread `` the healing warmth of love'' among the inmates. `` <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> prison has been recognized as a holding pen for the lowest of the low,'' said <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> at a prison news conference Thursday afternoon. `` But every now and then a ray of hope shines. I hope this Saturday a ray of hope will shine when a little nun from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> comes.'' <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> inmates will present <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> with a pen drawing of her against a background of a comment she once made: `` We are like a pencil in God's hands, even though the instrument is imperfect, the writing is beautiful.'' The unlikely acquaintance of <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> and the Nobel Peace Prize winner began in 1986 when <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON>, encouraged by a prison chaplain and a nun in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, decided to write to her. Since then, he has written to her and has received four letters from her. <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON>, who grew up in the working-class western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Sacred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>, he became a Capuchine Franciscan monk and joined the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, as a lay brother. After four years in the monastery, <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> left. He said he's still not sure why he decided to leave `` It was springtime and the birds were singing and I wanted to live the good life,'' said <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON>, addressing reporters with the aplomb of a celebrity accustomed to the spotlight. `` Little did I know the good life would lead to the good life behind bars.'' In 1965, a few years after leaving the monastery, <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> was convicted of aggravated assault. He served nine years at <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> before his release in 1974, then returned to western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and held odd jobs, mostly as a cook. Around 1985, he said, he was arrested for four separate incidents of aggravated assault. <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> said he assaulted both a man and a woman in the course of the incidents, but he did not provide any details. `` That's not the issue,'' he said. `` What's here and now is the issue. I have nothing, no life in the streets. My life is in here.'' <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION>, properly known as the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution-Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION>, is the state's only maximum-security prison and is known as a tough institution. But <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> says he likes prison life and does n't want to leave. Though he is eligible for parole in 10 years, <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> said he would prefer to stay inside, describing himself as an `` old-time con, part of the furniture here.'' He said he even likes the food. `` I prefer it here, there's security, I do n't have to pay rent, do n't have to pay for lights,'' he said. `` I'm comfortable here.'' <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> said he plans to continue his correspondence with <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> after her visit, adding that it has `` broadened'' his outlook. He hopes his fellow inmates will have the same experience when they meet her Saturday. `` We are poor in spirit, poor in emotion and poor in material possessions but in the eyes of our Father we have a great dignity,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police Make Campus Arrests Following Clashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot police in armored vehicles swept onto a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> university campus Wednesday and arrested about 100 people protesting the death of a campus demonstrator, officials said. Earlier, police fired buckshot and tear gas to disperse students, some wearing masks and shouting leftist guerrilla slogans, who lobbed dynamite sticks at police and burned bonfires in nearby streets, according to reporters on the scene. Demonstration leaders at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, about four miles west of downtown, told reporters that six students were wounded by buckshot. Police said the Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group fomented the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> violence, but refused to confirm the reports of injury. Violent demonstrations also erupted at two universities downtown. Tear gas fired by police wafted through the city during evening rush hour, forcing thousands of pedestrians to cover their faces or seek shelter. The campus strife, which began Monday to protest the alleged killing of highland peasants by soldiers and against recent fee increases, intensified Wednesday, a day after a student was slain. Protest supporters charge the student was killed by a tear gas cannister fired by police. Officials have not confirmed the cause of the death. Demonstrations, held throughout the day, culminated late Wednesday afternoon as dozens of heavily-armed police, in five armored vehicles and in vans, rolled into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, police said. Officials said 100 university protesters were arrested, among them students in the campus cafeteria. Television news reports showed footage of police smashing a life-sized campus statue of Ernesto `` Che'' <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>, the deceased hero of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s Marxist revolution. It was the second time in 16 months that police entered the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> campus, which the government charges serves as a planning site for small pockets of leftist guerrillas. University campuses in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, as elsewhere in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, are considered autonomous and traditionally off limits to government forces. A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> police raid in February 1987, during which about 800 students were briefly arrested, sparked intense criticism by left-wing politicians against the government.

 The state Medicaid program offered free condoms to its clients for the first time Wednesday, but an unscientific survey of pharmacies found there were few takers. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is allowing Medicaid recipients to receive up to 24 free condoms at a time from pharmacies in an effort to promote birth control and curb the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

 Israeli human rights activists accuse their nation's soldiers of systematic brutality in the occupied lands and say such tactics are prolonging the six-month-old Palestinian uprising. In one case, an Arab resident of this isolated village said soldiers pelted him with rocks for two hours last month as he sat handcuffed in a pit. Two hand-sized spots of dried blood were visible in the pit several days later. In another village, Arabs alleged troops forced them to remove roadblocks as they tried to evacuate a 15-year-old shot by soldiers in a clash _ intentionally wasting crucial minutes of the boy's life The youth died the same day. In a third case, a 70-year-old man claimed troops threw him into a 12-foot-deep well in his garden and closed the lid. The man, who suffered sprained ankles and a fractured lower back, said he sat in two feet of cold water for six hours before being rescued. The army said initial investigations proved the allegations in all three cases to be unfounded, adding that soldiers were cleared of wrong-doing.

 The first Mormon missionaries to <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> were greeted by whole congregations of converts awaiting baptism into a church that for more than a century had refused to ordain blacks to its priesthood. `` They came to us,'' said former missionary <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>. `` We could have baptized thousands. They were living the gospel, paying tithing, holding meetings, before we arrived.'' When the late <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> ended the 130-year exclusion of blacks from the church's all-male priesthood on June 9, 1978, he paved the way for one of the most extraordinary episodes in the faith's long history of missionary work. Blacks have also converted by the thousands in many predominantly black <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries and in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where many of the church's 250,000 members claim black ancestors. But the story of Mormon growth in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> stands apart. For decades, thousands in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> who had read Mormon books and tracts implored the church to send missionaries to baptize them. But it was n't until the doctrine forbidding black priests was abolished that African governments would grant visas to Mormon missionaries. In one year, the first missionaries _ two elderly couples _ baptized nearly 2,000 converts. A decade later, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> has 8,500 church members, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> 5,000, with membership growing by about 4,000 a year in the two combined. Missionaries returning from African service tell of villagers walking more than 50 miles round trip to attend church meetings, of baptismal services lasting for hours to accommodate all the converts and communities where religion in general was of urgent concern. Church leaders assert they could multiply by many times the rate of growth in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if they wished. But they are moving slowly to build a solid base of black leadership, and they say the strategy is paying off. In May, visiting officials from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ordained the first black African stake president, a lay leader who presides over several congregations, in the Nigerian city of <LOCATION> Aba </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, controlled by the apartheid system of racial separation, the number of black converts is also on the rise. The church could not estimate their number because its membership records do not note race, but blacks attend Sunday meetings and worship in the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> alongside whites, said <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who supervises church activities in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Black Africans are aware of the church's old policy of denying priesthood membership to blacks, but it appears to have made little difference to them. `` They are not as interested in it as we are. For them, that's that They are grateful for -LRB- the change -RRB-, but their eyes are on the future and they do n't seem quite as caught up in it. It's not a big thing for them,'' said <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. Despite the success, prosyletizing in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has raised new challenges to a church long acquainted with missionary work in far-away places. Among the more difficult is the popular tradition of polygamy. Scores of potential converts have been denied baptism because of plural marriage, a practice the Mormons themselves once embraced but officially dropped in 1890 as a prerequisite to statehood for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabey </PERSON>, who led the first missionary contingent, said the problem arose on a grand scale in a congregation organized years before the missionaries arrived. When <PERSON> Mabey </PERSON> went to the village to baptize the people, he learned about half were polygamists. The monogamists initially refused to be baptized unless the others could be as well. But after meeting privately, local leaders decided that those who were monogamous would be baptized and the polygamists would continue to attend as non-members. A cultural barrier of a different type _ the practice of voodoo _ confronts missionaries in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>. A folk religion with African origins, voodoo involves the belief that the dead live in a spirit world from which they can be recalled to bless or curse the living. Those who practice it are refused baptism, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> congressman who now directs the church's missionary effort in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> King </PERSON> said adherents usually are not attracted to Mormonism. `` I rarely hear it discussed, although I'm aware it is very much a part of the Haitian culture,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` We can hear the voodoo drums going into the night.''

 <PERSON> Cleeretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> says she's `` free at last'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s new <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Second </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, but her 25-year-old son, a Sunday School teacher, wishes the church had more appeal for young blacks. A decade after the church began admitting blacks to priesthood, the sole urban Mormon congregation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which is 70 percent black, is mostly white and struggling to convert and keep black members. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> leaders could think of only two black families who attend church together. Most members are singles or couples and few stay in the ward long. The 400-member congregation is about 40 percent black, but at a recent Sunday service with 100 people, only about one-fourth were black. Yet officials of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints say some of the black members, particularly more-recent immigrants, are faithful members, and they are having a subtle impact on traditional Mormon services. A former <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> legislator, <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Olumba </PERSON>, teaches in his native `` agbada'' robes and headdress to a mostly white priesthood class. The lessons are out of the church manual, but <PERSON> Olumba </PERSON> adds unique phraseology and experience to Mormon doctrine. Mrs. <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>, the ward's public communications director, has heard the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. quoted in church. `` What this church has given me is such a high level of freedom. I'm free, I'm free at last in that ward,'' she said, consciously echoing <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s words. Mrs. <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>, whose husband left her and won custody of two of their four children after she joined the church three years before the ban on black priests was lifted, said she and other black Mormons tried for years to get an inner-city ward, which was finally established in May 1987. Before that, the city had been divided like a wagon wheel, with its wards radiating out into the suburbs along the lines of the spokes. That scattered the few black members among the suburban wards. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a Washington-based church spokeswoman, said the church earlier avoided having a city ward because it did n't want the appearance of segregating church members Now, although the gleaming Mormon temple in <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, is a suburban landmark, the city's Mormons have no chapel. On Sundays, the church leases part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, turning the modern downtown center into a not-so-typical Mormon wardhouse, with bishops conferences in a 13th-floor lounge overlooking the city, <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> classes in rooms named for famous journalists and sacrament services in a hall where the nation's newsmakers address the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> press. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> acknowledged the church faces a challenge in attracting black Americans. `` The gospel is ever true and ever the same. It does not change,'' she said. `` And yet, the people of other cultures must feel a spiritual and emotional binding with the spiritual message. That is sometimes missing.'' But in a church that now prides itself in attracting all races and nationalities, there are n't enough active black members to raise the issue of segregation. Mrs. <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> said the church has little appeal to inner-city blacks, who still view it as a white, racist institution. `` The church has the basic principles,'' he said, `` but it has to change with the times.'' A graduate in industrial technology, he said one of his major complaints about the church is the dullness of its music. At a recent service, the congregation sang several traditional, slow Mormon hymns _ a sharp contrast to the lively gospel music of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s predominantly black Protestant churches. A member of the bishopric, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, said he knew of no incidents of racial prejudice among Mormons in the area but pointed to other problems. Church members assigned to make monthly visits to members' homes have been mugged in tough inner-city neighborhoods, he said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> leaders try hard to make black members more active in the congregation and to make them leaders, he said, but many are from homes where they are the only Mormons. They face pressure to leave the church from their families and friends and from actively anti-Mormon Protestant ministers, he said. <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, a 26-year-old financial analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes full acceptance of the church by blacks may have to come with the generation who are now children. `` The children ... should be able to reconcile their black heritage and their Mormon heritage,'' he said. `` Maybe only then can there be a happy marriage of Mormonism and the black American.''

<HEAD>Town Survives On Planning, Good Fortune after 1,000-Job Pullout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREENCASTLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eighteen months ago when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> suddenly shut down its <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION> operation and took away nearly 1,000 jobs, it left behind a lot of `` ducks,'' local merchant <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> likes to say. `` Very calm on the surface, but paddling furiously underneath.'' That's how she describes the approach this quiet college town has taken from the day of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s bad news _ using careful planning, good fortune and hard work to bring in six new employers and 1,000 replacement jobs in the short term, as many as 2,000 five years from now. Long before <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would close its parts distribution center after 33 years, <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION> had laid the foundation to deal with the shock of losing 8 percent of the jobs in <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement without warning Nov. 11, 1986, and by the following March, about half of the employees had transferred to other sites, the rest had taken early retirement. `` The fact that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> closed could have been devastating. It was n't,'' said banker <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>. `` The framework was there, we were ready to go.'' In 1983 an economic development review had identified the strengths and weaknesses of the town of 8,400; the importance, for example, of revitalizing the courthouse square, which had just been designated a national historic district. A needed hotel, the Walden Inn, was planned for the edge of the <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. Two years later a planning group examined the town's economic future, leading to the incorporation of the <ORGANIZATION> Greencastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in September 1986. `` We were fortunate this community had started planning for the future three years ahead of time,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchings </PERSON>, chairman of the mayor's economic development commission. Despite an initial dark mood in town, residents projected only optimism to reporters who came to record the changes <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION> was going through. `` Everytime any media came around, the word would get around and the cheerleading would begin. I think that's what won all the industry,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who chairs the group that has led the rehabilitation of the Victorian buildings along the courthouse square. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, who helps the state recruit new industry through the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think they benefited from a lot of exposure when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> left and the legacy <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> left.'' No one has a harsh word for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The company gave $ 1.7 million to local government to smooth the transition of its loss and continued its <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> contribution of more than $ 120,000 for three years. It also turned over $ 700,000 from the sale of `` Big Blue,'' its 350,000-square-foot complex. Just as importantly, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> bought the more than 300 homes being sold by transferred employees and hired <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> to market them. Fewer than 10 remain unsold. Fortunate timing helped <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION>. Just days before the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announcement, bonds were sold for a $ 13 million expansion of the high school and construction of the middle school. A week later and the bonds might not have been sold. They've made the schools more attractive to companies scouting new locations. A day before the announcement, scouts for <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which produces auto trim, had been in the area discussing possible locations. A few days afterward, they were inspecting the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> site. That January, just 72 days after <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> became the first new industry to come to <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION> in 15 years. It built a plant under the <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> name that might employ as many 700 workers in five years. `` It was the boost we needed. It was a confirmation to our optimism,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greencastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Banker <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Doan </PERSON> recalled the time he and others were in his office after midnight negotiating with an officer from Charming Shoppes in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on one phone and one from <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> K.K </PERSON>. in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on another. Charming will move into `` Big Blue'' and employ 300 by early next year in a warehouse for its women's fashion outlets. More than 600 eventually might work there. <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON>, which like <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION> will supply auto trim to Japanese auto plants being built in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, will employ 100 in a company called <ORGANIZATION> Heartland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by the end of next year. Three other companies _ two automobile parts suppliers and <ORGANIZATION> Sherwin-Williams </ORGANIZATION>, which is setting up a distributing center for automotive paint _ also are developing facilities in an industrial park where once only <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> stood. The new companies, however, wo n't replace <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s payroll, which was $ 38 million, or roughly $ 38,000 per year per employee. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Andis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s former head of strategic planning who took early retirement to run the development center, said new employers will create an initial payroll of about $ 20 million. He and other retirees will bring in an additional $ 9 million in income. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, a local car dealer, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> people represented sales of at least a car per day for him. After <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> left, his volume has dropped from more than 80 cars per month to about 20. He laid off 19 of his 45 employees. The Rev. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s departure meant losing a fifth of his congregation of 216, plus 31 percent of the donations. But now his congregation is back over 200 again. `` The Lord was very gracious with us,'' <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmless </PERSON>, a 38-year-old <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION> native elected last November, points out the new industry will create entry-level jobs for local high-school graduates. But until all the companies get going, he acknowledges, `` these are going to be lean years for the community.''

 Professional surfer <PERSON> Rell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapoliokaehukai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON> figured she and her dog, <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, had the `` Wet Pet'' division of a recent surfing contest all wrapped up. Then the pig with the sunscreen showed up. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaulana </PERSON>, another pro surfer, and his 4-month-old pig `` Chop Chop'' sent the 2,000 spectators and five judges at <LOCATION> Makaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> hog wild, beating a dozen other human competitors who rode their boards tandem with everything from a baby goose to saltwater fish in a bowl. `` <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> is the surfing dog of <LOCATION> Makaha </LOCATION>, the kids love him,'' <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON> said of her 2-year-old mutt. `` But <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> really did some moves on the board with that pig, Chop Chop. <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> just sort of sits there.'' But <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON>, who is 37 and works as a lifeguard, said winning was not important. She was happy that the first `` Wet Pet'' contest, part of the 11th Annual <ORGANIZATION> Rell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Menehune </ORGANIZATION> Surfing Championships, was a hit. `` The kids out there were going crazy. Everybody just loved it,'' she said. Not everybody. The <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> received numerous phone calls protesting the event and wants to prevent similar contests in the future, according to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, public relations and fund development director. The society is not impressed by surfing animals. `` We are against putting animals in unnatural or dangerous situations,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` And there is nothing more unnatural than a pig on a surfboard.'' Further, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said, delicate pink pig skin is prone to sunburn, and not all owners are as considerate at <PERSON> Keaulana </PERSON>, who covered Chop Chop's ears and snout with multicolored zinc oxide. `` People thought the pig was in distress because it was green,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` They did n't know it was covered with colored suntan lotion.'' <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON>'s `` Wet Pet'' contest is the first one <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> has heard of in the islands, but he's worried the idea might catch on. `` It might look fun, but whose entertainment is it?'' he asked. `` It's certainly not entertaining or fun for the animals.'' <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON> disagreed, but acknowledged <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> had a point. `` <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> loves being in the water. He loves to surf and he loves the attention,'' she said. `` But some animals might not like it, and their owners should n't push them just to show off.'' <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON> said she refused to let one inexperienced surfer enter the `` Wet Pet'' competition after she saw the woman practicing with her dog. `` She wiped out and had attached the dog's leash to the board so it really got knocked around in the waves. That dog could have drowned or broken its neck,'' <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> `` is n't declaring war on these people, we just want to educate them,'' noting that animals are prohibited on state beaches, and that regulation could be more strictly enforced. <PERSON> Sunn </PERSON> said she plans to hold the competition again next year, but will regulate who can enter. `` We're only going to have people who we know surf with their animals, who we've seen out before,'' she said. Meanwhile, she says she'll keep surfing with <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>. `` He loves it and I do n't think anybody should tell me what to do with my dog,'' she said. `` I do n't force him. I just put the board on the beach, he jumps on the nose and we paddle out together.'' `` I only take him out in gentle surf. He likes small waves, nothing bigger than 5 feet.'' <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> agreed: `` You know how certain dogs really like to hang their heads out of car windows? Well, it's like that, some pets just really take to the waves.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> owns <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION>, a Honolulu-based water sports equipment and clothing store with nationwide distribution, which sponsored a surfing contest in the waves off <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> on Memorial Day and wanted to include a `` Wet Pet'' division this year. `` I've heard of pigs out in Waianae that bodysurf all by themselves and one gal has a pet rabbit that follows her to the beach,'' he said. But after talking it over with the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> scrapped his plan. `` They let us know they were against it and that is was illegal to have animals on the beach,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` It looked like it was going to cause a big stink, when it was supposed to be all in fun, so we just decided to drop it.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> `` was very sensible about it and understood our point of view,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. `` Some people are n't so sensible. Those are the ones we're worried about.''

 <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s `` A Prairie Home Companion: The Second Annual Farewell Performance'' comes to cable viewers Saturday from that most cosmopolitan of places, Radio City Music Hall. The setting is symbolic of <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s new life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. After 13 years of radio shows, several television appearances and two best-sellers filled with wry tales from the quintessential small Midwestern town, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said in a recent interview that <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wobegon </LOCATION>, as well as real-life <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, had become part of the past. <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> ended the radio show last year with a farewell performance in <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, then left his life-long home to move to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> with his Danish wife. But he soon wearied of being a stranger in a strange land and returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, this time to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wobegon </LOCATION> is really my childhood and it does not, it is n't, perhaps I'm supposed to walk away from it at some point and leave it,'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said somewhat sadly over Italian food near his Chelsea apartment. `` I went back to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. I've been back twice since I left there last fall, and realized both times that ... it's not my home Strange feeling. Not pleasant.'' Though his Saturday evening public radio show was popular, fame really descended upon <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> after publication of his 1985 best-seller, `` Lake Wobegon Days.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said, `` I think that our life is, if anything, more domestic than it was in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, and much quieter and much more private. Some people might go to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for peace and stability, but life in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was crazy, and life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is eminently sane.'' Saturday's broadcast, after two non-broadcast performances, will be available on a number of cable systems offering a free sample of The Disney Channel. The performance will also be carried live on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s guests include <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Everly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. Leaving Lake Wobegon does n't mean an end to the folksy stories and dry wit that have made <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> famous. They'll just move to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` There are a lot of people like me in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said. `` Midwestern people, church-going people, not that I set church-going people aside as a separate class, but white, sort of unremarkably liberal, ordinary people who enjoy all of the fascinations and foreignness of the city and the excitement without themselves being changed so much. ... I think I could talk about those people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' Such adventures might turn up on radio in the not-too-distant future, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said. `` I think that I owe myself two years' sabbatical, and it's half up. But I really feel that, -LRB- since -RRB- I did the show for 13 years at the biblical rate of one per seven, I'm entitled to a year and 10 months or something. Then I could decide on it. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is our home for as far ahead as I can see.'' More television is also likely. There have been network people `` who want to have lunch sometime,'' he said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> writes for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine and is working on a movie script at the urging of director <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>. His books, `` Lake Wobegon Days'' and `` Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories,'' both became best-sellers. Although in appearances on public television and previously on The <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> proved himself a natural for television, he says he has n't gotten used to seeing himself on the small screen. `` If I had guests, they'd sometimes turn it on, and I'd stand and watch part of it, but when I came on the screen I always felt unbearable and went and cooked something,'' he said. Perhaps inspired by his recent appearance in the gala honoring <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on his 100th birthday, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s Radio City Music Hall performance will feature a production-number monologue involving the rotating stage. While <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> is lifted, lowered and turned around, the radio audience is to be none the wiser. `` I'll be talking about something all this time that does n't have anything to do with the house, the stage, television,'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said `` I was hoping to disappear, as an illusion trick. I did n't know quite how to do that on radio.''

 Avant-garde artists armed with video cameras rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art designed to draw the viewer into the picture. `` People are captivated by this art form,'' said video artist <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON>. `` It screens out distractions. It draws you into a completely new and different world. In that sense, it's kind of like going to the movies.'' A new exhibit, `` American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove,'' features work done in the past decade by seven leading video artists, including <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON>. The show, on display through July 10 at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, features bright moving images that appear on video monitors illuminating darkened rooms. The videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds call, a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging amid crackles and pops. Eerie music plays as the camera peers up the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water. The artists placed rocks, trees and other objects around the video monitors, which have screens up to 25 inches wide. In one work, viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own images in the still water of a reflecting pool. In another, a coil periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream. `` Each space creates its own environment,'' <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON> says. `` The impact, I think, is greater than sculpture. There is the sound as well as moving images and three dimensional objects.'' Many people resist the concept of video art, assuming viewing it would be like watching television, but they usually like the works once they see them, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Judson </PERSON>, film curator at the Carnegie. `` People come in and they see this and they say, ` My God, I love that,''' he said. `` They're astonished in themselves.'' Video art began in the mid-1960s, when advances in technology made black and white film equipment more affordable. In the early'70s, museums began showing elaborate video displays, and some artists used color computer-generated images in their work. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> have displayed video works, but many smaller museums ca n't afford the high cost of building the exhibits, <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of great work being done, but it's just not getting exposure,'' he said. In <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON>'s `` Wilderness,'' three videotapes are shown simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals. She filmed the same sites depicted by 19th century American landscape artists such as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Church </PERSON>, showing gleaming icebergs against a backdrop of clear sky. One work, `` Room for St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>,'' has a gyrating image of mountain tops projected on a large screen. In the center of the room is a small cube with light streaming from a single window. A voice reciting in Spanish can be heard, and a white-capped mountain is shown on a small video monitor inside the cube. Artist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> said the work is based on a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> mystic who wrote love poetry and dreamed of flying over mountains despite being confined and tortured for nine months in a cell. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s `` The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described,'' features six monitors and a large screen that show a roaring fire, tornadoes whirling and storms at sea. Within the gallery, a steel fence encloses the coil that fires an electrical discharge at two oversized, stainless steel high-backed chairs. In `` The Allure of the Concentric'' by <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, four monitors amid large volcanic rocks show closeup views of leaves and weeds, dry cracked ground and the silhouette of stark tree trunks against sky. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON> placed eight eye-level monitors in a square, showing reeds in a marsh, birds flying and other wildlife in the wilderness north of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Around the corner, the viewer stands in the center of a ring of eight monitors showing natural and colorized images that <PERSON> Steina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasulka </PERSON> created of New Mexican mountains and the desert. In <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON>'s `` Will-O' - The Wisp,'' three monitors placed in a panel show a woman amidst trees as a woman's voice speaks about a

 He's hobnobbed with <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, and touted the talents of a budding actor named <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON> counts as his greatest coup resurrecting the career of an 80-year-old out-of-work comic named <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` I've been lucky,'' <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said during a recent interview at <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, his longtime friend and client, was appearing. `` I've been able to work with the best of them. And I've been in a position to turn away the tough ones who spell trouble. Fein recites a long list of famous stars he's promoted since he entered the publicity field via a short story contest at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> more than half a century ago. The names include <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. He says working with those great names of another era is a different world from today's stars, many of whom have egos to match stratosphere salaries. `` These young kids, making $ 5 million a year, they think they're giants and suddenly they're monsters,'' <PERSON> Fein </PERSON> said `` Some of these young stars are impossible, with 18 hangers-on, managers, agents, etc. `` I've been very lucky. <PERSON> George </PERSON> is very easy to deal with; he's a professional. You get ready to go to the plane and he's half an hour early. He gets to the dressing room an hour or hour and a half before the opening act. `` Jack -LRB- <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> -RRB- was the same way. He was always ready. I'd pick him up to go to the airport and he'd be waiting out in front of his house with his bags. `` Some of these new stars are terrible,'' Fein said. `` You pull up and they're still sleeping. You make the plane just as the doors are closing.'' What makes the difference? `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> were old pros,'' he said. `` They came up the hard way, started small time in vaudeville, had tough breaks, tough jobs.'' Fein remembers another era, as a publicity executive at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, when it was easier to work with stars. `` At <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> we'd hire 20 young people a year, sign them up at $ 75 a week,'' he recalled. `` <LOCATION> Hayworth </LOCATION>, -LRB- Ann -RRB- <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, they all started that way. They had six-month options. Their salaries would jump from $ 75 a week to $ 100, then $ 125, $ 150. Those young kids were so eager, so cooperative. They'd do anything to work with you. They used to plead with us to do that publicity stuff.'' Fein was <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s manager in 1974 when the famous comic contracted cancer. Fein had landed <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> the lead role in `` The Sunshine Boys'' with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthau </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> died Dec. 26, 1974, at the age of 80. Fein had worked with <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> 27 years, winning an Emmy for production work on his show. In the last decade of <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s life, it was Fein who produced his TV specials and set up benefit concerts that took the two across the country and around the world. Fein was left with some poignant memories. `` He was such a vibrant guy _ warm, sweet, honest, decent.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said he came up with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s best friend _ as the replacement for the `` Sunshine'' role. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> won an Academy Award for his performance and his second career _ at age 80 _ was off and rolling. Today <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is the author of several books, performs regularly at <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, has starred in several movies and has been the host of several TV specials. It was a different story in 1974. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s career had gone way down since Gracie -LRB- <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> -RRB- died in 1964,'' Fein recalled. `` He worked very little. Once in a while he would do spots for us -LRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s TV show -RRB-. <PERSON> George </PERSON> was very unhappy.'' When Fein learned <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> was dying, he told the film's producers <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> could fill the void. `` Every star was after that job,'' Fein recalled. `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>, a million people were after that job. But I got it for <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' After `` Sunshine Boys'' was completed, Fein booked <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, then <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In the past 14 years with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, Fein has produced several movies starring his friend -LRB- `` You and Me Kid,'' `` Oh God, You Devil,'' `` 18 Again'' -RRB- and is working on `` Oh God IV.'' He has written the book, `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> _ An Intimate Biography,'' and worked with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> on books such as `` Living It Up _ Will They Still Love Me in <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>,'' and the upcoming book, `` <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> _ A Love Story,'' which is due out in October. Fein planned to be a lawyer when he went to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>. But he won a short story contest, which landed him a job in the publicity department at <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION>. He worked 18 hour days to continue his PR job and earn a law degree. His first love remained the stars he promoted. After getting dozens of stars tons of ink, he's focusing today only on Burns. And he has n't lost the knack of answering _ or avoiding a question. How old is he? `` Early 70s,'' Fein says. `` How early?'' `` Just early,'' he grins.

<HEAD>Christians Flock To Atheist Land To Salute Faith</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 By some odd twists of place and history, church leaders of the world converge next week in a land of official atheism to celebrate the original flowering there of Christianity. It's a peculiar combination. In the seemingly incompatible setting of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whose government disavows existence of God, an enduring faith marks its 1,000 th birthday Taking part there in June 5-16 celebrations are prominent church figures from many countries, ranging from top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officers to evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> to the Archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>. To a curious extent, the occasion brings together chieftains of belief in a climate against it, where the Communist government's efforts to stamp it out have gone on for 70 years But signs of change circulated and the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigdon </PERSON>, a Presbyterian scholar of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and specialist on Soviet church life, says `` all kinds of amazing things are happening'' to improve religious conditions. `` We want to show our solidarity with churches there, to express our hopes for them and let the government know that they're not isolated and alone but part of a worldwide community that holds them in esteem and cares for them.'' The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also among those attending, says, `` This worldwide gathering can be helpful in overcoming barriers to Christianity and making it better understood.'' The affair comes at a time of moderations in Soviet domestic policies, including opening of additional churches, large-scale printing and importing of Bibles and promised easing of religious restrictions. Some even see latent religious potentialities in Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, reportedly raised in a Russian Orthodox family and who says laws are being revised to recognize religious concerns. `` We are praying that he will become a Christian and, if possible, a Methodist,'' the Rev. Olay Parnaments, a <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> pastor in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> general conference in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in May. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in April met with Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and called for more tolerant attitudes toward religion, the first such meeting between top church and government leaders in 40 years. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative of Russian Orthodoxy, says about 450 foreign church leaders are attending the celebrations there, including about 60 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Roman Cathoilicism is sending a high-level, 10-member delegation, headed by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s top aide. He and Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, leader of the world-wide Anglican communion, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians, are among speakers for special `` Jubilee'' ceremonies June 10 at Resurrection Church of the newly restored St. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Monastery </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Other speakers at that time are to include <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and Rabbi <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, president of the interfaith <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conscience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which works internationally to promote religious freedom. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> issued a pastoral letter on the rise and endurance of Christianity in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, expressing hopes for `` full communion in Christ with these sister churches.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> hailed the Russian church for its creative influence in the country's history. Among American church leaders attending: The Rev. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> Arie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>; Metropolitan Theodosius, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; Episcopal Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; Presbyterian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of the World Conference on Religion and Peace; <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, president of Seventh-day Adventists, and the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, general secretary of the Church of the Brethren. The 10-day celebration starts with all-night vigils at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> churches, followed the next day, June 5, by a liturgy at the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Epiphany led by Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>. Russian Orthodoxy holds a council June 6-9 at the nearby theological center at <LOCATION> Zagorsk </LOCATION>, with various intervening events at theaters and churches prior to the `` Jubilee'' ceremonies June l0. Another all-night vigil was set June ll at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> churches. Other special services commemorating saints, and recognizing some new ones, were set for June 12 in Trinity Cathedral, with a reception afterward, hosted by <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> and other Orthodox prelates. On following days, and also interspersing previous events, visits were to be made to churches in other cities, including <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>. It was in A.D. 988 that <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>, newly converted to Christianity, got the pagan subjects of his principality then known as <PERSON> Kievan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rus </PERSON> to join in a mass baptism of thousands in the Dnieper river at <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. The faith penetrated a people and a culture, and despite hardships it has encountered, the imprint remains.

 Cole <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> has known for two years that when the big earthquake hits <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, it will be his job to get <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> back into business. When the city's worst high-rise fire swept the bank's headquarters last month, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> saw his disaster plans put to the test, and by all accounts, they passed The inferno broke out at 10:30 p.m. May 4, gutting 4 -LCB- floors of the 62-story building, killing one maintenance man and closing the state's tallest building for an indefinite time. But by the start of banking hours the next day, the vital business of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's ninth-biggest bank holding company, was proceeding And only one of the company's 320 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> branches was closed _ the one on the building's ground floor. `` Because of the planning process, because of the group of people that was there, the team, and our instant communications with our customers, we did n't miss a beat,'' said <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, the bank's vice president for information management. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, 42, is in charge of contingency planning and computer security. He is assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, although in the headquarters fire, his plan and staff also helped restart the parent company, which owns banks in 13 states and franchises in 10 others. A former criminal investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> moved into corporate security in 1977. He began his tenure at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 after stints with various other firms including <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. His straightforward, almost deadpan description of First Interstate's recovery from the fire is typical of his lawman's approach to the task of disaster He recalled that shortly after the fire broke out, his five-member `` business resumption group'' and a parallel group that deals with staff safety opened the bank's new emergency center, which is in a computer operations building seven blocks from the downtown headquarters. As damage reports came in, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>'s group orchestrated moves for the vital groups that work in the headquarters: _ They saw the securities trading department dispersed, with traders flying to company offices in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as well as taking borrowed space in town They were prepared, since the disaster plan calls for traders and a few other key employees to carry home diskettes bearing vital records from their personal computers. _ They arranged the rental of hundreds of telephones, switched numbers and lines, and organized the flow of 125,000 incoming and 8,000 outgoing pieces of mail each day _ As the week wore on, they found office space for 1,500 displaced workers in First Interstate buildings and branches throughout <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in offices rented or borrowed on short notice The main computers handling the bank's daily rush of consumer and business transactions were n't in the headquarters, but if they had been knocked out, they would have been backed up in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> noted. `` Those in banking that were aware of First Interstate's -LRB- disaster -RRB- plan said that it was among the best in the industry,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` Cole is a very well-organized person, a very non-excitable type person,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistey </PERSON>, a co-worker in charge of the bank's physical security `` That's something that's very important in any crisis ... And if your planning has gone well, that's something that's not all facade.'' <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinola </PERSON>, chairman of the holding company, credits planners with foreseeing the necessary moves, but, like <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, praises the employees who made the plans work and continue to work in sometimes cramped quarters. `` I think the heroes are there,'' <PERSON> Pinola </PERSON> said, `` -LRB- but -RRB- in this case every single member of the organization feels good about their part in getting us out of this mess.'' The disaster plan actually was developed to deal with a great earthquake. The state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> say odds are better than 50 percent that such a quake will hit the region in the next 25 years. `` An earthquake is real, and it's catastrophic, and it's going to happen,'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said. `` There's nobody in my position in any of the banks who's going to say ` if.' It's always ` when it's going to happen.' I feel even more confident right now that we're well on the way to being prepared for that.'' In <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>'s office, a hardhat hangs from the coatrack and a portable telephone sits on a chair. The view out the window is of a white circus tent pitched to shelter hundreds of cardboard cartons holding business documents and personal belongings salvaged from the building. Preliminary engineering reports indicate the building will be safe to reoccupy, but <PERSON> Pinola </PERSON> says estimates of when are guesses at best. An electrical fault is believed to have caused the fire, but the investigation is n't complete. There still is n't a firm dollar estimate of the damage. For <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> and his team, the recovery is both a victory and a base on which to build. `` It's funny, it's almost addictive _ planning alternates,'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said. `` Even planning a trip you find yourself saying, ` If I ca n't go this way and catch this plane at this schedule, then I have this back-up.' It just becomes a normal part of your thinking.''

<HEAD>Capitalism Visits Communism for Superpower Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From Cajun food to cable television, the journalists, Kremlinologists, presidential aides and party functionaries involved in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit got a glimpse of capitalism in the core of communist power. While the summit was short on substance, it broke down some of the stereotypes the two leaders had on life in the other superpower, stirring up a `` feel-good'' atmosphere that was visible on the streets and sidewalks of this infamously grim city. Media madness and commercial hype are unfamiliar experiences in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and for the most part Soviet citizens were excluded from the fray that unfolded at the summit media center. Roadblocks set up a half-mile from the site at the International Hotel steered away all without special passes. But for the Westerners in town for the meetings between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a few touches of home made their stay more comfortable and in conformance with similar events held abroad. The island of consumerism established at the hotel, known as the `` Mezh'' among the foreign community here, drew dozens of prominent Soviet pundits and politicians. Instant coffee and caviar sandwiches were sold from linen-spread tables in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, alongside kiosks selling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s book `` Perestroika'' and stacks of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> postcards Officials in the vanguard of the glasnost and perestroika campaigns milled around the cavernous press room, where many of the 5,000 journalists covering the event set up telephones, typewriters and portable computers. They gave impromptu interviews, surveyed the souvenirs and watched the live <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> feed on huge television monitors set up throughout the center. The White House press center issued texts of the president's speeches and comments, and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> responded with summit briefing packets and a desk that took applications for private interviews with Soviet officials <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> beamed its 24-hour service into central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the summit, but only foreign-made televisions like those at the <LOCATION> Mezh </LOCATION> were able to tune in the American programming. A mobile pizza van brought in to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> two months ago parked along the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> embankment across from the hotel and did a whopping business with the busy journalists. A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> chef, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>, shipped his Cajun cooking operation _ lock, stock and catfish _ to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the summit, taking over the Mercury restaurant at the Mezh in a weeklong joint-venture that hit some snags. The restaurant gave out free hamburgers and fries to the working press as a means of eating up some of its profits that could not be taken out of the country. Rival T-shirt and souvenir kiosks sprung up at the press center, dispensing `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Summit-88'' memorabilia for hard currency. Even the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency got in on the act, producing shirts, buttons, records and tapes with the help of an American marketing firm. Summit spinoffs that reached the general public were at times more hindrance than help. Roadblocks were set up at intersections leading to all summit sights _ the press center, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's residence where the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> stayed and along motorcade routes. The traffic diversions frustrated some Soviets trying to get to home or work in areas around the president's path. But the spruced-up city and the excitement of a visit by the American president who once called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire'' made Muscovites proud and brought them out in droves for walks about the summit showcase. American and Soviet flags stemmed from light poles along the motorcade routes and Red Square, with its famous and garish landmarks, was floodlit throughout the summit for the benefit of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> television viewers who saw the historic setting as the backdrop on evening news programs. The Arbat pedestrian mall, always thronged with street artists and strollers, took on a more political focus with murals depicting abstract concepts of superpower relations and buttons commemorating the five-day event. But almost simultaneously with the takeoff of the presidential plane, the barriers came down and the power plugs were pulled. Some summit preparations may have longer term effects, like the frenetic painting and repaving done before the event. But for most Muscovites, the signs of the superpower conference were a memory before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plane crossed out of Soviet airspace.

 An 18th century tavern with trees sprouting through the floorboards seemed destined to be razed in a firefighting drill until it was rescued by a couple of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> developers who look to the past to find fancy homes for the future. Now it will be restored, with modern conveniences added, and become one of the dozen or so antique homes in an unusual 33-acre subdivision in this affluent town on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Developers <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> are scouring the countryside for other vintage homes for the subdivision they call Sterling Meadows. The homes, when finished, will carry a modern price tag of $ 800,000 to $ 1.2 million. Broom and <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> say they have n't tried to sell any yet. The former owner of the old tavern, they said, sold it to them rather than to the Salem fire department, which was going to burn it down for a firefighting drill. `` The problem is most old houses are accidents of geography,'' says <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, 32, of <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, who left a career in finance more than two years ago to become a developer. `` What used to be a convenient location on the main road is now a busy commercial district with a lot of traffic going by and they end up being torn down for a new office building, a new apartment building or one thing or another.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says the partnership has purchased five buildings for its subdivision and is still looking for others to fill the seven other lots. Four buildings are now being reconstructed at the site. A concrete foundation is ready for a federal-style home from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that dates to around 1800. They expect to complete the development in about three years. The first step is saving the buildings, a painstaking task. The partnership has paid $ 5,000 to $ 20,000 for the relics and spends five to six weeks dismantling them. With a crew of carpenters supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION>'s other business, H.B. <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housewright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a restoration company, nearly everything is saved from frame and windows to mantels and floorboards. Broom and <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> remain true to each building's original design _ which means, for example, rebuilding six fireplaces in the former <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> tavern _ but the structures are outfitted with modern conveniences such as burglar alarm systems and central air conditioning. `` When we rebuild these houses, we're using all the original features and restoring the house as best we can, but we're not building museums,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION>, 44, of Lyme, whose office is in a building built in 1770 to serve as a general store for steamships on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the ferry that to this day shuttles between <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hadlyme </LOCATION>. `` We're building houses that are practical to live in.'' The interiors are slightly modified with ells to accommodate the modern trappings of kitchens and bathrooms. Otherwise the homes are original, right down to the slightly off-center front doors on some. They plan to pave the winding road leading to the development and line it with sugar maples, stone walls and picket fences. Antique lampposts will be re-created, based on design borrowed from <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` We're trying to create the perfect <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> environment,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says. `` We try not to change the details at all and take small liberties with the ells.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> is quick to dispel notions that the developers are trying to imitate <LOCATION> Sturbridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He says they confine their efforts to homes built between 1700 and 1815 and lean toward those in formal styles, such as federal or Georgian. Similar but smaller subdivisions of five relocated historic homes each are located in rural <LOCATION> Killingworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Waitsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> criticizes the so-called `` purist'' approach to restoration, which is light on modern conveniences and heavy on dark interior colors `` The result when a so-called purist restores a house is that the houses tend to be dark and use dark colors and that is not quite what everybody would like,'' he says. The Sterling Meadows development has met the approval of town officials, who are committed to 2 - and 3-acre zoning in order to preserve the town's atmosphere About 1,910 people live in Lyme's 33 square miles. Homeowners include former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>. `` If you're gon na have development of that nature, you could do no better than <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broom </PERSON>,'' says Lyme First Selectman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeomans </PERSON>, referring to Broom by his nickname. `` They're as good as any and better than most.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> and Broom formed their partnership 2 -LCB- years ago after <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> bought a tract of land alongside a 12-acre parcel Broom already owned. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says he has had a lifelong interest in antique homes while Broom quit a job as an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> about 15 years ago to start his restoration business. `` I had a piece of land I bought as a investment and I always wanted to put antique houses on it,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION>, whose company has restored about 80 homes. `` Oddly enough, he wanted to do the same thing.''

 The 1989 Ford Probe can be hazardous to drive. The problem is not with the car, but with other folks who want to get a good look at it. During the time I had a Probe GL test car, I was chased at 80 mph down a freeway by two guys in a spanking new-looking Pontiac Grand Prix who wanted to check out the Probe. Their Grand Prix just made its debut this model year. I also encountered an older fellow who nearly stopped in the middle of intersection so he could get a gander at my Probe. Traffic in my neighborhood picked up one Sunday as people came back around the block to get second and third looks at the Probe. And the Probe was immediately surrounded by curious sales people at a <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> dealership I visited. It sure seems that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has an attention-getter with this aerodynamic, fun-to-drive, small specialty car that was unveiled in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in February and went on sale in May. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> already has 70,000 orders, which amounts to this year's full production at the <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, plant where the car is built. Eventual plant capacity could reach 150,000 annually. The front-drive Probe is unique in a couple ways. Though sold in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> showrooms, the car was designed with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and is being produced at the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> plant in Flat Rock by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members. The plant, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plant operated by a Japanese automaker to be organized by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, also builds the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> version of the Probe, called the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX-6 which shares many components with the Probe. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, by the way, owns 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. But the Probe differs from the MX-6 in appearance inside and out, conveying a more modern, sleek image. And for all the attention it gets, it does n't cost a mint. Base price for the GL, the lowest-priced version of the Probe, was $ 10,459. The test car, with optional premium sound system, cast aluminum wheels, air conditioning and automatic transmission totaled $ 13,186. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also offers an upscale LX model which starts at around $ 11,400, and a top-of-the-line performance GT, which sports a spoiler, fog lamps and turbocharged engine and starts at around $ 13,600. Those prices put the Probe squarely in contention with its Japanese competitors _ the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Prelude, which starts around $ 14,000, and the Toyota Celica, which starts around $ 12,000. The test car, the low-end Probe GL, had commendable suspension and good handling. However, the standard engine _ a 2.2-liter electronic fuel-injected four-cylinder _ did n't quite seem to deliver the power one would want in such a sleek, sassy-looking car. Cloth front bucket seats were comfortable enough. But leg room in the back was a problem. Fit and finish inside and out was admirable, and the tilt steering was different, causing the whole steering module, including instrument cluster, to move up and down. It was a nice touch, considering the feature meant never having to worry about a steering wheel adjustment obscuring the view of one of the gauges. It took some getting used to the blinker. It was n't a stalk on the side of the steering column. Rather, it was a small lever attached to the dash. Likewise, the headlights were not activated by the traditional push-pull knob on the dash nor the turn of a switch at the end of a blinker stalk. Instead, the retractable headlights came out and on when a large dial on the side of the instrument cluster was turned. The rear cargo area was deep and roomy, but items had to be lifted up and over the rear of the car. The Probe is aimed at young, career-oriented buyers, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Specifically, targeted buyers have a median age of 30, 55 percent are single, half are male, and they have a median annual income of $ 33,000, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON>. The major occupations expected to be represented among Probe drivers include professional-technical workers and managers, he added. There have been several reports that the Probe is designed to replace the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION>, which has been around since the 1960s. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> says the two cars will be sold side-by-side in showrooms, and the <PERSON> Mustang </PERSON> will remain as long as there is consumer demand. Because the Probe is just arriving on the market, there are no reliability reports.

 For <PERSON> Felton </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hooperman,'' being an actor has meant putting a lot of handcuffs on people _ when he was n't wearing them himself. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> plays gruff Inspector <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> comedy starring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> as <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooperman </PERSON>, a plainclothes <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciso </LOCATION> police officer. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> was also a police lieutenant in a recurring role on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION> Law.'' He was Dirty Harry's partner in the movie `` <ORGANIZATION> Magnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' In `` Walking Tall,'' he was a deputy sheriff. He was a prison warden in `` Weeds'' and a policeman in several TV pilots. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> also spent considerable time playing men on the other side of the law. He was the terrorist who kidnaped <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> in `` Get <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>.'' He was a villain in `` Stingray,'' a vicious drug dealer on `` Hill Street Blues'' and a criminal on `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>.'' `` People see me either as a cop or a crook,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>. `` I spend a lot of time putting on handcuffs or wearing them. Or saying ` Freeze!' or throwing my hands up.'' On `` Hooperman,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said, `` I'm like <PERSON> Hooperman </PERSON>'s best friend on the show. He's a guy he can level with. A guy who looks to him and says, ` What's next?' They go out on cases together, but <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> goes out with everyone.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosson </PERSON> plays Capt. C.Z. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who runs the department, and the name describes her authoritarian approach. `` She sees through all of us,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` We've all been on the carpet for the chances we took. Under <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s guidance, of course.'' Last season, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had a recurring role as police Lt. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> in `` L.A. Law'' in the episodes in which <PERSON> Alfre </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON>, who won an Emmy for her performance, played a leukemia victim who was raped and made to seem the aggressor at the trial. His only other series was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' a short-lived 1970 show about a hotline for troubled teen-agers. It starred <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. In recent years, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> has devoted most of his time to television and theatrical motion pictures and occasional guest roles on TV. `` In ` Robocop' I got to play a character I've never played before,'' he said. `` I did n't play a cop. Fortunately, the director was Dutch and did n't have a strong Hollywood connection and I'd known the producer for years I played a member of the management team that controls ` Robocop.' `` I'm this wimp, a yes-man who agrees with everyone. As it turns out, I'm one of the few people to survive and I become the No. 2 man in the management team. That role helped people see me differently.'' He just completed a role as a psychiatric therapist in the movie comedy `` Checking Out.'' He counsels <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> about dying, then promptly dies himself. That's not the end of his role in the film, however. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> also recently closed an eight-week run of the play `` An American Tract,'' which he produced. He's also the author of a play called `` Or,'' about wounded <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in a special rehabilitation ward of a Veterans hospital, plus two other plays, `` by the bi and bye'' and `` Sleep No More.'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and quit school to join the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> when he was 17. His fluency in Spanish landed him a job as an interpreter while stationed in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. He also spent time in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He obtained his high school diploma while in the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, and afterward got his degree at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. While in college he was on the judo team and qualified for the 1964 Olympics tryouts. `` I really started performing when I was 2,'' he said. `` My great aunt took me around to churches where I performed for pennies and peppermint sticks. `` When I was 10 or 11 I really liked this girl and we'd read fairy tales together. She'd be the damsel in distress and I'd be Prince Charming. The kids would gather around and watch and say, ` Go on, kiss her!''' After college, he worked in the post office and acted in community theater productions. A television commercial got him into the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>. He was in a production of `` MacBird,'' which got him into Actors Equity, and his first movie, `` Medium Cool,'' got him into the Screen Actors Guild. `` I knew I had to leave <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to find film work,'' he said. `` I saw in a trade paper that <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, who was casting for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, was looking for talent. I wrote her a letter. I was pretty naive. But she called me and I got an audition for ` Here Come the Brides.' After that I did several episodes of the show.''

<HEAD>Summit Offered A Forum To Show Off Soviet Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit offered the Soviets a forum to show off <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and a chance to boost the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader on the eve of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference crucial to the success of his policies. While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media devoted much space and time to the meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet media devoted at least as much space _ if not more _ to discussion of the party conference and a reform document published on the eve of the summit that outlines more, potentially radical reforms. Soviet television coverage of the summit, meanwhile, portrayed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a dynamic, worldwise leader. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> helped promote that image during his stay by repeatedly acknowledging the blossoming of the state-run arts and media, restructuring of the economy and freeing of some political prisoners under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In fact, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared so impressed with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies that he withdrew his earlier characterization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire.'' And when it came time for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to leave, he bid a warm farewell to a leader he said had become a personal friend. But the air of good will did not hide the fact that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is waging a battle to win the support of the 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegates to the national conference, which begins June 28. The conference is the first of its kind since 1941. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said he wants `` partisans of perestroika,'' his effort to restructure Soviet society, elected as delegates to the conference. At the same time, the Soviet leader has indicated that he does not want any party conflicts out in the open, and he studiously avoided mention of the party conference during the summit. But that did not stop Soviet reformers from speaking out about the fierce fight being waged by orthodox Communists and outspoken <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> supporters over delegate elections to the conference. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist party boss dropped from the ruling Politburo last February, took the most dramatic step, giving two interviews to Western television stations in which he called for the resignation of the Kremlin's No. 2 official, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is said to have criticized the slow pace of reform in an unpublished speech last Oct. 21 that led to his ouster. This week, he took the unprecedented step of using Western interviews to assail <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> for allegedly blocking reform. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> insisted at his news conference last week that there is no movement to force <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> to step down. At the same time, however, the pro-reform weekly <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> and the weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News _ available in English, Spanish, French, German and Arabic as well as <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> _ published candid articles about maneuvers used to ease reformers off the conference slate. Organizers of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s fledgling independent political party, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> founded on May 4, held a meeting of 1,500 people in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> last weekend demanding a multi-party system and fairer delegate selection. Smaller protests on this and other issues, such as Jewish emigration, took place daily in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the summit, with police watching in silence. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> students went to the city's <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> last week to collect signatures on a petition demanding he be a conference delegate. Sociologist <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> told Western reporters in news conferences or interviews that they failed to gain election as delegates in an initial round of voting. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said the problems were due to the fact that `` we are learning democracy.'' <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, too, blamed the maneuvering on the lack of a political culture. `` We have to learn not to be afraid,'' he said in an interview. `` We have to get rid of the Stalinist remnants. Under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, it was easy. He had a theory of enemies that made everybody afraid of one another.'' Banging on a desk for emphasis, he added, `` If you thought this desk was bad, you could just say it was made by enemies. Simple as that.'' `` Perestroika,'' he added, `` is just a big return to the norm. We have to become normal again.'' Foreign Ministry press center officials were swift to accede to Western reporters' requests for interviews with the most outspoken proponents of reform, who also took the dais at news conferences for hundreds of journalists. Known conservatives were not seen at such forums, and were not strongly in evidence at a meeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had with writers and intellectuals last Tuesday. This could be the result of what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself has described as passive, panicky resistance to his reforms. This maneuvering has not so far emerged into a publicly identifiable political movement. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> also noted that `` the conservatives have not yet presented a program, and have not suggested any new leader'' to replace <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as Communist party general secretary. He said he expected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to emerge strengthened from the conference. The public relations campaign for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms that was waged during the summit certainly convinced a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> taxi driver, who said he was from the Soviet leader's home region in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is like <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' he volunteered to a Western reporter during a conversation highly critical of Soviet life. `` Our children have all forgotten how to work, and he will get them going again.''

 The stock market ran up a sharp gain for the second straight session as fears of rising interest rates and inflation continued to abate on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 32.89 points Wednesday to 2,064.01, bringing its gain over the past two sessions to 107.57 points. Seasoned market watchers expressed surprise at the buying spree following the long Memorial Day weekend. Many analysts said the rally once again proved the adage that you can not outguess the market.

 Construction spending advanced 0.1 percent in April as a boom in factory construction helped offset weakness in government projects, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. The department said Wednesday that building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 401.8 billion in April, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier. But analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and instead focus on a big 8.8 percent rise in spending on industrial plants, which put activity in this sector up a remarkable 39.8 percent above where it was a year earlier.

<HEAD>Germans Rushing To Boost Trade With Soviets; Washington Concerned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 West German businesses, lured in part by promises of economic reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, are rushing to boost their trade with the Kremlin. They range from the mighty <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which recently arranged a $ 2 billion line of credit for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, to the sporting goods company <ORGANIZATION> Adidas </ORGANIZATION>, which already is making products in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but is looking to expand. While a string of new collaborations were announced in May, the growing trend has sparked some criticism from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., without referring by name to <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviets `` are using these loans to finance military mischief, I fear, around the world. But Soviet economists say that is unlikely. `` Soviet consumers want better products,'' said <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Giesecke </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> and Trade Conference office. `` Once they have them, they're not going back to the old ways.'' Still, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> at a recent senate committee hearing, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense officials had discussed the situation `` in general terms because they put an added defense burden on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies.'' The allies, however, could also complain about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with the Soviets, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which serves as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s front line of defense against the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> pact, has seen its trade with the Soviets decline for the past three years. West German imports from the Soviets have nearly halved to $ 4.27 billion since 1984, and exports to the Soviets are down to $ 4.6 billion, from $ 6.3 billion three years ago. Seventy percent of Soviet exports to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are natural gas and oil products, which are purchased with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. But a low dollar and cheap oil prices have taken their toll, cutting into the foreign currency supplies the Soviets need import goods. Increased ties to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> fit Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to improve conditions at home, Soviet economists say. To encourage foreign investment, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has begun allowing Western concerns to own a share of Soviet industries. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettmar </PERSON> said that it is too early to tell how the line of credit will be used by the Soviets, but `` it is intended for light industry consumer products, such as shoes and foodstuffs, and joint venture projects to expand that market with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Any business deals will be announced by the companies taking part, not the bank. `` We and the other banks involved only make the money available,'' he said. Among the German companies that announced deals last month were: _ Salamander, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest shoe producer, which already produces shoes in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, said it would up its production with a new plant in <LOCATION> Vitebsk </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Lurgi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> said it was heading a consortium of companies awarded a $ 294 million contract to build two new oil and gas plants to expand production in the <LOCATION> Tengiuz </LOCATION> oil fields near the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Adidas </ORGANIZATION> will begin making sports textiles in <LOCATION> Tbilis </LOCATION> by the end of this year The company has been making shoes in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since 1978 and in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> since 1984. _ MAN, producer of heavy vehicles, announced a joint venture with the Soviets to produce long-haul trucks To help finance the deals the Soviets are looking West for hard currency. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank sources said the Soviets are planning to sell $ 294 million in Eurobonds in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. That sale would follow a $ 70 million bond the Soviets floated five months ago in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Slowdown Reported In Export Growth In May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s exports in May rose 16 percent to $ 4.67 billion but appear to be slowing from the brisk pace set in the first four months of the year, the Trade and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Exports totaled $ 4.67 billion last month, compared with $ 4.02 billion a year ago. But they increase fell short of the 32.5 percent average boost during the first four months of the year. The setback was attributed to recent labor disputes over wage hikes in auto and some other export-sensitive industries as well as the appreciation of the Korean won against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The won has risen about 8 percent in value since January. Imports in May totaled $ 4.23 billion, up 16.6 percent from $ 3.63 billion a year ago. The trade surplus in May amouted to $ 435 million, compared with $ 437 million in April and $ 395 million in May 1987. The May surplus was the smallest since February. For the past five months, exports totaled $ 22.1 billion, up 28.6 percent from a year ago, while imports rose 30.7 percent to $ 19.83 billion, according to the ministry's preliminary figures.

<HEAD>Government Rolls Back Some Anti-Alcohol Measures, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has relaxed curbs on the production of alcohol and lifted some restrictions on the sale of booze in a slackening of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-drunkenness drive, a weekly newspaper reports. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, which is at the forefront of the Soviet leader's campaign for `` glasnost,'' or openness, did not say what restrictions on sales were removed But the labor newspaper Trud reported last month that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city authorities had recently allowed an expansion of the number of stores selling alcoholic beverages to 772. It did not give the previous figure. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, in its Wednesday editions, and Trud gave two reasons for the easing of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-alcoholism campaign: to try to discourage moonshining and stop a run on sugar. The moonshiners, who <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said are outproducing the legal alcohol industry, use sugar to make alcohol. Sugar is being rationed in several <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities, but <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said it is not in short supply, adding that sugar supplies were greater in 1988 than last year. Increased sales of alcohol and the stabilization of alcohol production should reduce the use of sugar by moonshiners, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-alcohol campaign, his first major initiative after taking power in March 1985, included raising the drinking age, shortening the hours of liquor stores and cutting liquor production. Soviet officials have credited the campaign with increasing the life expectancy and cutting drunkenness on the job. but <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, a prominent economist, told reporters last week <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been going about trying to reduce alcoholism the wrong way. He said the campaign has encouraged moonshiners and taken revenue from liquor sales away from the government. Instead, said <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, the government should improve consumer supplies `` so a man could use his ruble to buy a bottle of vodka or a good shirt.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported late last year that more than 4.5 million of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 284 million people are `` registered alcoholics,'' 1 million of whom require compulsory care.

<HEAD>Hallmark Halts Shipment Of Alcohol-Related Graduation Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hallmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it had stopped making graduation cards containing humorous references to drinking after they got a cool reception from a Mothers Against Drunk Driving chapter. Hallmark decided Tuesday `` to discontinue manufacturing and shipping alcohol-related graduation cards,'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company, said Wednesday. However, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, chapter of <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, said Hallmark had not done enough because the cards were still available in some stores. Ms. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the graduation season is nearly over and that the cards would soon been removed from store shelves. The company said the decision to withdraw cards was up to retailers. Two stores in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, pulled the cards at the request of CASA, an Orange, Calif.-based group that works against drinking, drug use and pregnancy among teen-agers, said organization chairwoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyner </PERSON>. `` Every day these cards are on the market, they are going to be selling,'' she said. `` This has to be nipped right away.'' The controversy arose last week when parents of students at <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, showed <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> officials two cards. One card, depicting a refrigerator filled with beer and a single egg, advises, `` Do n't go to graduation without a good breakfast first.'' Another suggests that graduates wear loose-fitting gowns so they can `` hide at least two bottles of champagne underneath.'' `` How can a company which advertises ` When you care enough to send the very best, send Hallmark,' produce cards which encourage alcohol and drunken driving?'' asked Ms. Cater. `` Hallmark offers about 600 graduation card designs, and less than 1 percent deal with alcohol-related subject matter,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>. `` It is a very small percentage.'' The <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, Calif.-based Grad Night Foundation, which promotes sober graduations, is urging <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> members to ask shops to pull the cards, said foundation director <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Warmington </PERSON>. `` This is such a national issue now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Warmington </PERSON> said. `` Incidents like this really fan the flames. It's inconceivable -LRB- Hallmark -RRB- can be so lacking in sensitivity.'' `` We are certainly concerned, and we feel our actions are an appropriate response,'' replied Ms. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 After three months of lawsuits, talk of a recapitalization plan and a flurry of political support, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> succumbed to a $ 1.7 billion takeover bid from British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>. The construction materials and chemicals company, one of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> road repair concerns, agreed Wednesday to be acquired for $ 61 a share by <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We set out to keep the company independent, but business as it is currently conducted did n't give us that opportunity,'' <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said after the board unanimously approved the merger. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s struggle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> aroused intense hostility in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> is a major employer. It led to legal wrangling in federal court and compelled local members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to introduce anti-takeover measures. The battle also ignited sharp criticism over <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s role in participating in a hostile takeover while helping to finance it. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' congressional allies were quick to note that <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s victory does not quiet those concerns `` The question for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remains about the role of the investment bankers, where they were essentially both soliciting the deal and providing the wherewithall,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa. `` That to me is something that we ought to remain concerned about,'' said <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, one of 15 congressmen who petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for an investigation `` It's not approprite for securities firms and foreign corporations with banking interests to be involved in hostile takeovers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., who vowed to support new regulations Ridge and <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON> co-sponsored a bill barring foreign banks and domestic financial services firms from hostile takeovers. But their efforts, like a bill introduced by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., fell short of helping <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> A key feature of the merger agreement is job guarantees for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> employees. About 7,000 salaried workers will be guaranteed jobs for at least one year or get a year's pay, and hourly employees are covered by contracts that remain in force, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition, payments from a 32-year-old deferred compensation plan will be accelerated to some of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' 460 active and retired managers, but `` nobody is going to get more under this merger than they had when <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> was ... totally independent,'' <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said he would delay for 45 days plans to sell the chemicals business, giving managers a chance to make an offer. He agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> will remain headquartered in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> for at least three years. <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' greatest hope of surviving on its own was a recapitalization plan it claimed would compete with <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. But management's deal collapsed last week when an unidentified prospective buyer backed out of purchasing part of the construction materials business, he said. Koppers opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> traces back to March 3, when <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 45-a-share tender offer. BNS boosted the offer to $ 60 a share on March 25 and sweetened it by $ 1 during weekend negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> won anti-takeover injunctions in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ruling, concerning antitrust issues, fell last week on appeal, and the judge in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> offered BNS options for overcoming apparent violations of securities laws. On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Wednesday at $ 60.50 a share, up $ 1.50. Analysts were satisfied with the $ 61-a-share payout. `` That's a good value for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' said analyst <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harriman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In the end, <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> insisted that the merger agreement was reached `` with my complete cooperation'' and that the takeover fulfills management's commitment to enhance shareholder value. `` Now that the drama has ended, we are looking forward to getting on with the job, putting together a world class aggregates company and beating the competition,'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said. The tender offer was extended until June 15.

<HEAD>Coleco Offers Equity to Debtholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to offer to make its debtholders majority owners of the company if they agree to a restructuring of the company's debt. The ailing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> toy maker made the announcement Wednesday as it extended a debt-exchange proposal a fourth time, this time until June 30. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has pinned its hopes for recovery on a plan to exchange $ 335 million of debt for $ 119 million of new debt and 6 million shares of common stock. But that offer, launched March 23, was rejected by debtholders because it reduced the value of their investment in the company by about 65 percent. Debtholders also complained that the plan did not require similar sacrifices from <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> stockholders, who would have seen only a 34 percent reduction in the value of their investment if 6 million more shares of stock were issued. In a short statement, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said it is preparing a revised offer that would respond to the concerns of debt holders. Without giving specifics, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said the new plan would offer more bonds, nearly as much as the $ 335 million of original securities that would be replacing. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said the new offer would include enough new shares of common stock to give bondholders `` more than a majority equity interest'' in the restructured company. With 17.8 million shares of stock outstanding currently, that indicates that 18 million new shares of stock would have to be issued under the new plan. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the company might have to seek protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy laws unless it can restructure the debt and raise working capital. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic tricycles, and board games such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit. Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the nation's toy market.

 The stock market declined broadly today, giving up some of its recent gains as interest rates turned upward. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 11.56 to 2,052.45 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 301 up, 718 down and 414 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.15 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Interest rates rose in the credit markets this morning, reversing a sharp decline Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts also noted an increase in British interest rates. That prompted many traders to sell stocks in order to cash in on the gains of the past two sessions, brokers said. The upswing in stock prices since the start of the week was met with considerable skepticism on Wall Street, given continued signs of upward pressure on commodity prices. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LCB- to 50 ~ Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said he would probably sell his large stake in the company if he should lose his bid to gain control of five seats on the board of directors.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to pay partial second-quarter dividends to stockholders June 30. At a monthly board meeting Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors voted to pay roughly $ 1.085 on each share of Series B convertible preferred stock that was sold to finance part of the $ 1.5 billion, federally-assisted restructuring of the Houston-based holding company. After overcoming weeks of delays spurred by hesitant debtholders, the transaction was completed April 19. The dividend, the first to be paid by the restructured company, will be paid to stockholders of record June 15. The Series B preferred bears a $ 5.50 annual dividend rate, and the partial dividend will cover the period between April 19 and June 30, First City officials said. The restructuring was completed using $ 500 million of private capital, including the sale of 2.45 million preferred shares, a $ 970 million note from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and a $ 108 million loan from a group of banks. First City spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said the company has been profitable since April 19, when the transaction was completed.

 Grain and soybean futures opened lower, then quickly turned mixed to higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The lower opening reflected the tail end of Wednesday's profit-taking and reports of light rain in the eastern Corn Belt, analysts said New buying interest surfaced in response to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s prediction of below-normal rainfall in most grain-producing areas for the period June 7-11.

 Stock prices pulled back today after rising sharply over the past two sessions, and the nation's largest general retailers reported May sales that analysts described as lackluster. At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 107.57 points Tuesday and Wednesday, was off 6.76 at 2,057.25. Analysts said some traders sold stocks to cash in on the gains of the past two sessions. They noted that interest rates, which had fallen earlier this week, turned higher today. In the latest round of retail sales reports, major storeowners reported their sales were marginally higher or actually fell last month. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, said its overall sales last month rose 5.1 percent from May 1987 levels, while sales from stores open at least a year _ also known as same-store sales _ rose only 0.2 percent. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 6 percent last month, while same-store sales rose only 2.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales fell 1.2 percent last month and same-store sales fell 1.4 percent On Wednesday, the government reported April gains in its chief economic forecasting gauge as well as in factory orders and construction spending. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported its Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.2 percent in April, following rises of 0.2 percent rise in March and 1.5 percent in February. The March increase in the leading index originally was reported as a much stronger 0.8 percent rise. However, weakness in consumer and business borrowing pulled the index down sharply. The government also reported that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods climbed 1.2 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted $ 218.7 billion following an even bigger 1.6 percent March increase. Most economists had been forecasting only modest growth in new orders of 0.5 percent in April. The bigger-than-expected number likely will do little to alleviate concern among some analysts that strong demand, particularly for exports, will trigger greater inflation. The strength in new orders in April came in electrical machinery, lumber and wood products and in petroleum, chemicals and paper. In a third report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending rose 0.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $ 401.8 billion, following a 1.3 percent jump in March and a 0.4 percent February increase. Analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and focused on a big 8.8 percent rise in spending on industrial plants, which put activity in this sector up 39.8 percent from where it was a year earlier. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the gain reflected the boom in export sales, which has meant plants in many industries are operating near full capacity. Government construction fell by 3.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $ 79.3 billion. Residential construction posted a 0.4 percent advance in April to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion, while non-residential construction climbed 2.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $ 94.4 billion. In another economic report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports climbed to a 3 -LCB- - year high of 14.8 million tons valued at $ 3.3 billion in March A year earlier, farm exports were 11.4 million tons valued at $ 2.4 billion.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s state oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> has begun marketing a new high-grade crude in the international petroleum market, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Abundio </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, deputy director of primary production for <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, said the company last month exported 250,000 42-gallon barrels of the new crude, called <LOCATION> Olmeca </LOCATION>. He did not identify the purchaser. He said the new crude can be priced a dollar more a barrel than the Isthmus brand, which previously was the nation's superior oil. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also exports a heavy crude, called Maya. `` -LRB- Olmeca -RRB- is much finer than Isthmus -LRB- and -RRB- it is superior to Arab light,'' <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> told local reporters at an oil conference on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> drilling, according to the article, which was published Thursday. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he said, has the capacity to eventually export 125,000 barrels to 150,000 barrels a day of the new crude, which is being extracted from fields in the southeastern state of Tabasco along the coast of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> said the new oil has a density of between 38 and 40 on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> scale, compared to a density of 32 to 34 for Isthmus. The English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the government `` is not yet sure how much light oil it has. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> is still exploring.'' `` There is probably not much Olmeca in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that prices to Japanese clients for Isthmus and Maya crudes were held steady in May The price for Isthmus was $ 15.30 a barrel in May to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the same as in April, and for Maya, $ 12.60 a barrel. `` This reflects the stability that prevails in the general level of prices in the international oil market,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has a contract with Japanese customers to supply 180,000 barrels of oil a day, the statement said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s prices vary according to geographical area. The oil company did not give the May prices for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European customers. In April, the price of the Isthmus brand to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers was $ 16 a barrel and $ 12.77 for the heavy type. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> maintains an export platform of 1.36 million barrels a day.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stock Exchange To Raise Margin Requirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would raise its margin requirement for stock purchases from 60 percent to 70 percent as of June 3 because of recent gains in share prices and volume. A substantial rise in margin transactions also prompted the move, exchange officials said. Traders however said the action was likely to have little effect on the market and added that changes in the margin requirement in the past had failed to have strong impact on the exchange. The margin requirement represents the down payment needed for investors who purchase stock with borrowed money. On May 16, the TSE raised the margin requirement to the current 60 percent from 50 percent. The next day, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues rose 167.86 points to top its close on the day before the October crash. It rose another 93 points the day after that and then surged 1,001 points over three sessions early the next week to surpass its pre-crash high. Over the past four sessions this week, the main market barometer has risen 906.86 points. It closed Thursday at a record high 27,869.36 points. Volume, meanwhile, this week has averaged around 1.8 billion shares a day, compared with around 1.1 billion shares a day last week. On Wednesday, volume in terms of shares traded reached the highest level since the market crash after 2.561 billion shares were traded for the second highest one-day volume ever. On Tuesday, the TSE announced that in the week ended May 28, the balance of margin buying rose 208.1 billion yen to 6.485 trillion yen. It was the fourth consecutive weekly rise, and a historical high balance of long positions.

The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and the West German mark in the last few days as the market's attention has shifted away from sterling into the dollar and other major currencies. The British base rate was last changed on May 17, when it was cut to 7.5 percent from 8 percent as British authorities attempted to estrain a strong rise in the pound. Corporate borrowers can obtain loans from commercial banks at one percentage point above the base rate.

 About 200 capitalists converged here Thursday for a weekend of caviar on the Great Wall, boat rides on an imperial pleasure lake and a display of opulence not seen in this spartan socialist capital since 1949. The participants, from 21 countries, are spending $ 4,300 each to enjoy such Western luxuries as a masked ball and champagne breakfast at sites of past Chinese imperial glory. For $ 5,200 more, 100 of them will spend 10 days touring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous scenic spots The weekend event, dubbed `` The Return of Marco Polo'' after the 13th century Venetian adventurer, was organized by a French group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Save <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and the Great Wall, headed by public relations agent <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vial </PERSON>. The proceeds were intended to help restore the Great Wall, reduced in many sections by weather and war to a heap of stones, and to preserve the art and architecture of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. But Vial said Chinese officials are charging such high fees for transportation, food, site rentals and services that most of the ticket receipts will be needed to cover expenses. He cited a $ 54,000 charge by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> municipal authorities to rent a section of the Great Wall for four hours Saturday so the guests can lunch there on caviar and champagne. `` I'm not sure they -LRB- Chinese officials -RRB- got exactly the concept of a charity,'' Vial told a news conference this week. `` They charge us the maximum.'' The number of high-paying guests also is less than half what was expected, Vial acknowledged. He said Chinese delays in confirming arrangements made it impossible to advertise far enough in advance. The organizers now say any funds to help the Great Wall or <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> will have to come from the final event of the weekend, a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction Sunday of donated modern Western and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> art and rare objects. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s has estimated the 67 items, including a 1777 bottle of cognac, a pottery jug painted by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and a painting by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, the daughter of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, should fetch $ 695,400 to $ 869,000. However, auctioneer <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said no one is really sure what to expect It will be the first auction of Western art in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the Communist takeover in 1949. The cheapest item in the sale is expected to be a Sevres porcelain cup valued from $ 215 to $ 320 _ about how much an average Chinese factory worker earns annually. Despite uncertainty about how much will be reaped for charity, plenty of cash will flash during the weekend. The guests will be ferried about in black Red Flag limousines, entertained by Chinese acrobats and singers, fed on caviar, French cuisine and brandy and allowed to party at some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most sacred national monuments. They will boat at the luxurious 19th century Summer Palace and hold a Venetian masked ball and watch fireworks at the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> state guesthouse. They will breakfast at the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heaven </ORGANIZATION>, where the emperor offered sacrifices for a good harvest, dine in the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the imperial palace in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and watch Chinese and Western performers Saturday night at the Great Hall of the People. The guests gathered at the weekend's first event, a cocktail party in the garden of the glass-plated <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, serenaded by Chinese musicians playing ancient instruments. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman, asked why he was willing to pay so much, said with a shrug, `` To have fun.'' `` We are not in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> now,'' said a Frenchman who, like the American, spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It's as if we are in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' Organizers said several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nobility signed up for the weekend, but most of those at the party seemed to be involved in business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police will shield the guests from contact with ordinary <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents, among who the main topic of conversation lately has been 30 to 60 percent increases in the prices of pork, eggs and sugar. Former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>, when asked at the cocktail party if such displays of wealth were appropriate in impoverished <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, call income differences `` an objective reality.'' `` We are trying to make our country prosperous,'' he said. `` We need all kinds of help.''

 Government prosecutors Thursday arrested two senior officials of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and charged them with paying a group of men to kidnap a labor organizer. The prosecutors said they are trying to determine whether other <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials were involved in the kidnapping. The organizer was freed after several days when he resigned as an employee of the construction company. Earlier Thursday, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks at the headquarters of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to protest the kidnapping at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. No injuries were reported. The arrests and the attack by the students came as labor unrest continued at three other <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> plants in southern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group is one of the largest conglomerates in the nation. In <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, management on Wednesday locked out 20,000 striking workers at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, and said there was little chance of settling the strike for higher wages. The walkout began Monday. At <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes trains, management and leaders of the 4,000 strikers held two rounds of talks Thursday but failed to end a one-week strike at the company's plants in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> The talks were held one day after strikers freed one of the 11 executives they took hostage on Friday. They were still holding 10 executives on Thursday. Strikers at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> want raises of up to $ 180 a month, against a company offer of $ 105. The workers earn an average of $ 750 after five years. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday offered to raise workers' pay $ 85 a month, but workers stuck to their demand of a $ 180 increase. They earn $ 600 a month. `` Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the students shouted as they hurled rocks at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group's main building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, breaking four windows. The students ran away before police arrived. Several hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested two <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> officials, executive board member <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jae-dong </PERSON>, 47, and manager for general affairs <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-ku </PERSON>, 42, and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizer <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-ui </PERSON>, 34. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as he left a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> restaurant where he had met with some officials of the construction company, which is based in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, who worked at the company's <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> headquarters, returned home several days later and said he was released after he agreed to write a letter of resignation addressed to the company. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> Engineering denied involvement at the time. Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of the alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities. Their leader told police <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> executives offered him $ 27,000 to kidnap <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> and persuade him to drop his labor organizing effort.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it wants to increase its service charges on operator-assisted, interstate calls to help offset rising costs. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said its service charge for all out-of-state collect calls, calls billed to a third number and pay-phone calls would rise to $ 1.75. The service charge on most of those calls is now $ 1.55 and lower for short-distance calls. The service charge on operator-dialed calls charged to an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T credit card, now $ 1.55, also would rise to $ 1.75. Also, the company would set a uniform surcharge of 80 cents for interstate <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T credit card calls that are customer-dialed. The charge for most of these calls is already 80 cents, but it is 60 cents for short-distance calls that cross state lines. The company additionally is proposing to raise its service charge on interstate, person-to-person calls from $ 3 to $ 3.50. The proposed increases would go into effect July 16, under plans <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> must approve the increases before they can take effect. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said its service charges for operator-assisted calls have not changed since 1982, though costs for providing those services have risen an average of $ 159 million a year during the past five years. As part of the proposal, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> also wants to charge callers 75 cents for calls they ask the operator to dial, beginning Dec. 1. The charge would not apply if the caller is unable to complete his or her call for any reason, including customer error, but callers would have to tell the operator they had tried to dial the call themselves. It also would not apply to disabled customers who need an operator's assistance. The company said that for one year its operators would inform callers if they are subject to the 75-cent surcharge. Also beginning Dec. 1, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T wants to charge out-of-state callers $ 2 to have an operator verify a busy line is in use and another $ 2 if the caller wants the operator to interrupt the call. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T currently does not charge for these services.

<HEAD>FMC Inks $1 Billion Pact With Turkey; Announces Tank Sale To
Saudis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> moved Thursday toward increased weapons sales in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> by signing a $ 1 billion pact to jointly produce armored vehicles for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and announcing a $ 400 million sale to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Saudi order, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month, represents Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>'s first foreign sales of its Bradley Fighting Vehicle and could open the door for similar sales to other friendly countries in the region, a spokeswoman said. `` Sure, it's a possibility,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brozowski </PERSON>. `` It's hard to judge right now what the overall potential is but we'll certainly see what happens.'' The previously announced $ 1 billion deal calling for <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nurol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> to produce 1,700 smaller armored vehicles for the Turkish government is a `` crucial element'' of <PERSON> Tukey </PERSON>'s defense-modernization plan, said <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malott </PERSON> `` Through participation in this contract ... FMC-Nurol will contribute to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s economic dynamism,'' <PERSON> Malott </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for an afternoon signing ceremony with Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will benefit from the sale of some U.S.-produced components to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Malott </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>, a leader in armored-vehicle manufacturing and technology, produced the Turkish army's exisiting fleet of M113 personnel carriers. The new contract is for Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicles, which are popular because they can operate in water without add-on flotation devices and are small enough to be transported in C-130 class aircraft. The vehicles have 25mm cannons and the capacity to carry 10 people at a maximum speed of 45 mph. The agreement calls for FMC-Nurol to deliver 1,700 vehicles over an eight-year period from the joint venture's manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The percentage of the vehicles' content produced in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> will steadily rise to 73 percent in the last contract year, <PERSON> Malott </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> will own 51 percent of FMC-Nurol and hold a majority of the positions on the joint venture's board, he said. The agreement represents one of the largest joint ventures undertaken by <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>, which has previously co-produced armored troop carriers in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Malott </PERSON> said. The sale of 200 <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> vehicles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, with deliveries expected to begin in 1990, expands <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>'s customer base for Bradleys beyond the Pentagon for the first time. The Pentagon has purchased about 3,400 of the vehicles since the early 1980s, Ms. <PERSON> Brozowski </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, touted by <PERSON> Malott </PERSON> as `` the <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> of its type'' but reviled by some military critics, is equipped with surface-to-surface rocket launchers and 25mmm cannons. The Saudi order also specifies that the Bradleys be air-conditioned. `` Deserts, you know,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Brozowski </PERSON>.

 The stock market pulled back today, giving up some of its recent gains as interest rates turned upward. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 107.57 points Tuesday and Wednesday, fell 10.49 to 2,053.52 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Stocks In Yugoslav Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Yugoslav government, faced with a deepening economic crisis, is considering a plan to allow citizens of this communist country to buy stocks and securities, the state-run press reported Thursday. A draft of the reform, proposed by a government-appointed comission of about 140 prominent economists and scientists, has been presented to the federal parliament for debate, newspapers said. Stocks and bonds would be issued by state-run companies and could be purchased by their workers or other citizens, said the <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` In this case, a shareholder takes over -LRB- part of -RRB- the risk of managing the company,'' said the report. Except for small cooperative and private ventures, the majority of Yugoslav enterprises are owned by the state. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economy, a mixture of free-market elements and Soviet-style central planning, has been growing at a sluggish rate averaging less than 1 percent annually over the past six years. The reform also calls for the sale or a temporary lease of a state-run company to its workers or other citizens in case the state is not interested in ownership. The draft of the reform also indicates that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> plans to gear its economy more to the market to overcome difficulties that include a 15 percent unemployment rate, a $ 21 billion foreign debt and an inflation rate of around 170 percent, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The government last Saturday launched a major austerity program that included substantial price hikes, wage cuts of up to 30 percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the Dinar, the national currency. The program also lifted price controls for about 60 percent of goods and services, under a price freeze since last November. As a result, Yugoslavs have been hit by a new wave of price hikes for hundreds of goods and services of up to 127 percent. Food, drinks, cars, rents and air transport were affected by the increases. Meat went up by an average 50 percent, rents in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> by 90 percent and domestic air travel by 127 percent. The price hikes are bound to contribute to a further decline in living standards, which have already fallen by one-third since 1980. Labor unrest is also expected to grow.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> are being operated safely but labor turmoil at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> raises the risk of safety problems there, an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded today. The report said that a close inspection of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of the two airlines, showed no serious management or financial problems, but that labor strife at Eastern may have a future impact on public safety. As a result of the continuing labor problems, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> planned to continue close scrutiny of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s operations and former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> will attempt to work with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management and labor to ease tensions. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told a news conference that `` an unsafe condition does not currently exist'' at either Eastern or Continental. But <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> voiced concerns that safety may be jeopardized at Eastern in the future by the `` extreme labor-management tensions'' at the airline. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said that the department's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its two major airline subsidiaries showed no safety problems at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. It did, however, find a serious lack of communication between labor and management at Eastern. The department also said it found no evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s extensive financial losses last year posed any serious financial problems, saying the company had adequate resources and its management was found to be `` fit, willing and able'' to run an airline. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>'s role will be to `` work for ways to de-escalate the -LRB- labor-management -RRB- tensions'' at Eastern. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said he had been in contact with most of the parties involved in the Eastern turmoil but that he had not yet developed a game plan on how to ease those tensions. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that an in-depth, plane-by-plane inspection at both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> had not shown anything that would warrant extreme safety concerns. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, repeatedly has blamed labor unons at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for his two airlines' problems, accusing the unions of waging a campaign against the airline to discredit its safety record. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced its two-pronged investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> on April 13, including a plane-by-plane examination of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors. Five days later the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> safety inspection was broaded to include <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as well. In conjunction with the announcement of the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it was proposing a $ 823,000 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> because of safety violations found in special reviews of the Miami-based airline last year. During the 30-day inspections of Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials repeatedly examined each aircraft at airport gates to determine if they were following federal air safety requirements. The separate probe of the parent company focused on possible management and financial concerns. DOT investigators wanted to determine if the executives of the Houston-based holding company are `` fit, willing and able'' to operate an airline according to federal aviation laws. There had been pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the department to open an investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in light of the company's huge losses, including $ 466 million last year, and its continuing labor turmoil at Eastern. A resolution calling for a such an investigation gained the support of 150 congressmen. In announcing the special probe, officials cited a pattern of safety violations at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reflected by the latest $ 823,000 fine, which came on top of a $ 9.5 million civil penalty from earlier <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> safety violations. The department also had raised concern about recent financial transactions involving <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern, including attempts by the airline to spin off <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative Northeast shuttle. The shuttle spinoff has been blocked by the courts. These transactions raised quetions about whether the managers of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have complied with federal safety and economic practices that are required of commercial air carriers under federal aviation law, <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> officials said in April. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> are the key airlines under <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It also owns <ORGANIZATION> Rockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Britt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Provincetown-Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. None of the smaller carriers specifically was subject to the DOT or <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigations.

 Soybean futures prices surged Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and grain futures posted moderate gains on forecasts for continued warm, dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The soybean market, already more sensitive than the grains to weather factors because of tight-supply concerns, got an additional boost from indications the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had recently purchased more than 1 million metric tons of soybean meal from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> processors and was looking for more. `` There was tremendous strength coming out of the meal market,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I think the bean rally was due to the rally in meal more than anything else.'' Soybean meal futures posted near-limit gains with the contract for delivery in July closing $ 7.30 higher at $ 253 a ton. The chances for widespread rains in the Corn Belt remained slim, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted below-normal rainfall in most grain-producing areas for most of next week. At the close, wheat was -LCB- cent to 3 \ cents higher with July at $ 3.51 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.24 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 7 \ cents to 8 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.86 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were .01 cent lower to 18 \ cents higher with July at $ 8.20

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> fleshed out its 14-month-old Personal System-2 line of personal computers Thursday with reliable new models that include what would be the world's fastest PC. But <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s top rival in speedy personal computers, hinted it would strike back with one even faster that would reach the market before <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a product announcement for June 20. `` In the time frame that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has indicated they might deliver their product, we will continue to have the highest performance 386-based machines in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON>, vice president for marketing at Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the fastest version of its new Model 70, to be available in the July-September period, will be up to 50 percent faster than the Model 80, its fastest currently available computer. Its price will be $ 11,295. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also announced two other versions of the Model 70 available immediately, starting at $ 5,995, and a version of its Model 50 starting at $ 3,995 that is up to 35 percent faster than the current model. Also introduced was a version of the Model 25, the smallest and cheapest member of the Personal System-2 family, that is designed for use in office networks. Hard disk drives are also available for the Model 25 for the first time. Those products are available this month. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the new computers are up to five times more reliable than the original PC, introduced in 1981. It said its one-year maintenance contract on a Model 60 is about $ 200 a year, compared to the $ 600 to $ 800 a year charged by competitors for computers of similar power. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> reduced prices on the Model 60 and Model 80 by 5 to 18 percent to keep them in line with the improved new models. Analysts are expecting announcements of improvements in those products in coming months.

 Stock prices suffered a mild setback today, giving up some of their recent gains as interest rates turned upward. Interest rates rose in the credit markets, reversing a sharp decline Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts also noted an increase in British interest rates. That prompted many traders to sell stocks in order to cash in on the gains of the past two sessions, brokers said. The upswing in stock prices since the start of the week was met with considerable skepticism on Wall Street, given continued signs of upward pressure on commodity prices. Futures prices for commodities ranging from soybeans to gold moved up today.

<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced steps to strengthen its `` poison pill'' takeover defense Thursday, a little more than a week after it revealed plans by <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to purchase up to 25 percent of its common stock. The Georgia-based textile company announced that its board had amended its share purchase rights plan, which allows existing stockholders to purchase additional shares at reduced prices in the event of a takeover bid. The plan is designed to make a hostile takeover more expensive. Previously, the plan was effective when a person or group acquired 20 percent or more of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s common stock or announced a tender offer. Under the amendment, the threshold is 10 percent. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> announced May 25 it had been notified of <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for permission to purchase up to 25 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s approximately 32 million outstanding shares <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a conglomerate privately owned by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, includes in its holdings Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the underwear manufacturer. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> recently became the nation's largest publicly owned textile company when it acquired <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a joint buyout with <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> officials declined to confirm Thursday's action was in response to the <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> disclosure But <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a textile industry analyst with <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the directors probably took the action to protect stockholders if <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> does buy a significant portion of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock. `` Apparently it's to dilute the ownership of the outside group that's trying to buy stock,'' added <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, a textile analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. In a statement issued by the company, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the amendment will expire in two years if the 10 percent threshold has not been crossed.

<HEAD>Money Supply Up in Late May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's money supply rose in the week ended May 23, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 769.3 billion from a revised $ 768.1 billion the previous week. A broader measure of the money supply, M2, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3.009 trillion from $ 3.003 trillion. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3.782 trillion from $ 3.775 trillion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In setting its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 766.5 billion, a 5.5 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 96 million, compared with a decline of $ 1.1 billion a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 776 million, up from $ 388 million _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 276.7 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 275.6 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Silver Prices Skyrocket On Peruvian Mine Strike; Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Silver futures prices skyrocketed to seven-month highs in their largest single-day gain since last September as news of a Peruvian mine strike and continuing inflation fears unleashed a storm of speculative buying. On other markets, other precious metals also advanced sharply; copper prices leaped; grain and soybeans futures posted strong gains; livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities surged 3.25 points to 253.08, its highest level since Dec. 4, 1984. Fifteen components gained, four posted losses and two were mixed. The crippling strike at the <LOCATION> Uchucchacua </LOCATION> mine owned by <ORGANIZATION> Buenaventura </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s largest silver producer, will probably not have much impact on world silver supplies, analysts said. But the silver market has lagged behind platinum and gold in recent months, and news of the strike gave speculators an excuse to buy heavily into silver, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON>, metals analysts for <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` To some extent, there was some pent-up buying mechanism built into the market structure,'' <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> said. In addition, the broad rise in commodity prices over the past several months has fanned inflationary fears, prompting many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors to turn to precious metals for the first time since the financial markets collapsed in October, analysts said. Precious metals tend to hold their value during times of rising prices. `` We're starting to see more speculative demand here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> based on the sharp increase in the CRB index and the strength in the grains, and that obviously translates into fear of inflation,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Luben </PERSON>, executive director of investments for the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Platinum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled $ 9.10 to $ 10 higher with the contract for delivery in August at $ 471.50 a troy ounce; silver was 44 cents to 47.6 cents higher with July at $ 7.305 a troy ounce. Also on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, reports of a strike at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Toquepala </LOCATION> mine contributed to fears of tight copper supplies and helped drive futures prices sharply higher, <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> said. Copper settled 1.80 cents to 9.70 cents higher with June at $ 1.0825 a pound. Soybean futures prices surged on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and grain futures posted moderate gains on forecasts for continued warm, dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The soybean market, already more sensitive than grains to weather factors because of tight-supply concerns, got an additional boost from indications the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently purchased more than 1 million metric tons of soybean meal from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> processors and was looking for more, analysts said. `` I think the bean rally was due to the rally in meal more than anything else,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The soybean meal contract for delivery in July settled $ 7 higher at $ 252.70 a ton. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.50 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.24 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 7 \ cents to 8 \ cents higher with July at $ 1.86 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 18 cents higher with July at $ 8.19 a Cattle futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on ideas that cash prices for dressed beef were ready to rebound after a recent decline, analysts said. Pork futures retreated in anticipation of an increase in hog marketings next week as cooler weather moves into the major hog-producing states, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Hogs sometimes die if they are transported in hot weather, he said `` Hogs do n't sweat well,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` When the weather gets hot, they tend not to market hogs as aggressively.'' Live cattle settled .17 cent to .37 cent higher with June at 72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .38 cent higher with August at 76.60 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .65 cent lower with June at 53.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .95 cent lower to 1.55 cents higher with July at 57.05 cents a pound. Oil prices finished mixed in a quiet session on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 13 cents higher with July at $ 17.65 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent lower to .30 cent higher with July at 47.38 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .23 cent lower to .10 cent higher with July at 51.51 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .50 point lower at 266.35.

<TEXT>
 The dollar turned in a mixed performance Thursday in foreign exchange trading in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after rising against most major currencies in earlier dealings in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold prices rose sharply in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after falling earlier in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a bid for gold of $ 466.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 8.75 from $ 457.50 late Wednesday. Analysts cited inflation fears, sparked by persistent rises in agricultural commodity prices in recent days, for the precious metal's big gain. Currency dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the dollar's rise stemmed from the improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade performance and firmer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. They said activity was muted by the closing of West German markets for a national holiday. But the dollar finished lower in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> against the West German mark, Swiss franc and French franc and higher against the British pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. Traders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the market was buffeted throughout the session by large orders to sell British pounds and Japanese yen and buy West German marks and Swiss francs, whose value has been driven down against the pound and yen in recent days. In addition, there were unconfirmed reports that several central banks, including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, sold dollars early in the session. `` There was widespread talk of it, and the dollar came off its highs. It took some of the steam out of the rally,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The dollar closed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 125.68 Japanese yen, up from 125.35 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar reached 126.53 yen. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, the dollar rose to 126.12 yen from 125.425 yen late Wednesday. The British pound, which touched a six-year high of $ 1.90 in March, fell to $ 1.7967 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from $ 1.8220 late Wednesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.80435 from $ 1.81325 late Wednesday. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.72105 West German marks, down from 1.7308; 1.43505 Swiss francs, down from 1.44345; 5.8270 French francs, down from 5.8425; 1,281.75 Italian lira, down from 1,286.62; and 1.23075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23035. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.7295 West German marks, up from 1.7255; 1.4425 Swiss francs, up from 1.4390; 5.8502 French francs, up from 5.8270; 1.9413 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9330; 1,286.75 Italian lire, up from 1,282.50; and 1.2325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2319. Gold prices jumped on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where gold for current delivery rose $ 9.40 an ounce to $ 467. `` Inflationary expectations have been increasing,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, director for precious metals trading at <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said increases in other commodities such as soybeans had set the stage for a revival of inflation concerns. Gold is often purchased by investors as a hedge against inflation. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold fell to a late bid price of $ 454.30 a troy ounce, down from $ 456.50 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it dropped to a late bid of $ 453 from $ 457 late Wednesday. The metal closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 455.38 an ounce, down from $ 458.55. Silver bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 6.73 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.79. But silver for current delivery later jumped 44.2 cents an ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to $ 7.26 an ounce.

 A lung-cancer victim's intelligent decision to smoke despite the known risks of smoking should not be second-guessed, a tobacco company lawyer said Thursday during final arguments in a cigarette liability trial. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> `` made an informed choice, a choice people in this country have a right to make'' to use a product with associated risks, said <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON> in the second day of summations. In a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> civil suit against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> contends the tobacco companies misled the public about the danger of cigarettes. He has not specified damages. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> died four years ago at the age of 58, and if the jury awards damages it would be the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by smokers and their families. Another tobacco company lawyer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON>, argued that people have been talking about the risks of smoking for hundreds of years. `` People have been claiming that smoking is bad for you, that it's bad for your health, that it kills you, as long as these products have been on the market,'' he told the jury Thursday. `` People do things all the time they know to be risky.'' <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, also defended the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, formed and funded by the tobacco companies to study the health effects of smoking. He said no evidence in the case shows that the scientists on the council's advisory were anything but reputable and disinterested The companies presented evidence throughout the four-month trial to support their contention that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was intelligent, knew of smoking's risks through newspaper articles and warnings from relatives and made a strong-willed choice to smoke. `` It's our position that -LRB- smoking -RRB- was her decision to make, and we should n't second-guess her, not me, not Mr. <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, not Mr. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> Cipollone </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, who was expected to make his closing statement Friday. Northrip on Thursday and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> on Wednesday cited testimony by relatives who said <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> constantly told his wife to stop smoking, her mother blamed cigarettes for her father's death and two sisters called cigarettes `` coffin nails'' as youths. They also cited newspaper articles relating charges about the dangers of cigarettes. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON> focused on medical testimony by physicians who treated Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, pathologists who studied her cancer and cancer experts. He noted that physicians for the defense and the plaintiffs disagreed over what kind of lung cancer killed Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. `` Some are statistically associated with cigarette smoking _ small cell carcinoma. Some are not _ carcinoid, or atypical carcinoid,'' said <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> must convince the jury that cigarette smoking caused Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lung cancer, not that smoking causes cancer in general, <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON> told an 11-member panel that will be randomly reduced to six for deliberations. The case was expected to go to the jury Monday.

 Researchers say a genetically altered carp that grows up to 20 percent faster than normal could mean billions of dollars for the fish industry, but a critic says the carp would wreak `` havoc'' if released into lakes and streams. Scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here and <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> inserted a gene from rainbow trout into carp eggs, creating a fish that grows more quickly. `` The potential of doing this in other fish could mean billions of dollars worldwide,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, chairman of the biology department at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` If you can get organisms to grow faster and improve efficiency it will bring down the price to the consumer.'' The technique could eventually be applied to catfish, a $ 300 million-a-year industry in the South, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. However, a leading critic of genetic engineering, Washington-based lobbyist <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, said if the carp are put into the natural environment `` that could dramatically change and disrupt marine life.'' If the altered genes are transmitted to other generations `` they could overtake the environment,'' said <PERSON> Rikfin </PERSON>, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends. But <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said the fact that the fish need substantially more food means they would likely starve if released into the environment rather than being raised at a fish farm. Powers cautioned that the experiment is just a `` preliminary study'' and said he and his colleagues have not yet determined whether the altered gene can be passed on to future generations of carp. The scientists injected a gene from the pituitary gland of rainbow trout into carp eggs. The gene produces additional growth hormone, which regulates the growth of the fish. The technique for putting the gene into the carp eggs is still imprecise, with only 20 successes in 10,000 attempts. The scientists hope to produce more altered carp before publishing a study. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, a fisheries geneticist at <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no particular reason for choosing a donor gene from trout, except that it was more interesting to try a gene from a different species. He said he thought the same result could have been achieved by inserting an extra carp growth hormone gene. Powers and the two other scientists involved in the experiment, <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, a molecular biologist at the Center of Marine Biotechnology at <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, have asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to allow them to release the carp into experimental ponds to see how the fish fare outdoors. Powers said the fish would be isolated and would not allowed to escape from the holding ponds to lakes and streams, but <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said there is not enough assurance of that and wants the petition denied. Chinese scientists last year proved that genes from other animals can change the physical and chemical processes in fish. Scientists have also successfully mixed genes from different species in warm-blooded animals, such as rodents and livestock, and microbes and plants.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> sought a court order Thursday to force high-living investment adviser <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> to produce business records. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> action accused Polo, 37, and his <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a registered investment advising firm, of failing to keep books and records as required by federal securities law. The agency launched an investigation following published reports last week that some of Polo's clients are suing him in state court, alleging that he diverted $ 110 million from their accounts to support a lavish lifestyle. The day after a May 26 Wall Street Journal article on the lawsuits against Polo, federal officials went to check the books of Private Asset Management at the Fifth Avenue address listed on public documents as the firm's offices. Instead, they found <ORGANIZATION> Miguel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a fashion design firm owned by <PERSON> Polo </PERSON>, and were told the investment adviser business had moved to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> `` sometime in 1986.'' The manager of <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> also told federal officials, according to court papers, that all of the investment records had been moved to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and that she and other <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> employees had not been paid in several months. In its civil complaint, filed at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> claimed the withholding of books and records `` thwarted'' the commission's efforts to check whether the law had been broken. In other court papers, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, associate regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the agency had been unable to locate Polo or learn who his current attorney is. The front-page article in the Wall Street Journal described the Cuban born Polo as a voracious art collector with an expensively furnished apartment in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. According to the article, 13 of Polo's investors filed civil suit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court, claiming he diverted $ 110 million from their accounts. A state court has barred him from disposing of his assets, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities have seized the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> apartment and Swiss and French police are searching for Polo on financial fraud charges in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has not ruled out a sale of its herbicide `` Spike'' to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for aerial spraying of coca crops in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman said Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, whose House Government Operations panel is reviewing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battle against illegal drugs, said the use of the chemical is still possible even though <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> has expressed environmental and safety concerns. English, who spoke Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> officials, did not repeat his Wednesday statement that the Indianapolis-based corporation was a `` deserter'' in the war on drugs. The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Democrat used that critical description after <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, complained to the subcommittee that the company refused to cooperate in the coca spraying program. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> also had said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> apparently was worried about possible retaliatory measures by `` traffickers or terrorists.'' Speaking at a hearing Thursday, English said <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> officials have objected to use of the chemical tebuthiuron, sold under the name `` <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>,'' because `` they have not done the proper testing of application by air over a wide section of countryside. They have no data. They have not seen data from -LRB- the -RRB- State -LRB- Department -RRB-, and can not assume responsibility or liability.'' But he added, `` We will continue discussions. We need to acquire a herbicide against coca bushes as quickly as possible. At this point, my own perception is the door is open, discussions will continue, and hopefully a solution can be found to this particular problem.'' Later, in an interview, English expanded his remarks to say there had not been proper aerial testing in the coca producing region of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where the chemical would be sprayed. He said the area has considerable groundwater, and therefore is much different from the dry, brush areas where the herbicide is used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. English added that the company also was concerned that the coca area in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> `` may not be in friendly hands, and you may not have a pilot totally concentrating on the accuracy of spraying.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, had no immediate comment on English's statement on Thursday. But he did say the chemical is applied both by air and on the ground in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He described `` Spike'' as `` a broad-spectrum, soil-applied herbicide for brush and weed control on non-cropland, pasture and rangeland.'' The herbicide is `` approved for use in grazing lands, wildlife openings along ditchbanks, and utility rights of way. It is safe for humans, livestock, wildlife and the environment when used according to label directions.''

 The <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Samurai </PERSON>, a popular sport utility vehicle, tends to roll over in sudden turns and should be banned, the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine said Thursday. `` That car literally trips over its own feet, and I would n't want to be in it,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON>, technical director of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the monthly magazine In an article scheduled to appear in its July issue, Consumer Reports labels the Japanese-made Samurai `` not acceptable'' _ the first time it has given such a rating to a car in 10 years. American <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, defended its vehicle. `` The Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety, including stability and handling, prior to its introduction into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and stable vehicle,'' he said Thursday. Consumers Union filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> asking that the agency change its regulations to ban the Samurai, which the petition called `` wholly unsuitable for consumer use.'' A similar petition alleging the Samurai's rollover problem was filed in February by the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit, Washington-based consumer group. The government has yet to act on that petition. Both petitions demand that a stability standard for vehicles that would let the government ban any car that has an undue propensity to roll over. Consumers Union said the Samurai is the first car out of 349 tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid an obstacle in the road. At a news conference, Consumers Union officials showed a videotape in which the Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to roll over when it suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph. The car did not roll onto its side because it had been equipped with arm-like extensions to avoid a rollover. <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON> said the extensions actually improved the car's stability by lowering its center of gravity. The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep Cherokee and the Isuzu Trooper, were shown making the same maneuver without losing stability at speeds over 40 mph. `` We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON> said. `` But the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads everyday.'' Between November 1985, when the Samurai was introduced, and the end of April 1988 there have been 154,675 Samurais sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The cars have a suggested retail price of about $ 8,500. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, there have been 44 reported Samurai rollovers involving 53 injuries and 16 deaths. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFore </PERSON> said he could not comment on whether the <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> has a higher rollover rate than its competitors, but said utility vehicles generally have a fatality rate three times that of light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that rollovers account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility vehicles. <PERSON> DeFore </PERSON> said drivers of utility vehicles such as the Samurai tend to be younger and more adventurous than the average driver of a passenger car, and therefore are more prone to accidents. In its statement, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said that in all of the accidental deaths involving the car, police found that serious driver errors led to the accidents. The company also said it believes the attacks on the Samurai may have been triggered in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster public opinion against <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and perhaps the entire sport vehicle industry. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> also said it believes it has been targeted because the Samurai is the leading imported sport utility vehicle from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and has gained tremendous media attention because of its uniqueness and affordability. The company said it would continue trying to determine the original source of allegations against the vehicle and why the company is being singled out. It will then consider legal action, it said. The most famous vehicle rollovers involved the Jeep CJ5 and CJ7, which the Wrangler superseded in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in August, inherited liability for lawsuits seeking nearly $ 1.1 billion in damages caused by Jeep rollovers.

<TEXT>
 A 21-year-old Hollywood feud between scriptwriters and directors over who gets top credit for a movie is flaring anew over a tactic writers are using in their bitter strike against movie and TV producers. Negotiations between the writers' union and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, representing management, were scheduled to resume Friday, following an unsuccessful nine-hour session Wednesday. In making a separate labor peace with 80 small producers this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> used a contract that requires a film be credited to the writer rather than the director. The Directors Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Thursday threatened legal action against producers who sign the union's model contract, which also allows writers to encroach on directors' prerogatives in several other areas. The warning by the directors' guild, made in an advertisement published in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> trade journals, is the latest complication in the writers' 13-week strike, which has already forced delays in the start of fall television season. The writers' independent contract with small producers who have broken ranks with the management group gives writers `` possessory credit,'' the right to have their name associated with the film title. Other objectionable provisions, said directors' spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Warn </PERSON>, require `` meaningful consultation'' with the writer on choice of director, actors and location, and give the writer a voice on script changes made during filming. Warn declined to discuss possible legal action, other than to say directors' lawyers were studying the matter. The unions fought in court over possessory credit in 1967 and the directors won. <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> refused to comment on the directors' threat or the possessory credit issue. `` It shows their demands are not realistic,'' <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the producers, said of the writers. `` They're just as unrealistic when it comes to the residuals for one-hour shows and foreign production,'' he continued, referring to the two main issues in the strike. The independent producers who have signed independent contracts with the union employ only about 100 of the union's 3,000 active writers, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. The Writers Guild called the strike March 7, largely because the producers sought to reduce their compensation for reruns of one-hour television shows. With the demand for reruns of one-hour shows slipping, the producers sought to tie the writers' payments, called residuals, to a show's success in reruns.

 Stock prices turned downward Thursday, giving up some of their recent gains as interest rates rose. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 107.57 points Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped back 11.56 to 2,052.45. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by slightly less than 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 614 up, 888 down and 476 unchanged.

Interest rates rose in the credit markets, reversing a sharp decline Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts also noted an increase in British interest rates. That prompted many traders to sell stocks in order to cash in on the gains of the past two sessions, brokers said.
