<TEXT>
 A federal judge Wednesday temporarily halted logging on five timber tracts that is being contested by conservationists seeking to preserve the northern spotted owl in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s temporary restraining order came in response to a motion filed Tuesday by environmental groups fighting the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to log mature forests near spotted owl nests. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> director, said its district representatives had been told to notify logging companies to cease operations as soon as possible. A sixth tract affected by the judge's order has not yet been awarded. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, in reckless disregard for the spotted owl, selected these six timber sales as a target of opportunity to make their point through chainsaw justice,'' said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiffs. Rivers would not comment on <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s remarks. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, nine conservation groups sued the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to try to stop logging on publicly owned stands of old-growth timber that are habitat for the northern spotted owl. The environmental groups contend a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plan for spotted owls does n't protect the species. The plan, approved in December, said 374,000 acres of mature and old-growth timber in 13 national forests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> should be designated as owl habitat. That is in addition to the wilderness areas and other tracts protected from logging. The northern spotted owl lives in the remnants of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>'s ancient old-growth forests. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is being challenged in court over its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened or endangered species. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earlier this month lifted an injunction it earlier imposed on cutting timber near spotted owl nests on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> land in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The appeals court sent the case back to <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s court. A request to reinstate the injunction is pending before <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> set a Feb. 17 hearing on that motion. In response to the appeals court's injunction, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> cut its projected timber harvest on the former <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Railroad lands it manages in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> by about 25 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> announced the six timber tracts after the injunction was lifted.

<TEXT>
 The Guardian Angels say that with the backing of the director of two <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> movies and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> businessman they will start training recruits in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> next week _ despite official opposition. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>, leader of the New York-based group that wants to send civilian patrols into the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground, had threatened to abandon the plan unless the crime-fighting group could find training space. He said police and some government officials had `` dug their heels in'' and refused to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> to train in public places. Police and lawmakers have said law enforcement on the subways should be left to professionals, not civilians. After discussing the Angels' plight on a highly popular <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> television talk show, <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said Wednesday that he had received two offers of help _ from <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, owner of a chain of public recital halls throughout <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and from director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON>. Winner directed `` Death Wish'' and `` Death Wish II'', both starring <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> as a tough vigilante who settles the score with cold-blooded criminals. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> offered the Angels the use of a hall evenings `` with no strings attached'' for a three-month training course and Winner guaranteed that if there were any problems, he would pay for a training facility. `` It gives us a mandate to continue,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said. The Guardian Angels had also received hundreds of calls from people who offered gardens, rooms, attics and backyards for training, <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said. He said 60 young people, one-third of them women, had applied to become <PERSON> Angels </PERSON> and would on Monday begin a training program in basic self-defense, first aid, performing citizens arrests and `` human relations.'' `` We're going to give it a go for the three months of training, and hopefully by early May be able to produce a Guardian Angel unit of young men and young women from the greater <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> area to go down into the Underground and give you a permanent, regular presence of Guardian Angels,'' he said. Supporters of the Angels say a sharp rise in assaults and robberies in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s subway system indicate the 2.2 million passengers who use it every day ca n't be protected without deploying many more uniformed police. The Guardian Angels, who turn 10 years old on Monday, became famous for patroling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s subways and have branched out into 60 cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 A group of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers, hoping to `` deliver an olive branch of peace,'' have begun to build a medical clinic in rural <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, information received today from the veterans said. Although a number of veterans groups have returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the clinic at <LOCATION> Vung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tau </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is the first known development effort by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. A news release from the Veterans-Vietnam Restoration Project said a ground-breaking ceremony for the 10-room facility occurred Saturday with veterans <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Vietnamese medical official Dr. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> van Rep taking part. Plans call for a dozen veterans, who include carpenters, electricians and architects, to spend about 10 weeks building the clinic with their own hands. The cost of the project is estimated between $ 60,000 and $ 100,000. At the ceremony, the veterans said they had begun `` to deliver an olive branch of peace to the people of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' `` It is hoped the group's efforts may soften the hard edge of American policies towards <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and eventualy lead to a better understanding and improved relationships,'' the release said. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a 47-year-old computer software technician from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, served as a combat infantryman in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, saw <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> duty with the air force and is currently a building contractor.

<HEAD>Scientists Criticize Newspaper Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several government and university scientists contend a recent series of newspaper stories exaggerated the threat to humans from selenium in food. Executive Editor <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Favre </PERSON> of The Sacramento Bee, which published the series on Dec. 4-5, said the newspaper was `` confident of the accuracy of our reporting and of our analysis.'' The critics are led by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrauzer </PERSON>, a chemistry professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, who said the Bee stories `` needlessly raised fears concerning the safety of the foods we eat ...'' The stories, summarized in an account distributed to papers nationwide by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said selenium had been found in food from supermarkets across the nation at levels high enough to slowly poison millions of high-risk Americans such as the very young, the old and the chronically ill. <PERSON> Schrauzer </PERSON> criticized the stories for `` reporting doubtful data on the selenium levels of common foods'' and `` grossly exaggerating the toxicity of selenium ...'' Selenium, a natural element in soil, is essential to life in small concentrations but can be toxic at higher levels `` Reports contending that millions of Americans are at risk of selenium poisoning are unfounded and irresponsible,'' <PERSON> Schrauzer </PERSON> said, `` as are the claims that the foods regularly consumed by Americans contain unsafe levels of the element.'' The Bee reported that illnesses ranging from stomach upsets to death occurred in rural western residents who had been exposed to significant amounts of selenium. The newspaper said that at least one person, an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> rancher, died of the disease, while others suffered paralysis, loss of hair, skin rashes, hypertension and other maladies attributable to selenium. <PERSON> Favre </PERSON> said the newspaper believes its stories were accurate and hopes `` that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and other government agencies will not turn their backs on a potential health hazard'' because of any dispute over the Bee's data. `` The laboratories the Bee used in the testing process are recognized by many states as among the finest labs for this type of test. We are confident that the results they found and which we published are accurate.'' The Bee said it hired private laboratories to study the selenium content in foods in `` dry weight'' form, with all moisture removed. The newspaper then figured average daily intake by translating the dry weights into equivalents of fresh foods as they would be consumed. The scientists criticizing those articles have focused principally on the calculations which the Bee used to translate the dry weights into average meals, rather than on the selenium levels found in tests conducted for the Bee. Bee reporter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who wrote the stories, defended the use of dry-weight calculations, saying there has been a `` dramatic evolution'' in the scientific community's opinions on which system to use, and that the once-universal wet-weight method is giving way to the more scientifically accurate dry-weight system. A major problem with wet-weight calculations, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, is that they lead to underestimation of intake. But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jukes </PERSON>, a biophysics professor at <ORGANIZATION> UC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>, who says he participated in the discovery that selenium was essential to life, said the stories `` need to be scrutinized and revised based on the actual content of selenium in foods, which they miscalculated.'' <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fan </PERSON>, chief of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' office of food toxicology in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, also said the Bee's assessment of dietary selenium intake `` is not consistent with scientific literature for the last 10 to 15 years <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, supervising chemist of the federal <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office, said the Bee's conclusions were `` without scientific merit.'' `` There is no evidence to suggest millions of people are getting too much selenium in their diet,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. The primary problem with the story, he said, was not the Bee's data, but its `` misleading'' interpretation of that data The story used an example of a person eating 6 ounces of dry eggs in a meal, implying that 6 ounces would be a normal serving, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. But the fresh equivalent of 6 ounces is 11 extra-large eggs, a 10-fold exaggeration of what someone would consume at a typical meal, he said. `` Similar reductions in calculated intakes can be made for other foods from -LRB- the Bee -RRB- article ...,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he based the formula for determining how much someone would consume in dry-weight equivalents on information gathered from several credible scientists and nutritionists, and that his data indicates that 6 ounces dry weight would equal 2 -LCB- to 3 extra large fresh eggs. However, nutritionist <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>, who was not consulted by the Bee and is not among critics who have come forward, said that 6 ounces of dry eggs are equivalent to 12 extra-large fresh eggs.

 The Plaza Hotel was in for a jolt when four mopheads from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> settled in a 12th floor suite for a short winter's stay in February 1964. They dove into room service: J & amp; B Scotch with <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>. They binged on `` jam butties'' -LRB- butter and jelly sandwiches -RRB-, corn flakes and ice cream, and left bowls full of stubbed out `` ciggies.'' The first morning, 37 sacks of mail arrived. And girls. Lots of girls. Screaming, screeching, silly schoolchildren who would kill their grandmothers for a glimpse of <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON>. The lasses dressed as chambermaids and tried to sneak into the suite. They posed as record company representatives. Anything. They stormed the hotel's revolving doors only to be dumped unceremoniously on the street with legions of their shrieking sisters. It was the first magical mystery tour for The Beatles. They landed at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Feb. 7 to make their legendary first appearance on `` The Ed Sullivan Show'' on Feb. 9. For 15 days, the country became inflamed with Beatlemania, and it would be years before the fever would die down. They were cocky and sure at their news conferences. At one, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was asked how much money he expected to earn during the tour. His response: `` About half a crown. Depends on the tax. How much have you got?'' And to what did they owe their success? `` Good press agent,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> was asked what he thought of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>. His reply: `` Great. ` Specially his poems. It was a lark. No one at that moment realized the rich gift and legacy to emerge from the four musicians. They went on to sell more than any group in pop history. Indeed, after their appearance on `` The Ed Sullivan Show,'' the Beatles sold 2.5 million records in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in less than a month. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> is dead now, shot outside his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> lives with his second wife, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>, and 9-year-old son, <PERSON> Dhani </PERSON>, in a fortress-like Gothic mansion with spires and turrets at <LOCATION> Henley-on-Thames </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He has lived out of the limelight for nearly 20 years, but reemerged somewhat in 1987 to give his first full concert in 15 years in July at <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> and to record a hit single, `` Got My Mind Set On You,'' which topped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Cash Box music chart in January 1988. He also has recorded with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> in a tongue-in-cheek group known as the Traveling Wilburys, and he is co-owner and an executive producer of the independent British film company, <ORGANIZATION> Handmade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` The Missionary,'' `` Life of Brian'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> spent five weeks in an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> alcoholism clinic last fall with his wife, actress <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>. They live in a secluded estate near <LOCATION> Ascot </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He became the first Beatle grandfather when his 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Zak </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON>, eldest of three children from his first wife, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, became a father on Sept. 7, 1985. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> is working on an album, which includes some songs co-written by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, to be released later this year. He has too many commitments to consider the 25th anniversary, his spokesman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> said. `` There have been a number of anniversaries in recent years. There will be lots of anniversaries coming up. He's still very busy making music. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said in a live radio phone-in on the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> last month that the Beatles will never be revived because `` to find a replacement for <PERSON> John </PERSON> is impossible.'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> has four children. His family lives on a fortified forest estate in <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. But in 1964, the Beatles had scarcely begun. Although wildly popular on the continent, the fabulous four and their records did not catch on in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until Jan. 17 when `` I Want to Hold Your Hand'' hit No. 1 on the Cashbox chart. Within a year, they grossed $ 1.6 million in the first week's showing of their movie, `` A Hard's Day Night,'' and <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s kooky book, `` In His Own Write,'' climbed best seller lists overnight In rapid succession, they made six hit albums, including 1967's anthem to the Summer of Love, `` Sgt. <ORGANIZATION> Peppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lonely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Sgt. Pepper'' sold 2.5 million records in its first three months and stayed on the charts for a staggering 113 weeks. Capitol Records estimates the album's worldwide sales at 15 million since 1967. This alternately melancholy, terrifying and exhilarating record captured as no other the complex textures of its time: a supercharged, corrosively contradictory summer when hippies grooved at the Monterey Pop Festival, black emotions exploded in riots in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and a war grew bloodier in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Youthful listeners somehow heard all of this in `` Sgt. Pepper,'' an album whose themes included Eastern culture, sweet and terrifying psychedelic fantasies, the widening gulf between young and old and, above all, loneliness. `` To me, the Beatles created an excitement about being in the business itself,'' says songwriter and performer <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>. `` They stick out to me as the greatest thing in pop music. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> has always been, and remains, my biggest influence of all time because of song structure. He and <PERSON> John </PERSON> taught me how to write songs.'' Cross, who won four Grammy Awards in 1981 for his song and LP, `` Sailing,'' was 12 when he saw the Beatles on `` Ed <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>.''

 The CBS press release heralding the Beatles' first appearance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was, in retrospect low-keyed. It identified them as `` The Beatles of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'' _ a `` wildly popular quartet of English recording stars.'' They were billed on the show with the comedy team of <PERSON> Mitzi </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>, impressionist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorshin </PERSON>, a tumbling act called the four Fays and 37 members of the cast from the Broadway musical, `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, more animated than usual, handled the squealing audience as a father would a hyperactive child. He gently shushed them and made the girls promise to stay in their seats. He told the audience <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> had sent a wire wishing the Beatles `` a tremendous success'' in our country, introduced a commercial for Aero Shave and then swept his arm through the air as the curtain parted. There was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 21, wide-eyed and boyish, feverishly working the bass guitar and singing `` All My Loving'' at one microphone. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 20, was on lead guitar. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 23, on rhythm guitar, harmonized at another microphone. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON>, 23, sat high above them on a platform, pounding out beats on the drums. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> soloed on `` Til There Was You'' from the Broadway show, `` The Music Man.'' Later, after a magician did card tricks and <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> sang songs from `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>,'' the Beatles returned with the <LOCATION> Lennon-McCartney </LOCATION> song, `` She Loves You.'' They were fresh and school boy neat in their Edwardian jackets, shirts and ties. Their hair, considered outrageously long at the time, fell in agreeable bangs across their foreheads and stopped somewhere mid-neck. The Beatle hair style eventually became as conservative as a crewcut. After the <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> show, the Beatles played the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Coliseum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> On Feb. 12, they played Carnegie Hall, where fans drowned their music in screams. Three years later, the Beatles began to show signs of weariness and drifting apart. Exhausted from years of concert touring, <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> had each done some independent film work; <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> met his future wife, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> art gallery in 1967, around the time they recorded `` Sgt. Pepper.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> went off to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to study sitar under <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON>. Two months after `` Sgt. Pepper'' was released, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, the Beatles' manager and stabilizing influence, died. With him went much of the spirit that had held the group together. In 1970, a year after the critically acclaimed `` Abbey Road'' was released, <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> came out with a solo LP and a self-interview critical of the other Beatles. The LP and movie, `` Let It Be,'' came out and by the end of the year, the group dissolved.

 A bare light bulb throws rays of hope on the faces of some of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake children who now study math and the virtues of communism inside a tent. For the 20 fourth graders in a green army tent that is now <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s School No. 7, school bells are ringing again. The corpses and the coffins are gone. So are sobbing relatives and the rescue workers who searched for the living amid the dead. A coal-fired furnace in the tent offers warmth. The children and other survivors do n't need to look far for reminders of Dec. 7, the day two months ago that the earth shook and introduced a new lesson _ one on survival. Their former school lies in ruins just over a hill. They are among tens of thousands of people who never left the area, or have returned since the earthquake smashed northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with a blow measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Of the half-million people left homeless, 100,000 women, children and the elderly were evacuated. Those who remain are trying to cope. Some complain the government is not doing enough to help them get clothes and solid roofs over their heads. Others doubt the reconstruction will be finished in two years, as authorities promise. Still others alleged that government officials were keeping donated relief goods for themselves. Those who remain live in tents, mobile homes and the few remaining habitable buildings. They shop for food in surprisingly well-stocked stores and receive government benefits. After recovering 25,000 bodies _ 15,000 in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> alone _ workers have moved on to clearing and rebuilding. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says the quake cost $ 16.1 billion. Broken concrete and twisted pipes have been dumped along roads leading to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. `` We Will Build Up Our Native <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> in Two Years,'' vows a sign at one city entrance, placed under a bronze bust of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the founder of the Soviet state for whom the city was named. About 100 construction workers are building themselves temporary dormitories in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said his Siberian brigade hopes to finish the dorms by the end of February, and start on homes for the general population. Among those hoping for permanent quarters are Asmik Tosunyan and three other people living in a one-room mobile home donated by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The 6-foot-by-18-foot room has just one mattress, two chairs and a propane stove, but no electricity or running water. <PERSON> Narina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ophsepyan </PERSON>, 18, was not so lucky. Since the earthquake toppled her nine-story apartment building and killed her parents, she has lived in an unheated tent with no water. `` I asked for a house but they said, ` Where are we going to find one?''' she said as she shivered on a Leninkan street. She and several other residents of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, the city closest to the epicenter, complained they have received none of the millions of dollars' worth of clothing donated from abroad and other Soviet republics. She accused `` the bosses'' of keeping it for themselves, or selling it. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodzhamiryan </PERSON>, a deputy premier of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said there is n't enough clothing to go around. Asked about the charges, he said: `` Everywhere there are bad people.'' Officials say 6 million square yards of housing must be built, more than 2 million in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> itself. New schools and factories also are planned. `` They say it will be done in two years, but God knows when they actually will finish,'' said an angry <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> man without a job and home who refused to give his name. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshitilov </PERSON>, a Soviet construction minister and head of the <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> branch of a government earthquake commission, said it is `` completely realistic'' to build minimal housing and social facilities in two years, but he acknowledged complete restoration will take longer. Officials insist construction will be monitored carefully to prevent shoddy workmanship, which officials says contributed to the death toll. A commission is investigating why many new buildings collapsed in the quake, while older structures were only damaged. New buildings will be no higher than four stories and located away from heavy seismic areas, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krivov </PERSON>, deputy chairman of a committee on architecture and city building. More detailed building codes, like those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are being drawn and construction workers will be required to follow them scrupulously, he said. <PERSON> Norik </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muradyan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, lost 11 relatives in the disaster and said officials are taking no chances in reconstruction. `` We know now that quality, that's life,'' <PERSON> Muradyan </PERSON> said in his makeshift office, a trailer donated by the British. `` Because of that, we are obliged not only to rush, but also to inspect everything.'' Slipshod practices are evident, however. Along railroad tracks, wooden building panels and plasterboards are stacked high, warping in the weather and unprotected from rain and snow that could cause rot. Authorities have determined it wo n't be safe to rebuild on the site where <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> stood, at the confluence of three quake faults. The city, where 23,000 lived and 3,200 died in the quake, will be rebuilt a few miles to the southwest. Today, the old city appears frozen in time, a museum of horror. Hundreds of collapsed houses lie where they fell, seemingly untouched since Dec. 7 in the shadow of beautiful, snow-covered mountains. Eventually the rubble will be cleared and a park, small factories and railroad station may be built there, officials said. But for now, all energy is being poured into the new location, a picturesque valley with fresh bulldozer tracks on recently cleared fields. A sign at a tent city for construction workers proclaims it `` our human duty'' to rebuild <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Muradyan </PERSON> takes the proclamation to heart and says his work is good therapy. `` When you are left alone, there is always grief _ both in your soul and mind _ and tears in your eyes,'' he said softly. `` But when you are working for the sake of children and their future and for the sake of your homeland, you must put everything aside and work like a devotee to your people.''

<HEAD>Bush Budget Has Nod to Campaign Promises, but Defers Tough Decisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tonight unveils a budget plan keyed to his campaign promises of `` kinder and gentler'' programs without new taxes, but it leaves difficult decisions on reducing the federal deficit for later. The president, in a 9 p.m. EST speech before a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will call for a nation more competitive abroad and more compassionate at home. To those ends, he will propose more federal spending in fiscal 1990 for clean air and clean coal technology, for science and space, for AIDS research and aid to the homeless, education and child care, according to administration and congressional sources. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims that those costs will be offset by about $ 4 billion in new revenue from a controversial cut in the capital gains tax _ another campaign promise _ and $ 2 billion by holding the expansion of the military budget to the rate of inflation. `` You will have a very detailed and precise descriptions of the priorities of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the White House press secretary. Left deliberately unclear, however, will be how much <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embraces the many budget cuts he left unchanged from the first-draft spending plan former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted last month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will distance himself from any of the individual, unpopular cuts by inviting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help set each program level in accordance with his `` flexible freeze'' plan to limit overall spending in general categories. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggested terminating dozens of domestic programs and cutting back many others in order to reduce the deficit below the $ 100 billion maximum allowed by the Gramm-Rudman law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s calculations include the total savings from those <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cuts in contending that he, too, is meeting the deficit target. He may claim a deficit as low as $ 90 billion by including sales of government assets that do not count toward the Gramm-Rudman goal, said one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers briefed Wednesday by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan proposes lumping programs together in `` boxes,'' within which some would have to be cut in order to expand others. Democrats did n't wait for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech to begin criticizing his plan to cut the capital gains tax, saying it is a tax break for the rich and will increase the deficit, not reduce it as the president claims. `` At a time when virtually every segment of our country is being asked to sustain a sacrifice of one form or another ... it is simply unacceptable to be considering tax breaks for the very wealthiest segment,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Many private economists dispute <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim that the rate cut will increase government revenues by spurring business investment and activity. Nonetheless, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget will claim about $ 4 billion in new revenue from the plan, which would be implemented gradually and eventually cut the rate to 15 percent for productive assets held for two years or more. Capital gains now are taxed at either 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil man, also will propose new tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. Additional energy production in selected offshore areas and in the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> wildlife refuge _ both opposed by environmentalists _ also are part of the plan, sources said. Other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals aimed at business and trade growth will include: _ Restoring a research and development tax credit for business _ Urban enterprise zones, using special tax breaks to lure companies to depressed areas _ Expanded support of research and science, including the space station and shuttle and the proposed superconducting supercollider physics laboratory <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will focus part of his speech and proposals on the environment, promising more spending on the Superfund program for toxic waste clean-ups, clean coal technology, clean water and wetlands programs, and a greater emphasis on global environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect. A few selected domestic programs in his budget would be increased as part of his `` kinder, gentler nation'' promise. Sources said they include: _ Increasing the <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> preschool education program by $ 250 million _ A merit award program for schools, and increased subsidies for black colleges _ A renewed and expanded tax credit for adoption, two years after the 1986 tax bill eliminated a deduction to offset those costs _ Rejection of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed $ 1.7 billion cut in the Medicaid health program for the poor _ A child care tax credit of $ 1,000 for low-income families _ Full funding of the <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> homeless assistance act _ $ 25 million to start a national program for youth in public service. _ Increased spending for the battle against drug abuse, although not the full amount authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ Increased spending on AIDS research The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget revisions will also reflect the $ 1.9 billion cost to the taxpayer next year of his program to bail out the ailing savings and loan industry. He'll also embrace <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plans for upgrading aviation safety, and add $ 350 million to the $ 1.4 billion <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought for clean-ups needed at the government's nuclear plants, the sources said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to increase military spending 2 percent over inflation in fiscal 1990. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will propose an inflation-only increase next year, with a 1 percent increase over inflation in 1991 and a 2 percent increase in 1993. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will revise <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic assumptions slightly to reflect his higher projection for short-term interest rates in 1989 than the 6.3 percent projected in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget. Since taking office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his budget chief <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> have been urging <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> leaders to join in high-level budget talks to shortcut the balky congressional budget process. Under regular procedures, the president's budget gets modified by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into a final budget resolution, which then serves as an overall guide for legislation produced later by the appropriations and tax-writing committees.

<HEAD>Cyprus Fans Attack Scots After Close Match, Injure Referee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 angry Cypriot soccer fans besieged the winning Scottish team after a World Cup qualifying match, stoning the <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION>' locker room and injuring nine people, police said. Four Cypriot fans were arrested on rioting charges in the violence that erupted after the <ORGANIZATION> Glasgow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> scored a goal to clinch a 3-2 victory in the final 10 seconds of a see-saw game. A police spokesman said club-swinging riot squads broke up the mob after fans started hurling cans and stones at the locked metal doors of the Scottish team's locker room at <LOCATION> Tsirion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in this southern port. The spokesman said the team later drove straight to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> under police escort. Police said eight officers were injured and the East German referee was `` slightly injured'' when he was punched by a mental patient on parole as he followed the players off the field. One police car and a bus were damaged, witnesses said. There were no reports of injuries or arrests among an estimated 1,500 Scottish fans who flew in for the game.

<HEAD>Farmers Able to Borrow Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers are able to borrow money again, and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it's a good sign that the battered agricultural economy is well on its way to recovery. `` The large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders appears to be over, and debt is expected to grow 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in 1989,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Farm loan demand strengthened in the past year and should continue to expand in 1989.'' Moreover, the agency said Wednesday in a report, commercial banks that specialize in farm finance are doing well compared with the mid-1980s. By last summer, their returns on equity were up 40 percent from 1987 and more than 150 percent above 1986. `` The improving farm economy will save more agricultural banks from failure in 1989,'' the report said. `` Failures, after setting a post-Depression record of 75 in 1987, fell to 41 in 1988, and may be the same to sharply fewer in 1989.'' Total bank failures, including agricultural institutions, may `` be closer to 100'' in 1989 instead of more than 200 in each of the previous two years, the report said. At the height of the recent financial crunch, as plummeting land values cut sharply into assets, thousands of farmers owed so much that they could n't qualify for additional credit to pay bills. With the lid on further credit, farmers often liquidated or culled livestock herds, sold commodities held in storage and took other steps to reduce debts. As this paydown took effect, banks and other lending institutions have eased back. As a result, the report said `` creditworthy farmers should have ample access to operating credit'' for spring planting and other production expenses this year. `` Farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despite the -LRB- 1988 -RRB- drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farm recovery,'' the report said. Major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988 and fewer farm loan delinquencies, loan charge-offs and foreclosures, it said. An exception was the department's <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which makes loans to the least creditworthy producers, but `` indications are that it too is coming to grips'' with its problems, the report said. A major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this year was said to be the continued strength in crop and livestock commodity sales. `` Better economic fundamentals also underlie long-run trends in agriculture,'' the report said. `` Farmland markets have improved and the farm sector balance sheet -LRB- of assets and liabilities -RRB- has stabilized.''

 Farm and ranch inventories of cattle and calves edged down again to a 28-year low of 99,484,000 head on Jan. 1 from 99,524,000 a year ago, according to new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates. But the decline has slowed and there were indications many beef producers have started rebuilding their herds. A year ago, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle herd was down 2.4 percent from the 102 million head that had been estimated Jan. 1, 1987. This year's decline was less than 1 percent. `` This slowed the recent downtrend in cattle inventories that began six years ago and was the second consecutive inventory below 100 million head since 1961,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The estimate was in line with recent predictions of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts, who say the shrinkage in the overall cattle herd may be starting to rebound. As producers hold back breeding stock to rebuild herds, beef output is expected to decline in the short run. Overall, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts, 1989 beef production may decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year to the lowest level since 1980. But large supplies of pork and poultry are expected and that could leave this year's total meat output at only slightly below the record level of 1988. Even so, retail beef prices are expected to set records this year. As of Jan. 1, the number of beef cows and heifers that have calved totaled 43.9 million head, up 1 percent from a year ago, the first increase following six consecutive years of decline. Beef cows were reported at 33.7 milion head, up 2 percent from Jan. 1, 1988, and dairy cows at 10.2 million head, down 1 percent. It was the smallest inventory of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk cows since 1872, the report said. The 1988 calf crop was estimated at almost 40.9 million head, up 2 percent from 1987. Analysts said the value of all cattle and calves as of Jan. 1 was estimated at about $ 60.4 billion, up 16 percent from $ 52 billion a year earlier. The average value was reported at $ 607 per head, compared with $ 523 the previous year.

 An annual inventory report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shows that the nation's flock of sheep and lambs increased slightly in 1988 for the third consecutive year. The increase was only a small fraction of 1 percent, however, boosting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flock to an estimated 10,802,000 sheep and lambs on Jan. 1 from 10,784,000 on Jan. 1, 1988. Despite the recent gains, the Jan. 1 count was one of the smallest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records going back for more than a century. In 1970, for example, there were 20.4 million sheep and lambs in the nation's flocks. And in 1867, when <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> began counting sheep, there were about 46.3 million head. The industry peaked in 1942 at 56.2 million. `` Primarily the decline stems from less demand for wool as more synthetics and cheaper substitute materials were introduced and the declining demand for lamb in consumer diets,'' the report said.

 <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>, educated in a one-room schoolhouse near <LOCATION> Downers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was 17 and dreaming of becoming a doctor in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when she met an African revolutionary at a summer church camp. He changed her life. It was 1951, and <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>, who became the founder and first president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was 31 and lecturing at church camps as part of his scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Oberlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` I am a product of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>,'' says his widow, 55, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, still wracked by war and famine 14 years after independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and 20 years after her husband's assassination. `` I grew up in this little town near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Until I was 7 I lived out in the country,'' the former <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> recalled in an interview. `` Life was calm, very stable, not many ideas were passing through.'' She said, `` <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> was able to write on a blank sheet and he wrote on it until the time he died.'' On Feb. 3, 1969, <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> was killed by a parcel bomb at his office in <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, where the revolutionary movement _ known by its <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym, <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> _ was headquartered during the war against the Portuguese. `` During the whole long struggle every now and then you had to pick up the children and leave the house in the middle of the night because word came that someone was coming to attack,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> said. `` I'm not at all a violent person. As a matter of fact I'm rather a pacifist. But my life has been very much linked with war, unfortunately.'' Her work as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> involves providing emergency aid for millions of refugees displaced by fighting between the <LOCATION> Frelimo </LOCATION> government, which took power in 1975 under a Marxist constitution, and guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance, supported for many years by the white-minority governments of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and what then was <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> said she is not a Marxist but is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a deputy in the People's Assembly, the national legislature. Today's <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is not what she had expected, she said. `` I never counted on so much war, that's for sure. We thought that it would be possible to develop the country.

It's a question of do you break these ties or do n't you, really throw in the lot or not? `` I decided yes, this is really my country. I really dedicated my life to this country since I met <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>, and that's a long time ago. `` I went to the church camp in -LRB- <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and there was <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Soon after Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was ousted in a coup, residents of the working class neighborhood `` Barrio Stroessner'' strung some rope around the neck of a statue of the dictator and pulled it down. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s cult of personality, which in 34 years saw a city, international airport and even a popular polka named after him, is crumbling as Paraguayans try to erase remnants of the man who was ousted Friday by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. At President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> International Airport, an employee using a spatula and bucket of warm water worked to remove the ubiquitous posters of the one-time president and `` Only Leader,'' as he often was described. Gone, too, is the large flashing neon sign that for years at night blinked out in red letters the message `` Stroessner: Peace, Work and Well-Being'' from atop the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> next to a downtown park. Government employees still slip and refer to `` President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'' instead of `` President <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>,'' but the ever-present photos of the stocky, shrewd ex-army commander-in-chief have disappeared from their offices. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ultima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hora </ORGANIZATION> offered a tongue-in-cheek sale of `` framed pictures and paintings in various sizes, poses and expressions of a known ex-military president.'' `` The offer is limited and will not be repeated,'' the phony ad said. The Roman Catholic Church-run Radio Caritas held a poll to determine what new name to use for the airport, the neighborhood `` Barrio Stroessner'' and the city <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, located about 200 miles east of the capital across the <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. One caller suggested the airport be dubbed `` Freedom Airport''; another, `` February 3rd Airport'' to mark the day of the coup. Others suggested `` Barrio Stroessner'' become `` Barrio <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II'' to commemorate the pope's visit to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> in May. Government officials are reluctant to criticize the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> years too harshly, telling reporters they prefer to look to the future. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> himself set the tone Monday by saying his former boss and friend `` was not a dictator.'' `` The <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> government had different stages and within those stages there were 32 or 33 years of a great government,'' says new Foreign Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>. The public reaction is more varied and harder to gauge, but as opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> notes acerbicly, few in the army stood by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in his moment of need, no one rallied to his side while he remained a prisoner in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, and the majority of people who saw him off at the airport were there to jeer. `` There's no doubt about it, the majority of the people are euphorically enchanted,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, 19 years ago to serve in <LOCATION> Colonel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION>, a city 80 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. `` It will take a couple of weeks until they are over this.'' That view is not unanimous. A parking lot attendant said: `` He was a good man. We'll have to wait to see what comes next.'' But interviews with Paraguayans like <PERSON> Hilaria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> indicated why the end of a 34-year authoritarian was almost an anticlimax. `` Now you can talk and nobody will arrest you,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, a vegetable vendor who carries carrots, onions and spinach door-to-door on her head. `` I think Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s coup was a magnificent act,'' she said. `` I would like to vote for the general for president in the next elections.''

 To the delight of Republicans and discomfort of some Democrats, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is back in the political spotlight, campaigning for the once-obscure post of chair of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic Party. The political comeback of the former governor and two-time presidential candidate follows six years of self-imposed political exile _ part of it spent in seclusion writing in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and part working in <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s hospital in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> and on a CARE hunger project in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s latest campaign will conclude with voting Saturday among the 2,800 delegates credentialed for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic Party's annual convention. Another liberal <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, is expected to be named chairman of the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 50, once dubbed `` Gov. Moonbeam'' by his critics, has lined up endorsements from an impressive array of party leaders and is regarded as the favorite over investment banker <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Westly </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Westly </PERSON> is the current vice chair of the party and traditionally would be unopposed for chairman. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s critics note that as governor from 1975 through 1983, he shunned the party, and they contend he would use the chair's office not to serve the party but as a stepping stone to advance his own political career. They also say one of his weaknesses as governor was neglect of the sort of administrative detail that is a major part of the state chair's job, and that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election would give new life to what have become stale Republican attacks against controversial aspects of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s governorship, from Medflies to his appointment of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> as chief justice. Ms. <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> was recalled by voters in 1986, largely because of her opposition to the death penalty. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledges and dismisses such criticism, saying that the 18 primary and general election campaigns he has conducted over the past two decades give him the experience, contacts and fund-raising ability to revitalize the party. `` I think that issue of negative baggage is overstated. People do n't replay history forever,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says, making jokes exaggerating his past political problems. `` I guess I feel a little bit like <PERSON> Typhoid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>,'' he joked in one interview shortly after announcing his candidacy late last year. `` I walk in and people want to step back a little. Ohhhhh boy, it's going to be <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, death penalty, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, Farm Workers, Whewww! But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s image is not a joke to some Democrats. `` He has too much baggage to help the party recoup,'' says Assemblyman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasconcellos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, a Democrat generally supportive of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> during his governorship. And Assemblyman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Democrat who has formed an exploratory committee for a race for lieutenant governor in 1990, does n't want <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to become a fresh campaign issue. `` I do n't see any evidence that he's changed. What has <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> done in the last six years to show he's in touch with the people of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>? He seems to think he has to go to <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> to see people in need,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says his goals will be to rebuild what he describes as a decaying <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, particularly in fund-raising, and he says that goal, not his own career, will be his focus as chairman. But if he succeeds in strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the people now criticizing his bid will want him to run for office, but he adamently declines to specify any future office. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has gone out of his way in his comeback bid to admit past mistakes. In a long introspective article he wrote for The <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Bee the week before formally announcing his campaign for chair, he specifically addressed his rocky relationship with the party he now wants to lead. `` One thing I did not do -LRB- as governor -RRB- is build a strong <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or even an enduring political organization. I knew where I was going, but too often I was going there by myself,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wrote. `` I had become so immersed in campaigning and running that I neglected the people around me.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledges that his bid for the unpaid post of party chairman is his bid to re-enter politics, but he denies that his re-entry will be at the expense of the party. And he pledges to serve the full four-year term, which presumably would take him out of 1992 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or presidential races. `` I'm back, back to build the party, and back to stay,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told convention delegates in Red Bluff last week.

 As thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teen-agers struggle with the complexities of basic algebra, a 17-year-old English girl is being wooed by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and several other universities to lecture and continue her mathematical research on such subjects as quantum groups and statistical mechanics. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is manipulating some of the most complex concepts in mathematics. Her work has taken her to the outer fringes of theoretical physics and mathematics, such subjects as knot and string theory, and the connections between the world of particle physics and mathematics. She entered <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> six years ago and by age 13 had her degree. Today she is working on her doctorate and has long since caught the attention of the world's top mathematicians. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> has already taught students at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> on a tutorial basis. If she accepts a position at an American university it will be mainly to conduct research. But she said she might lead a seminar or deliver an occasional lecture. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> is interested in bringing <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> in for a year. It all began not in some exclusive British school but in <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s own home in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, where her father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, a computer consultant, gave <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> her entire pre-Oxford education. `` I was always dealing with adults so when I got to Oxford I fitted into the atmosphere. ... He did n't use any textbooks. He taught me totally himself,'' she said Wednesday while visiting Harvard with her father. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> got top scores on her <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> entrance exam. It was at that point, her father said, `` it was obvious to me that she was a little better than most.'' Once at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> studied under Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Atiyah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professor </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and `` one of the great mathematicians of the world,'' according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>, chairman of the mathematics department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, one of the schools recruiting <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> seems to have taken her rapid rise in stride. She is much more interested in talking about the vast unknown in the world of mathematics than dwelling on her accomplishments. `` When I was taught mathematics in the beginning I was interested in it. I just liked it. I did n't think it was anything special,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. Now, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> says, `` The age thing really does not matter for more than the first two seconds. ... I talk to mathematicians as mathematicians and I think they talk to me in the same way.'' <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>'s math chairman, has been tracking <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s career for the past seven years `` Word was certainly getting around in the mathematical field that there was this very unusual prodigy,'' <PERSON> Addison </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> just spent four weeks in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attending a prestigious mathematics conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. The discussion among scientists and mathematicians from around the world focused on the relationship between physics and mathematics, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s area of concentration. <PERSON> Addison </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> for a possible research position at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and found her `` a very nice person. Sometimes prodigies end up being kind of strange or egotistic. I did n't sense that.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said he taught his daughter at home so she could reach her highest potential. He is using the same method in teaching his other daughter, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, 15, who is something of a piano prodigy, with one <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> concert under her belt. To the inevitable question of whether <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> feels she has missed out on childhood she answers unequivocally: `` I've had a very enjoyable childhood. I've had so many opportunities I would n't have had if I'd gone the ordinary route.''

<TEXT>
 An environmental dispute between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> took a new twist when two legislators here decided to `` fight fire with firewater'' by proposing a ban on <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> liquor. State Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON> said he wanted to let <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> leaders know that their decision to stop a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> company from dumping wastewater into the <LOCATION> Pigeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would have economic ramifications in both states. `` I'm not trying to knock them to their knees,'' Winner said. `` The basic problem is they do n't think they have anything to lose.'' Winner and state Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> introduced a bill Wednesday that would ban the sale in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> of any liquor manufactured in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> or purchased from a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> vendor. `` There's no revenge involved,'' said <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, tongue in cheek. `` I just think ol' Tennessee liquor is bad for people.'' The bill is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter feud between the states over <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s refusal to grant <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> a permit to discharge wastewater into the <LOCATION> Pigeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at its <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> paper mill. The Pigeon flows from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, skirting the northeastern border of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. In response to concerns by residents of <LOCATION> Cocke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, officials in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> announced Dec. 23 they would not grant a variance allowing the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> plant to continue dumping into the river. A Champion official announced this week that operations at the mill would be scaled back as a result of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s decision, threatening the jobs of 1,000 people. Nonetheless, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> said the decision not to grant the variance is final. `` What <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> does, I guess, is <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s businesss,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, the spokesman `` About the only similarity between <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> whiskey and <LOCATION> Pigeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water is they're about the same color.'' The liquor bill quickly inspired jokes and puns in the halls of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Legislative Building, including talk of `` fighting fire with firewater.'' A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> estimated that more than 1 million bottles of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> whiskey are sold in the state each year. Winner said he chose to target <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> liquor to avoid conflicting with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution's provision forbidding states from restricting interstate commerce. The courts have ruled that the 21st Amendment allows states to regulate liquor traffic within their borders and that it supersedes the interstate commerce clause, he said. A spokesman for the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> distillery in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said he was only vaguely familiar with the Champion controversy, but the proposed liquor ban was troubling. `` We're not too happy, I do n't guess,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brashears </PERSON>. `` It do n't make us too pleased.''

 An anti-terrorist program is protecting the nation's electric power suppliers even though planners doubt a coordinated attack ever will be launched against the energy network, an industry official says. The program is about six months old and involves an `` ongoing working relationship'' with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michehl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gent </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing on Wednesday. He said the program, which was 2 -LCB- years in the making, was adopted even though `` skepticism was rampant'' among its creators that terrorists would carry out a multi-site attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy supplies. Natural events such as hurricanes present a greater threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power systems, said Gent, whose organization represents virtually all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian suppliers of electricity. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has been advising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies privately of a growing threat of `` techno-terrorism'' attacks on vital domestic energy facilities and it is pressing them to fortify their defenses. <PERSON> Gent </PERSON> said his group had agreed with <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials not to talk about the program because of fear of tipping off terrorists. He said his testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` is the first, and I hope the last, public utterance of our program.'' He said he would be willing to discuss specifics of the program in a closed committee session, which <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said could be done. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said oil and natural gas pipeline representatives had declined to appear before the panel out of fear that sensitive security information would be revealed. The committee concluded two days of hearings on the vulnerability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications and energy resources to terrorism. In testimony Tuesday, the committee was told the increasing sophistication of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications systems and their concentration at fewer sites made them more vulnerable to terrorist attack. The committee also was told the federal government was ill-prepared to deal with a terrorist assault on private communications. A DOE official Wednesday said that in the past two years his department `` has taken decisive steps to substantially strengthen and reorganize the nation's ability to respond to non-nuclear energy emergencies.'' Those steps include an Energy Emergency Management System within DOE and an <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vulnerability </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary for energy emergencies. `` We filled a vacuum,'' <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> said, adding that he wanted to ensure that `` we'd never have to go before this body or the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and say that we had information, even general information, that something was being perpetrated by enemies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on our energy infrastructure and we stood idly by and did n't do anything about it.'' He said <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>, like the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, put out `` several'' advisories in 1987 that there were foreign terrorist threats that could involve the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. `` I take the threat seriously, the potential threat seriously.,'' <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> said `` Since 1980 there have been approximately 8,000 attacks against energy systems around the world.

<HEAD>Bush's Rescue Plan Juggles Numbers for Sake of Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is sending <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a 30-year, $ 200 billion plan to rescue the savings and loan industry that is carefully crafted to avoid inflating the federal budget deficit next year. The proposal, submitted as part of the 1990 budget, spreads the costs over 30 years and shifts some of the budget outlays into the current 1989 fiscal year. As a result, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making it easer to keep his `` no new taxes'' pledge in the first year of his presidency by including an immediate $ 200 million savings in 1990. The president would spend only $ 1.9 billion in tax dollars in 1990 on the biggest government bailout ever, compared with $ 2.1 billion proposed by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for outlays of $ 18.5 billion in fiscal years 1990 through 1993, $ 3.1 billion more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would spend in his first four budgets. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would increase spending this year to $ 11.1 billion, up from $ 8.7 billion in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget. `` That is the accounting sleight of hand that is in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not that taxpayers are going to be paying any less, but that it shows up less on the budget.'' <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who devised the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan declined several requests for interviews Tuesday and Wednesday. The president's plan is complex. Tax revenue and increased deposit insurance premiums paid by banks and thrifts would be used to make good on $ 40 billion in assistance pledged by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators last year and to pay off $ 50 billion in additional money borrowed through 30-year bonds sold over the next three years. The Office of Management and Budget, a White House agency, this week released financing details showing $ 126 billion in spending from 1989 through 1999. According to the figures, the government would continue to spend $ 3.8 billion a year after that in interest on the bonds, bringing total spending to more than $ 200 billion over 30 years. The administration had said that solving the S & amp; L problem would cost $ 90 billion, but that amount did not account for the interest charges. Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the public would shoulder $ 40 billion of the cost over the first decade and 54 percent, or more than $ 100 billion, of the burden over 30 years. In the first decade, an additional $ 20 billion would be raised as an increase in the deposit insurance premiums paid by banks. The money would stay in the bank fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but would count as revenue in the general budget and allow the government to spend that amount in tax dollars without adding to the budget deficit. Private analysts make two criticisms of the president's proposal _ that it does n't provide enough money and that it's based on overly optimistic interest rate assumptions. `` I do n't think there is enough money in this plan, but I think it is a very good and substantial down payment,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, a banking expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can understand why they do n't want to acknowledge that now, but this is too little.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is assuming he can sell the 30-year bonds at an interest rate of 7.6 percent, nearly 1.5 percentage points lower than the current market. `` Of course it's a rosy scenario,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>'s visit to <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' bedside in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is widely seen as a bid to revive his dying political fortunes and angle for right-wing support as he seeks the presidency. On Saturday, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> carrying what he said were secret messages from the ailing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> appealed to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s `` Christian values'' to allow the ex-president to come home to die. But Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refused to see <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, reflecting the low esteem in which she holds the vice president. Furthermore, many political commentators accused Laurel of `` grandstanding'' in the sensitive national question of whether to allow the 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` The nakedness of <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s ambitions leaves little room for respect,'' wrote The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has become clear that the man is so obsessed with winning power that he would grab at straws to support his bid.'' Laurel has so little influence with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> that it seemed virtually impossible that he would be able to persuade her to relent and allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return home. The government says <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates embezzled up to $ 10 billion during his 20-year rule and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to discuss his return until he gives back the money. Several congressmen and political commentators believe <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> intended through the trip to ingratiate himself with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers, especially those in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> island, and use them as a base of support in the 1992 presidential campaign Inheriting the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> mantle would enable <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> to outflank other potential center-right candidates, such as Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who might appeal to those who would not support Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> or anyone seen as her favored candidate. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said she will not seek re-election. `` With the demise of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the so-called ` solid north' is in need of someone to rally around,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Florencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON>. The 60-year-old Laurel would seem an ideal `` reconciliation candidate'' to bring together a nation still deeply divided three years after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in a popular uprising. Laurel announced he would run for president against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1985, but stepped aside under pressure to become Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s running mate A member of an elite political clan, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> maintains links to the business community and the military. But a series of political blunders has reinforced his deeply entrenched public image as an opportunist. After a bloody August 1987 coup attempt, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> traveled to military bases, ostensibly to investigate soldiers' complaints. Before the television cameras, he would shout, `` Do you want Communists out of government?'' That brought cheers from the troops but contempt from more liberal-minded urban voters, who joked that <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> was becoming a `` Filipino <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>.'' In September 1987, he resigned as foreign secretary, citing widespread differences with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on the 20-year-old Communist insurgency and other issues. A year later, he demanded she resign and call new elections, but she refused. Instead of winning sympathy by his moves, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s popularity plunged. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers and television stations rarely report his activities and his speeches draw only modest audiences. Despite Laurel's personal campaigning, his nephew, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, was defeated in the January 1988 race for governor of <LOCATION> Batangas </LOCATION> province, the Laurel family stronghold. Since formally breaking with the administration in August, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to organize a broad-based opposition movement have faltered. He complained last year to foreign reporters that he was virtually ignored by the media. His principal public forum in the capital has been occasional interviews by Tagalog-language radio stations. `` It would be a gross understatement to say that <PERSON> Doy </PERSON> has an image problem,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Olaguer </PERSON>, referring to Laurel by his nickname.

 The husband of a comatose woman begged an appeals court to let him end his wife's pregnancy to save her life, and said in an interview that anti-abortionists who oppose him are `` ripping my guts out.'' `` I implore this court not to permit these two strangers to delay my decision,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said in an affidavit submitted to a state appeals court Wednesday. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a 34-year-old accountant from the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION>, wants to be named guardian of his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, so he can authorize an abortion that several doctors said could aid in her recovery. But anti-abortion activists <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> have sought to block him, saying that aborting the fetus will not improve Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s chances and will harm her psychologically. They have applied to become her guardian to prevent the abortion. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was awarded the guardianship Tuesday in a state trial court, but the decision was stayed pending an appeal by <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. At the appellate hearing, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON>, called Short and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> `` intruders, strangers'' with no right to decide Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s fate. But <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON>, <PERSON> Short </PERSON>'s attorney, countered that it was a conflict of interest for <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> to be named guardian. She said the abortion would violate his wife's wishes. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> `` had planned this pregnancy, she was looking forward to this pregnancy and was happy about it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. `` The issue is not the right to an abortion, but the right to procreate and have children.'' In his affidavit, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said: `` For nine years, my wife and I have lived a happy and devoted life together. I know her wishes and priorities, including her own survival and recovery in view of the welfare of our 3-year-old daughter.'' The five-judge appeals panel is due to make its decision by the end of the week. Short, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-to-Life </ORGANIZATION> group, pledged to take the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if the panel ruled against him. `` At least the fetus is one day older,'' <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. `` If we keep it going, she will be a newborn, alive child. If <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> dies and the baby lives, she will have an extension of herself in the baby.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> before the hearing, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> when he said: `` I just want to get this issue behind us. They're ripping my guts out.'' `` Everyone has a right to their beliefs,'' he added, `` but why do n't they ever talk about my wife, and about her life?'' He said he visits his wife daily at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhasset </LOCATION>, where she has been in a coma since a Dec. 13 car accident. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, is about 17 weeks pregnant. `` I tell her about friends who have called,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said, acknowledging that he's not sure his wife can understand him. `` I tell her about our daughter, and just generally about how my day went.'' `` I'm just taking one day at a time,'' he added. `` Inside, I'm tearing up, but I'm trying to keep a smile on my face Hopefully, everything will work out.'' In the lower court ruling, Judge <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said that `` as of this time an abortion is not medically necessary'' to save Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s life. But <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said the issue before the court was Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s constitutional rights If she were competent, he said, she would have the absolute right to an abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Five medical experts testified that pregnancy increased the risks for the comatose patient and could possibly threaten her life. But two medical experts testified the pregnancy was not life-threatening. Short has said he and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> are the only parties addressing the issue of Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s psychological health. `` Were she to recover, being told that her child is alive, psychologically, could only be a benefit,'' he said. `` Telling her that they killed her child, psychologically, could be a disaster.''

The new 37-year-old chief of the city's Taxi and <ORGANIZATION> Limousine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is moonlighting as a driver in hopes of setting new standards for courtesy and reminding drivers that hacking is a service industry. `` The riders have been terrific,'' <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> told a reporter who was invited to ride with him Wednesday. `` If you give people a good quality ride, they will pay for it.'' <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> was unfailingly polite and cheerful and tried to make eye contact with each passenger.

He said the agency's mandatory, three-week training program, which he completed, must be beefed up along with standards for the English proficiency test, which only 7 percent of applicants fail even though many are recent immigrants. And what about the traffic? `` I'm constantly impressed by the number of close calls,'' he said after slamming on the brakes when a car stopped short in front of him.

 The seven impersonators all would be `` The King,'' and they did their best to keep alive the memory of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> at a downtown tavern. `` I'm a big Elvis fan,'' said security guard <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, 27, who appeared at the weekly amateur show Tuesday at Choice's bar. `` He was an original. He introduced sex into music. It was sad later in his life when he got fat and into drugs, but in his prime he was one of the best.'' The impersonators sang `` Do n't Be Cruel'' and other Presley tunes and ate one of his favorite snacks, jelly doughnuts, to celebrate the singer's amazing popularity 11 -LCB- years after his death. `` I wish he was alive,'' said bartender <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, 25. `` His music is not going to die.'' <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> and Fanning each sported a pompadour, white jumpsuit, cape and boots. They arrived at the bar in a limousine with two other impersonators who wore sunglasses and Hawaiian leis. Among the other impersonators was six-year-old <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, who sang `` Blue Suede Shoes'' and tried his best to look like <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 29, said she's a big <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan but her son is `` even a bigger fan.'' `` That's all he listens to,'' she said, `` my Elvis records.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 81 billion plan to modernize and clean up nuclear weapons plants over 20 years would save the nation's production of war devices but fail to remove all environmental hazards, the head of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Modernization activities would essentially be completed by 2010, and the nation would have a revitalized weapons complex,'' Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> told a congressional hearing Wednesday. `` However, problems in the environmental area would still be with us.'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> it would take up to $ 155 billion over 30 years to modernize the industry, clean up closed plants and protect the environment from radioactive contamination. Material for nuclear weapons is produced at reactors and other facilities in a dozen states, but has effectively stopped because of safety concerns at reactor sites in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Energy officials told another congressional committee last week they hope to get the tritium-producing reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> site in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> back in operation before the end of the year, but may not be able to do it that soon. The reactor has been out of operation since August when an unexplained power surge caused it to shut down and other potential hazards were discovered. The Energy Department, in an unsigned statement submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, said the department `` has produced and maintained an effective nuclear deterrent that is the cornerstone of our national defense.'' But the department acknowledged that past decisions have focused on meeting short-term national security needs rather than environmental and safety concerns. It said the practice at many of the facilities of dumping waste into open, unlined pits and ponds has led to `` a major challenge in restoring the soil and groundwater underlying some inactive waste sites.'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, in his testimony, said, `` In our opinion, the -LRB- department's -RRB- plan does not adequately address the cleanup of existing facilities and decontamination of facilities as they are retired from service.'' He said if problems affecting the nuclear complex are not addressed soon, `` the country's ability to produce and maintain a nuclear weapons arsenal is in serious jeopardy.'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said the major difference between his congressional watchdog agency's estimate of $ 105 billion to $ 155 billion and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimate of $ 81 billion to modernize and clean up the plants is over how much it will take to decontaminate and protect the environment. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said the nuclear weapons complex is `` one of the more potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world'' and some nuclear production sites may be `` irreversibly contaminated.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to spend $ 315 million in fiscal 1990 on environmental cleanup represent `` only a small down payment'' on the $ 40 billion to $ 70 billion needed.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 that crashed in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, killing all 144 people aboard, had recorded no serious mechanical problems and relatively few flight hours for a 20-year-old jet, officials said. The craft, one of two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707s owned by <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had logged 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and less than 50,000 hours in the air. `` If properly maintained, there should not be a problem because of hours or number of cycles,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Other aircraft involved in the news have had as much as 50,000 cycles, a great many more.'' The Caribbean-bound charter jet, carrying 137 vacationers from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and a seven-member American crew, crashed into a fog-shrouded mountain Wednesday as it approached an airport in the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> archipelago for refueling. A.L. <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in this town 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, told reporters that for employees of the air charter service `` it's like losing a member of your family.'' `` Generally everybody knows everybody else in a company this size,'' <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said. `` There have been some tears here today in shock.'' The crew members were: <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, the captain; <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON>, 36, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, 1st officer; <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the flight engineer; and flight attendants <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, 24, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, 45, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromarty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and the captain were planning to be married May 20, according to her father, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The plane had seven service difficulty reports during the past six years, according to records at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s aeronautical center in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON> said. A report filed in January 1983 said the plane's No. 2 engine was shut down due to turbine failure. Another that month said a switch in the main landing gear failed and was replaced. Further details on the incidents were not immediately available, Ms. <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON> said. Two reports filed July 1987 showed problems with the plane's altimeter and air speed monitors In the latter case, the plane returned to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for repairs. The latest report, filed in December, indicated that during inspection a mechanic noticed a crack in an engine fan duct. The duct was replaced and the plane was returned to service. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said Wednesday night that he had not seen the reports and did not know their contents, but he said any faults with the plane would not be considered a problem, `` not if they've been repaired.'' He added that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had fined Independent Air $ 18,000 in 1984, but he did not know why. <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said one of the company's two jetliners lost oil pressure Jan. 21 as it flew into <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and was repaired for eight to 10 hours before it resumed flying. He did not know if the jet was the one that crashed Wednesday. `` I'm not aware -LRB- of the service difficulty reports -RRB- so I'd have to say they are fairly minor,'' said <PERSON> Orien </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, the company's vice president and co-founder `` We have the same stringent monitoring program as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, American and all the major airlines.'' Independent Air is 15 years old and flies 400-500 charters per year, mostly in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Flight attendant <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> often worked together and boarded a chartered jet with plans of building a life together. Wednesday, they died together. Ms. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, were planning to be married May 20, according to Ms. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> But their <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 crashed into a mountain in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing all 144 aboard. Both worked for <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The charter plane, bearing 137 Italian tourists and an American crew of seven, was flying from <LOCATION> Bergamo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, and would have continued without passengers to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said his daughter was undaunted about flying despite recent crashes and maintenance problems in the airline industry. `` She loved flying, it was a big thing for her,'' he said. `` Because she was going to be married, she did n't think they'd let her continue flying. `` She probably would have been out of this thing in a month or so.'' The couple had planned to live in <LOCATION> Acworth </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> had bought a house there, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. `` He also bought her a horse two weeks ago. He was so kind to her,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. `` She was a very nice, sweet girl,'' said the pilot's mother, <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. `` We were close.''

He owned his own plane, and flew helicopters in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> National Guard. `` He called me Sunday from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and asked me to tell the Guard he could n't fly because of his job,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and had worked as a waitress and a cellular phone saleswoman before becoming a flight attendant, her father said. `` She was a beautiful little girl,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Autopsy Shows Black Man Died From Drug Use, Not Police Brutality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A black man who died in police custody was the victim of drug use and not police brutality, as some activists have claimed, officials said. Despite the autopsy finding, about 55 demonstrators marched outside Town Hall for an ninth straight night Wednesday to protest what they alleged to be brutality against 22-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Tony'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's the same answers that they had before,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s uncle and leader of the nightly marches. `` They've diverted the traffic, that was n't the issue. We have to go further.'' The `` death, in my opinion, was caused by cardiac arrhythmia, brought on by cocaine use,'' <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` As far as police brutality is concerned, I could n't find any evidence of police brutality. ... `` I am calling this a homicide on the grounds that whoever supplied the drugs is responsible for his death,'' he said. County Prosecutor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> said his office and local police will investigate the case as a homicide. `` In terms of police brutality ... that case has ended,'' <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> said. ` We now have a homicide investigation under way. `` Unequivocally, the <ORGANIZATION> Morristown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or any individual member is not a suspect,'' he said. `` I would like to see the community as vigorous in attempting to identify the source of the drugs that killed <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as they've been in protesting.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Manahan </PERSON>, mayor of this affluent township about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, welcomed the findings. But the mayor, who has asked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mediators to look at the case, criticized <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> for not talking with leaders in the black community before releasing the medical examiner's report at a news conference. `` The main problem here has been one of trust and mistrust, and I think an opportunity was lost in the press conference,'' he said. Cardiac arrhythmia, as described by <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, occurs when a person's heart quivers and can not pump sufficient quantities of blood. The person faints and loses consciousness because blood can not reach the brain. Traces of cocaine, heroin, quinine and codeine were found in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s blood and urine. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the drugs were taken in the hour before death. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had puncture marks on both arms but <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he did not know if they were from medical efforts to revive <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or from the victim's own drug injections. The autopsy also showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had a laceration above the right eyebrow and a bruise on the scalp, but <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said they caused no damage to the skull or brain and did not contribute to his death. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also had a history of bronchial asthma but that did not play any rose in his death, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> died Jan. 28 after he ran away from police who tried to arrest him on a traffic warrant. Police caught him after he bumped into an officer in the low-income housing project where he lived. Afterward, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained of shortness of breath, police said. Witnesses said he cried out for help and collapsed soon after. Police took him to <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was pronounced dead.

 It is highly unlikely <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> will ever be freed, the chairman of the state parole board said after the panel refused to release the notorious mass murderer for a seventh time. `` He's still at war with society and definitely a danger ... but anything is possible,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leddy </PERSON>, chairman of the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terms </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters after announcing Wednesday that <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> will remain at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> at least three more years. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, leader of a cult-like `` family'' that in 1969 went on a grisly month-long murder spree, killing actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and eight other people, was denied parole by a unanimous vote. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> declined to attend the hearing after complaining about being held in handcuffs and a waist chain that was too long. The panel offered to let him come in without chains, pending approval by the warden, but he declined, said spokesman <PERSON> Vernell </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON>. `` He is vicious and he is terrible,'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, a deputy district attorney from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, told the panel. `` He certainly is one of the most vicious killers we have ever had in the history of our country.'' <PERSON> Leddy </PERSON> said parole for <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> was rejected because of the nature of the slayings, many of which involved torture and mutilation; an extensive criminal history dating to childhood; an unfavorable psychiatric report; disciplinary problems in prison; and no indication his behavior would change if he were released. Outside the prison walls, three men and a woman dressed in black demonstrated in favor of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>'s bid for parole, waving signs, one of which read, `` Find A New Boogieman, Give Charlie A Break.'' `` It's sort of a human rights thing,'' explained demostrator <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Everybody in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be allowed a fair hearing and he did n't get one.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> told the board he doubted <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> was seriously interested in being paroled. On previous occasions, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> indicated he would like to be paroled to <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> with spiders and snakes, or else be sent to outer space. At his last parole hearing three years ago, <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> said he was a `` force of darkness'' and had been spending his time fashioning scorpion dolls to unleash `` torment'' into the world outside. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> also told the board that since the conviction of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> and many of his followers, the state has received 352,000 letters and petitions from people opposed to their paroles. <PERSON> Leddy </PERSON> said it is `` highly unlikely'' the murderer ever will be freed. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> was convicted of masterminding the 1969 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> slayings of Miss Tate, coffee heiress <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Folger </PERSON>, hairdresser <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebring </PERSON>, Polish filmmaker <PERSON> Voityk </PERSON> <PERSON> Frykowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Parent </PERSON>, musician <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinman </PERSON>, stuntman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> `` Shorty'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBianca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, saved from the gas chamber by a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision overturning <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s death penalty law, is serving a life prison term.

 In a courtyard where only enormous wooden and rusting beams keep the walls from collapsing, the money-changers ply their trade. In this sensitive and openly tolerated black market, the value of currency can change with a small gesture of the hand or inflection of the voice. Today there is no sign of panic. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar is changing hands for 210 afghanis, compared to 238 a week ago when Soviet soldiers were still seen in full force. Now the Soviets are all but gone, and the money-changers say there's a feeling their departure will lead to peace and that the perenially warring Afghans will settle down to their traditional way of handling things _ by making a deal. Whether that's a realistic attitude remains to be seen, but the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s departure is having a buoyant effect. `` We did n't need them here,'' said one money-changer, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahir </PERSON>. `` We have problems, but we can solve them ourselves, God willing. I think it will be OK.'' One by one, Soviet bases around this city of 2 million people have been handed over to Afghan government forces Several hundred Soviet soldiers are still hanging on to guard the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, but they are to leave by next week. The rest of the thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops who were around the capital three weeks ago are home or on their way, either in convoys heading up the snowy <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> to the Soviet border or on huge military transport planes. Moslem guerrillas have launched few rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and the government shelling of guerrilla hideouts in the mountains has tapered off. On the surface at least, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is calm. The markets bustle with women clad in traditional chadris, the all-enveloping veil that cascades in pleats from a skullcap, with a coarse mesh panel over the eyes. Children slide down the icy hills and fly kites in the street. Smoke-belching buses and horn-blaring taxis jam the narrow streets. Carts filled with fresh bananas and oranges from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and pomegranates and apples from other parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> mask for a few seconds the stench of impoverished humanity. On Chicken Street, the main venue for foreigners and the wealthy, merchants sell everything from centuries-old carpets and antique muskets to Swiss watches and German beer. `` Goods are still coming in. There is plenty of food and other goods. All you need is the money to pay,'' said a merchant who identified himself only as Tamoor. The Soviet armored personnel carriers that a few days ago stood at the end of Chicken Street are gone. In their place are Afghan soldiers, clutching a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle in one hand and prayer beads in the other. Few signs remain of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s nine-year military intervention except for the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Moskvich </ORGANIZATION> cars, fur hats, vodka and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> caviar _ which has nearly tripled in price since the final Soviet withdrawal started in early January. Afghans openly voice their hostility toward Soviets and look upon foreigners with suspicion. `` Where are you from?'' <PERSON> Qurban </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> asked a group of Westerners. `` <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' one of them answered. `` Forgive me,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said, motioning the group inside his carpet shop. `` I thought you were Russian.'' For the city's 350,000 poor people, things are not so comfortable. A Soviet airlift and attacks on guerrillas blocking the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> have eased shortages of flour, but lines persist at the shacks where bread is sold. The poorest people survive on diets of bread, rice and tea. Heating oil and fuel are even scarcer, making a bitter winter even harder. A liter of gasoline sells on the black market for 175 to 500 afghanis -LRB- $ 3.20 to $ 9.10 at the official exchange rate -RRB-, compared to 30 afghanis -LRB- 55 cents at the official rate -RRB- for the scarce and tightly rationed government supplies. `` I had to walk seven kilometers -LRB- four miles -RRB- to work today,'' said a government interpreter. `` It's best to live near the trolley lines. They run on electricity.''

 The new government of coup leader Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is investigating allegations of financial irregularities involving public funds controlled by deposed President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, ruler of this landlocked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country since 1954, was ousted from power Friday in a coup engineered by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. About 50 people died in the takeover, and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was sent in exile Sunday to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Charges of corruption under Stroesser were widespread. Opposition politicians, once persecuted and now allowed to speak freely, have called for the creation of a commission to recover funds misspent under the old regime. Attorney <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolon </PERSON> filed a suit Monday charging three former government ministers and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s long-time personal secretary, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, of using public funds and accepting bribes to obtain mansions, apartments and autos. <PERSON> Rolon </PERSON> sought an embargo on their local bank accounts. That action was followed Tuesday by Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, former minister of public works, who alleged that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> personally controlled at least two accounts funded by public money. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced it was going to `` control withdrawals'' from accounts `` of some government institutions.'' <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, had signature power over funds exceeding $ 4 million _ revenues from highway tolls and gasoline taxes. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said he did n't know what <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> used the money for, but that in general, the funds were not available for use by his ministry. A Paraguayan businessman with close contacts in the banking industry said government officials loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> wrote and hurriedly tried to cash checks written on government accounts immediately following his ouster. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, publisher of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> but hopes to reopen this month, said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> measure was `` good, intelligent.'' `` This was taxpayers' money being administered as though it were a personal checking account,'' Zuccolillo said, adding, `` There must be dozens more accounts like this linked to other government ministries in state-run companies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the reason for the measure, which could cause delays in the payment of some government checks, was `` to obtain better control and greater clarification of the destination, and correct application, of public funds.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, secretary to new Economy Minister <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, said the bank would review `` all checks written by government officials who no are longer government officials.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> is in charge of the bank. In a separate development, he told reporters <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s foreign debt amounts to $ 2 billion, and there do n't appear to be funds to keep making payments. The last payment was made in December, he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> needs funds and if we do not find them, we'll have to talk with our creditors,'' he said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> declined to blame <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. `` He was a great president for many years,'' said <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>, who under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, during the last two years, he was surrounded by a group of totally irresponsible, greedy politicians totally lacking in patriotism.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time in more than 40 years, an independent daily newspaper has begun publishing in this Soviet bloc nation, the latest sign of an increasing tolerance for openness in Hungarian media. The first issue of Mai Nap -LRB- Today -RRB- contained an article that said the 1956 uprising should be commemorated with `` a national and historic holiday.'' Publication of the article plunged the 24-page tabloid, which is competing with <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s official <PERSON> Esti </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirlap </PERSON>, into a controversy over the revolt that was crushed by Soviet tanks. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a leading reformer in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo, last month called it a popular uprising. Party leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and several senior officials opposed to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s fast-moving reform movement rebuked <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, insisting on maintaining the official line that the rising was a counterrevolution to destroy communism. On Monday, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried statements by official and independent groups backing the widely popular <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>. The policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is to discuss the issue on Friday at a session that could result in major leadership changes. Last weekend, the daughter of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the premier who led the revolt, and widows of two <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> colleagues who were executed with him for roles in the uprising called for a public reburial of the three. It was in this atmosphere that <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> began serializing the hitherto unpublished memoirs of the late <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vas </PERSON>, a senior party official. In the memoirs, <PERSON> Vas </PERSON> stands up for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s aim `` to set up a typically Hungarian economic and political new socialist state system _ and a new page in the history of Hungarian socialism.'' The memoirs quote <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, the longtime party leader installed by the Soviets in 1956, as denouncing the `` counterrevolution'' as an `` armed uprising against state order and institutions.'' Vas, as quoted by <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON>, said in the memoirs, `` In my view, even if <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> then so saw Oct. 23, 1956 -LRB- the start of the uprising -RRB-, this day is a national and historic holiday of the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> people like March 15, 1848.'' That date marked the start of the Hungarian uprising against the <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION> monarchy. Like the 1956 revolt against communist rule, it was suppressed. According to <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON>, officials detained Vas in February 1973 on the grounds his memoirs contained anti-Soviet sedition. When <PERSON> Vas </PERSON> told investigators a copy had been deposited abroad, he was soon freed, the daily reported. The independent tabloid, which also featured many photographs and sports stories, costs 1.7 cents a copy, well above the price of <ORGANIZATION> Esti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>.

 Navajo Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, accused of taking kickbacks in tribe transactions, said his observance of Indian tradition in accepting `` gifts'' was minor compared to the excesses of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> politicians. In a 25-minute hookup with tribal radio station <ORGANIZATION> KTNN </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> lashed out at former first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in general and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, which is investigating allegations of bribery in his administration. `` I do n't need designer dresses loaned to me like <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Nobody is offering me $ 5,000 a night for speaking engagements,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> told radio listeners during a visit to <LOCATION> Crownpoint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, for a shopping center dedication. He declined to answer reporters' questions later. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was acquitted in 1977 of federal fraud and income-tax-evasion charges. According to testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, the 60-year-old chairman of the nation's largest tribe has profited from kickbacks in a variety of official Navajo transactions, including the $ 33.4 million purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> probe was racist and aimed at undermining tribal sovereignty. `` They are the gentlemen who are investigating my ethics of serving without one scrap of evidence that the favors I have received somehow mean I have sold out the tribe,'' he said. `` This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.'' `` Yes, I have accepted gifts, but that is not a crime,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> has been invited to testify but has not appeared before the committee, which began its inquiry last year after The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> published articles alleging waste and corruption on reservations and in federal Indian programs. The investigation threatened tribal sovereignty because the government was near to denying Navajos the right to enter into binding contracts, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. An estimated 170,000 of the nation's 200,000 Navajos live on the 25,000-square-mile reservation that covers much of northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and sprawls into northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bryon </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> real estate broker, has testified under a grant of immunity that he paid <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> $ 25,000 to amortize a bank loan, gave him $ 50,000 in cash and made a $ 50,000 BMW automobile available as his share of the $ 7.2 million profit realized by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s friend on the sale of the Big <LOCATION> Boquillas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had arranged for businessman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> to buy the ranch from <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 26.2 million. A few hours later, the tribe paid $ 33.4 million for the 491,000-acre spread in western <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The account was corroborated before the committee by <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, also testifying under immunity <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> told listeners too much emphasis had been placed on how the land was acquired, ignoring that the land could generate a profit. `` Because I supported and devoted the greatest land acquisition in the history of the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> people, I'm supposed to have sold out, to have betrayed my people. Well, let me tell you this: I did n't need any favors from <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

 A substance made from two natural proteins blocks AIDS virus infection in the test tube and may prod the body into fighting the virus, scientists reported today. One protein, called CD4, is already in human testing for its ability to block infection. But it may stay in the bloodstream longer if fused to the other protein, researchers said. In addition, this hybrid could bind to special sites on white blood cells in the test tube, suggesting that in people it may trigger an immune system attack on the virus and AIDS-infected blood cells, researchers said. Results of experiments with the hybrid, called CD4 immunoadhesin, appear in today's issue of the British journal Nature. The work was done by scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaconess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. CD4 is normally found on the surface of some blood cells. The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome binds to CD4 as an inital step in infecting those cells. Recent studies suggest that unattached CD4 can act as a decoy that uses up the specialized binding sites on the AIDS virus, leaving the virus unable to infect blood cells. But in their Nature report, researchers said animal studies suggest that CD4 may be eliminated quickly from the human bloodstream. Half of any given amount may be gone within a half hour to two hours, a measure called half-life, they said. Researchers fused the CD4 molecule to part of another human protein called an antibody. In rabbits, this hybrid stayed in the bloodstream up to nearly 200 times longer than CD4, the researchers said. In people, its half-life may be about three weeks, they said. The hybrid also blocked AIDS infection of blood cells in the test tube, researchers said. The research is `` a very logical approach'' for extending half-life, but that may also be achieved in other ways, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schooley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schooley </PERSON>, who is testing CD4 in humans, also cautioned that the usefulness of using CD4 alone or attached to other substances has not yet been determined.

<HEAD>Freshman Applications Down at Top Colleges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Freshman applications are down at top colleges around the country for the first time in years, the likely outcome of a dwindling number of high school graduates and ever-higher tuitions, admissions officers say. The decline in graduating high school students is considered the prime culprit, according to more than a dozen admissions officers interviewed since Feb. 1, the deadline for fall freshman applications at many of the nation's most competitive schools. `` Since this is happening to everyone, the best guess is that it's demographics,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Behnke </PERSON>, admissions director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, where applications are down 10 percent from a year ago. But some officials suspect that students and their families may finally be reacting to tuition increases that have consistently exceeded the nation's overall inflation rate throughout the 1980s. `` I think there's a great possibility that tuitions are a part of it,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, admissions director of <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where applications are off by 4 percent from last year. `` I do n't know of any topic that's being discussed more by boards of trustees.'' The number of high school seniors has dropped steadily from 3 million in 1980 to 2.76 million in 1988, and is expected to bottom out at 2.44 million by 1992. An unexpected increase in the ranks of older students and higher percentages of high school students attending college helped offset that decline in the number of 18-year-olds. Thus, to the surprise of many, college enrollments grew from 12.1 million to 12.5 million since 1980, and were up at 54 percent of the nation's colleges and universities, according to an annual survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. But college officials believe that the drop in applications for next fall's freshman class is the first sign that the long-expected decline in enrollment is about to arrive. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> estimates a 5-10 percent drop in applications, the first such decline in at least two decades. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and most other Ivy League schools are reporting similar declines. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s fall applications have dropped 6 percent, from 15,828 to 14,869, according to <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, assistant dean of undergraduate admissions. At <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, applications are also down, from 21,944 to 20,835 for next fall's entering class. `` I consider this a yellow light. We all kind of anticipated this,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Quin </PERSON>, admissions director of <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where applications are down about 5 percent. `` I do n't mean to imply that we're not concerned. This is a competitive business, and it's going to make it that much harder to increase the quality of our classes.'' Apart from the population changes, school officials say students may also be cutting down on the number of schools they apply to following a decade in which multiple applications increased sharply. An annual survey of entering freshmen by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> found that a record 37 percent applied to at least three colleges in fall 1988, compared with 26 percent in 1980. That increase has generally been attributed to students wanting to improve their odds of getting into a top school, and to shopping around for the best financial aid deals as tuitions have soared. But students are apparently starting to think twice about submitting a dozen or more applications now that application fees have hit $ 40, $ 50 and more. `` When you start talking about $ 50 fees, you get more selective,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, associate director of admissions at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study: Out-patient Alcohol Detoxification Effective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many alcoholics can be treated for their addiction just as effectively _ and much more cheaply _ at outpatient clinics rather than hospital treatment wards, a study today concludes. The report found that people suffering from mild to moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal stay off booze just as long when treated as outpatients. Those who went into the hospital were more likely to get through the initial program, but after six months those treated as outpatients were doing just as well. The study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Motoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashida </PERSON>, was conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. `` We conclude that out-patient medical detoxification is an effective, safe and low-cost treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal,'' the researchers wrote. The conclusions were based on 164 men who had volunteered for treatment of alcohol withdrawal. They were randomly assigned to the out-patient program or to hospital admission. Those treated as outpatients were given the drug oxazepam and asked to report to a hospital clinic each day, where their blood alcohol levels were measured and they were asked whether or not they had been drinking. The cost for the outpatients ranged from $ 175 to $ 388, while for those in the hospital it ranged from $ 3,319 to $ 3,665. Seventy-two percent of the outpatients and 95 percent of those admitted to the hospital successfully completed detoxification. However, after six months, there was no significant difference between the two treatment approaches. About half of the men in both groups said they had stayed sober. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said that several comparison studies are being conducted to look at alcohol treatment programs. `` The results indicate that the majority of patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms do not require hospitalization but can be treated safely and effectively as outpatients, with considerable cost savings,'' he wrote.

<TEXT>
 After nearly a decade of political asylum in the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, two former high-ranking officers in the army of the ousted <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> regime were permitted to leave and flew to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> City Wednesday night aboard a commercial flight from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. They were greeted by a Venezuelan diplomat and taken to a nearby hotel. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the pair would remain in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> a few days and that they planned to seek political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The two fled to the Venezuelan Embassy in July 1979, the same month the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> took power after a popular uprising ousted President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 62, and <LOCATION> Guerra </LOCATION>, 42, were members of the now-disbanded <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, as the army was known under <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. Known as `` The Ranger'' because of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military training, <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> was one of <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s trusted officers. He had suffered two heart attacks in confinement, and said in a 1986 interview that the only way out was if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` comes in and wipes these Communists out. `` Either that, or we will end up dying here,'' he had said. <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> kept himself busy by studying radio and television repair, and completed a correspondence course in electronics in 1986. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday quoted unidentified sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> gave the two a one-year `` exit permit'' instead of the customary safe-conduct pass. Repeated telephone calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the Venezuelan Embassy in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> went unanswered. Reporters were kept away from several Venezuelan diplomats gathered at <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON> International Airport before the pair left. Allowing the officers to leave was seen as a gesture of goodwill toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the Sandinista government, which is trying to cope with a rapidly deteriorating economy. Inflation reached 20,000 percent in 1988. The government has blamed economic problems on eight years of war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels; Hurricane Joan, which struck the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast last October; and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo since 1985. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is scheduled to attend a summit of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents next week in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The meeting, postponed many times, was called under a regional peace plan signed by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in August 1987.

<HEAD>Shiite Moslem Amal Appear In Control Of South Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fresh from victory over their rivals in the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the militiamen of the Shiite Moslem Amal appear to control south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The country's south is divided into strips: First, there is the Israeli-controlled security zone along the border, then an area patrolled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, then the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> zone running up to <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of the Israeli border. Leaders of Amal say their control over south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> means they can also control attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the security zone <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> proclaimed near its border in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But they would not strike at targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` No one is allowed to hold weapons or wear military clothes in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> except Amal,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreiss </PERSON>, the local <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> political chief. `` Amal is responsible for the security of everyone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers, numbering 5,800, have been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since a 1978 Israeli invasion. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up its security zone in 1985. <PERSON> Kreiss </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s responsibility for security in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was laid out in agreements signed over the last three months with the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Before the agreements, hundreds were killed in fighting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for control of Palestinian refugee camps, and with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> for mastery of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Shiite southern suburbs. The agreement means <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> has rid itself of `` direction from outside, from other countries,'' <PERSON> Kreiss </PERSON> said, indirectly sneering at <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> dependence on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He claimed Syrian backing for <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> did not represent influence but `` relations.'' <PERSON> Kreiss </PERSON> said four longstanding Amal tenets were included in the agreement: All <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> must remain unified, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> must have charge of the south's security, no attacks may be carried out on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces, and no foreigners may be kidnapped. To underscore the last point, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> security chief <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkus </PERSON> had his men take Western journalists on a tour of Tyre, including ancient Roman ruins. Led by a jeep with wailing siren, a convoy of four cars pushed through snarled traffic. A small measure of Amal's control was that the siren persuaded drivers to give way. Militias most often fire automatic rifles in the air to clear traffic. Along the roads, Amal checkpoints monitored traffic and the militia's green symbol was plastered on walls, along with posters of the late Amal leader of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, who was killed in last September's <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighting. In Tyre, a city of 50,000 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border, people appear less grim than when <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s power was on the rise and one cafe advertised live music. The Tehran-backed hard-liners had banned music, ordered booze off store shelves, and papered walls with posters of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. A stop for coffee by the journalists, at an outdoor cafe, drew curious Lebanese unaccustomed to seeing foreigners in anarchic south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 A man accused of murdering 14 family members in a 1987 Christmastime rampage had a `` love-hate relationship'' with one of his daughters that might explain some of the killings, a prosecutor said. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 48, should be sentenced to death for strangling and shooting his relatives, prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said in his opening statements Wednesday. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said the prosecution would present a note written by <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> that authorities found in a bank safe deposit box. `` It will show you and indicate to you a motive as to why Mr. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> killed some of these people,'' specifically his oldest daughter, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON>; her husband and 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, 46, said <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>. `` It will describe a love-hate relationship with this daughter,'' <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> told the jury. Relatives say <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> fathered <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>. The defense attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, told the jury to forget past publicity about the case. `` I want to ask you to be the most careful and most courageous jury that ever sat in this county, perhaps in this state, in behalf of the defendant,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> described how investigators found the bodies of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife, seven children, two of their spouses and four grandchildren at the <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> house north of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION> They found five bodies in the house on Dec. 28, 1987, and the next day found seven bodies in a grave and the bodies of two babies in the trunks of cars. Authorities found the bodies after arresting <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> for a 40-minute shooting spree that left two dead and four wounded in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has been convicted and sentenced to death for the two <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> murders. He has asked to be executed as soon as possible, but an opponent of capital punishment has appealed the sentence. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said ballistics tests showed that a pistol <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> handed over to former <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> upon his arrest was the same one used to kill five relatives. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> told the jury there was no evidence to link <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> with the pistol before he handed it over and no evidence on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' whereabouts during the period when the deaths occurred `` He would have to be around those people to kill them,'' the attorney said. About 100 spectators crowded into the courtroom at the <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, where the trial was moved from <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> because of publicity about the case. A dozen relatives of the victims sat on two benches in the front of the courtroom. Several wept as <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> told the jury the names of those slain and how they died.

 <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>' n' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, the comic characters who made `` holy mack ` rel'' an American catch phrase but deeply offended many blacks, may be coming out of retirement for a Broadway A federal appeals panel has cleared the way for writer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> to produce a stage show based on the famous pair, who were featured on one of the most famous radio and television shows of its era. The duo's Broadway debut still could be stopped if <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which owns many of the rights to the characters, takes the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, senior vice-president of communications for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, said the network was reviewing that option. But <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, who wrote the script for `` Fresh Air Taxi,'' a musical stage show that takes its name from the company <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> ran, said he was going ahead. `` I've rewritten the script and now I'm looking for a producer,'' he said Wednesday, two days after the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned a lower court decision on trademark rights to the characters. The `` Amos' n' Andy'' show was introduced on radio in the 1920s, when the black characters were all played by whites. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Algonquin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, Kingfish, <PERSON> Sapphire </PERSON> and the show's other characters came to television on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1951 and were portrayed by blacks. CBS pulled the show off the air in 1964 in response to complaints by black viewers who were offended by the ethnic stereotyping of the characters. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, a former newspaper columnist who wrote the recent `` The Fox that Got Away'' and an upcoming biography on director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>, said he first thought of an `` Amos' n' Andy'' musical in 1981. He said he tried to contact CBS over use of the characters but was continually rebuffed or ignored. In a lawsuit filed in 1984, <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had abandoned its trademarks by no longer using the characters. In August 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, saying that although the network had not used the properties or revealed plans for their use, it wanted to hold the option. But the three-judge appeals panel noted that when the issue came to court, the `` Amos' n' Andy'' trademarks had n't been used for 21 years. The judges ruled that the trademarks can not be protected if use was discontinued for more than 20 years. `` A bare assertion of possible future use is not enough,'' the panel said. The judges did uphold the network's rights to all scripts produced after 1948, when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> purchased the rights from the show's originators But the ruling allows <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> or anyone else to use any characters connected with the show before 1948, as well as such phrases from the show as `` Holy Mack ` rel,'' `` Ai n't dat sumpin'' and `` Scuse me for protrudin

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> never told his homosexual lover that he had AIDS because the actor thought he had been cured of the fatal disease, an attorney for <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate said. `` I do n't think he believed he had the AIDS virus in his blood anymore,'' attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said during closing arguments Wednesday in an $ 11 million lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s former lover, against the actor's estate. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> rebutted claims by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had deliberately hid his illness from his lover, saying, `` You do n't tell someone you have something that you do n't believe you have.'' Christian, 35, an aspiring musician who lived with <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> in the last two years of his life, contends he is entitled to compensation for the `` enhanced fear'' he suffered when he found out that his lover had AIDS. But <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who had been undergoing treatment in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with an anti-AIDs drug, was told by a doctor there that he was `` free of AIDS'' shortly before a final bout with the disease that killed him. The attorney also argued that <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> lied when he said he had sex with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> about 160 times between 1983 and 1985. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said it would have been impossible for Christian not to have contracted the disease under those circumstances, and suggested the tryst between the two men ended long before <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> was diagnosed as having AIDS. He said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> has tested negative repeatedly in tests for exposure to the AIDS virus. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, told jurors that when <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> became lovers in 1983, `` This was a different world as far as AIDS was concerned'' and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> had no fears. `` If they had met today, there might be an argument that he should have known better,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said in his final argument to the jury. `` But they met in 1982. All the world knew was that homosexual men were dying in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. All there was was speculation about what this thing was that was killing gay men. There was talk of gay cancer.'' In 1983, when the men became lovers, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said, `` There was no reason to use a condom. There was no reason for <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> to believe he could get AIDS from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who played the leading man to such actresses as Doris Day, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in movies and TV, died on Oct. 5, 1985, a few months after his battle with AIDS became public. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> claims that he was n't told about <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s disease until the public announcement that the star was dying.

 Jurors began considering 29 charges including attempted murder, burglary and arson against a man accused in a series of sniper attacks. The jury asked Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cresto </PERSON> to explain which of approximately 75 exhibits, including a gun, bullet fragments and casings allegedly used in the snipings, related to each of the various charges against suspect <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>. Before retiring to a downtown hotel Wednesday evening, the jury also asked <PERSON> Cresto </PERSON> to repeat the definition of `` assault with intent to commit murder.'' <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>, 25, is charged with six counts of assault with intent to commit murder and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with nighttime sniper attacks in northern <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> between Dec. 8, 1986, and Jan. 8, 1987. He also is charged with seven counts of conspiracy to commit burglary, seven counts of burglary and three of first-degree arson in connection with a string of housebreaks and fires in the late spring of 1987. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted on the arson charges. In his closing argument, defense lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> said the prosecution had produced no evidence linking <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON> to the shootings.

 Famed conductor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> has asked for a reprieve from his contract with the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> because of failing health, officials said today. The 80-year-old conductor wrote <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> culture authorities that he is unable to keep up with the pace demanded by his contract and wants to rest at his home near <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` He needs to reduce his workload and has submitted the recommendations of three doctors to that effect,'' said <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Pufendorf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> secretary for cultural affairs. <PERSON> Pufendorf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s request was `` nothing dramatic'' because the Austrian conductor has been ill for years. But with the letter, <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> conceded for the first time that his ability to conduct has been affected by a stroke, failing vision, circulatory problems and at least five operations he has undergone in the last 12 years. <PERSON> Pufendorf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s obligations with the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION> had been reduced to 6 concerts per year from 12 as earlier was required. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> has conducted the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic since 1954 and holds the honorary title of lifetime director. He is also lifetime director of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and has regularly conducted the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lucerne </LOCATION> music festivals. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> underwent a nine-hour operation in 1976 and had surgery again in 1979. He has been visibly hindered since a 1983 operation on his spinal column and two later operations to remove tumors. He has required a supporting chair behind the conducting pulpit for more than a year and is reported by orchestra members to be so far-sighted that he can not read music anymore and conducts from memory. He also suffers from a hearing problem. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> asked in the letter to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> cultural affairs senator <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON> for a break from his concert duties, noting he continues to suffer circulatory problems as a result of the stroke and influenza contracted last year. `` <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s health is not what it used to be,'' <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON> said. `` His life is a heroic exertion against illness and pain,'' a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> music critic commented.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier and a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> businessman have been indicted for allegedly faking more than $ 38 billion in trades in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities in a massive tax fraud scheme. `` There were no real transactions. It was all pieces of paper going back and forth,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It was an entirely fictitious operation.'' <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said the case, which allegedly involved $ 511 million in illegal tax writeoffs, was at least as large as any previous case of its type. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, 43, of Rye, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manko </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Lighthouse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were charged with conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and numerous counts of making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> or aiding others to do so. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, the brother of prominent takeover strategist <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, issued a statement calling the charges `` unfounded, unfair and unjust.'' `` I am confident that I will be completely vindicated by the jury that will hear my case,'' he said. <PERSON> Manko </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Chepiga </PERSON>, said she had n't yet reviewed the indictment but `` based on what has come to our attention during this long investigation, we believe Mr. <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> will be entirely vindicated.'' The investors were unwitting participants in the scheme and are n't under investigation, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said, although `` they may have to undergo civil audits'' to determine whether they owe back taxes. The investors include billionaire <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, confirmed his client and <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, had invested in two Edelman-Manko partnerships He said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> audits of the partnerships `` have been going on for years'' and that a settlement with all the partners to cover back taxes was being implemented. Among other investors listed in the indictment was a <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. Prosecutors would not confirm if it was the late fashion designer, and calls to a spokesman for <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>'s company were not returned. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> was not implicated in the alleged scheme. Through a spokeswoman, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, he issued a statement: `` This is a distressing and difficult time for our family. I will do everything in my power to assist my brother because I do not believe he would engage in any unlawful activity.'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> were accused of creating more than $ 38 billion in `` pre-arranged, rigged and fraudulent'' transactions in government securities to generate losses for investors in numerous limited partnerships, which the investors could write off against their taxes. The scheme involved at least 15 partnerships between 1982 and 1986, the indictment charges. Both <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> was charged with 24 false statement counts and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> was charged with 25 similar counts, each of which carries up to three years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. The pair also was accused of creating false trading and financing confirmations, causing the distribution of fraudulent sales literature and misleading lawyers who prepared offering materials and signed tax opinion letters for some of the limited partnerships.

 Coal miners at <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest power plant suspended a three-day strike today and <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appealed to workers not to strike while he tries to negotiate Solidarity's reinstatement `` Give a chance to the round table,'' The chairman of the free trade union movement said in an interview on state radio just hours after the miners ended the stoppage that had threatened to shut down the Belchatow plant's generators. `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is appealing for a chance for the round table. We have been waiting for so many years, we can wait a few days more,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had dispatched an envoy to help settle the dispute. He joined a working group on trade union issues that began talks today as part of historic `` round table'' talks between the opposition and government that opened Monday and are expected to last up to six weeks. `` Belchatow is just another proof that we should reach agreement on the most important things as soon as possible, and restore the organization called Solidarity,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the radio interview. The decision to suspend the strike at <LOCATION> Belchatow </LOCATION> until Feb. 28 followed a visit to the mine 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by an envoy for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and management's agreement to provide most of the pay raise sought by strikers, state radio reported. The strike had reduced coal supplies at Belchatow to about two days' reserves. The strip mine at the complex fuels the plant's generators, which produce one-fifth of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s electricity State radio said management raised pay by $ 41 a month, compared to the $ 59 monthly raise sought by the 4,000 strikers. On average, workers at the plant earn $ 145 monthly. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> had on Wednesday had accused <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s envoy, <PERSON> Aloyzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrzyk </PERSON>, of encouraging the strike at a rally attended by thousands of workers rather than trying to ease it. `` I must express decisive anxiety for the sense of the round table talks and chances for agreement. Agreement is not possible under strike pressure,'' Urban said. Today's working group was co-chaired by <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a top Solidarity adviser, <PERSON> Romuald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosnowski </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the official trade union alliance OPZZ and <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwasniewski </PERSON>, minister of sports and tourism. Solidarity hopes the negotiations will culminate in the restoration of its legal status after a seven-year ban. The government seeks to persuade its leaders to join parliament as a minority party. The Polish economy, beset by a $ 39 billion foreign debt, is in ruins. There are chronic shortages of basic goods and supplies, inflation was at 60 percent last year, and the declining value of real wages has produced increased worker unrest, including 39 strikes last month. Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszcak </PERSON> first proposed the negotiations in August during the country's worst labor unrest since the authorities crushed Solidarity in a December 1981 military crackdown. The only independent labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc was outlawed the following year. The government has sought the promise of a two-year strike moratorium in return for reinstatement of Solidarity. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, while acknowledging that strikes do n't help the economy, insists that workers have the right to strike over poor pay and working conditions. He has repeatedly warned Communist authorities of the potential of further unrest if economic and politial reforms are not implemented quickly. State television said 4,000 of the 12,500 workers at the Belchatow plant were on strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> put the number at 8,000. Signs of labor tension appeared elsewhere in the country today. Workers at the coke department of the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill near <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> have been refusing since Feb. 1 to work overtime, Solidarity spokesmen reported. Last year, riot police broke up a strike at the plant, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest steel mill. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was planning to travel to <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> later today to talk with workers from <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Harvard MBA accused of bilking her employer of $ 44,000 in moving expenses hired a thug to break her lawyer's leg with a baseball bat because she did n't like his handling of the case, prosecutors charged. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent Wednesday to assault and conspiracy charges in the attack. She was jailed on $ 100,000 bail. Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is accused of paying $ 500 to a hit man to attack her lawyer, O.T. Wells in 1987. The assault on the street put <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> in the hospital for four days with a broken shin and caused a mistrial in the larceny case. A second mistrial was declared Tuesday when her new lawyer, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, learned of the attack and withdrew from the case. Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate, was charged with grand larceny and forgery for billing <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 44,000 in moving expenses that had already been paid by her previous employer, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. On the eve of jury selection in the case, she complained about the quality of <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' legal representation, but the judge proceeded with the trial. Prosecutors had nearly rested their case when the bat attack occurred. Authorities refused to say whether the attacker had been caught or whether he had become a witness against Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. If convicted in the larceny case, she could receive up to 2 1 @ 3 to seven years in prison. The assault and conspiracy charges carry a maximum of five to 15 years. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, 57, said Wednesday he was shocked to hear of Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s indictment `` As a defense lawyer,'' he said, `` I'm outraged.''

 Thursday's Child, a sloop on pace to smash the 135-year <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> sailing record, did not have far to go as it entered waters off <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today. The modern three-man, 60-foot racing yacht was seeking to beat the record of 89 days and eight hours for the 14,500-mile journey around treacherous <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> at the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Set in 1854 by the legendary three-masted clipper ship Flying Cloud, it is the oldest existing speed record. Thursday's Child was expected to reach the latitude of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> early today and was on target to enter <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Golden Gate on Friday `` or Saturday morning at the latest,'' spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lush </PERSON> said Wednesday after a radio conference with the crew. The vessel left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Nov. 23 and must reach <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> by 2 a.m. PST on Feb. 21 to break the record. A Friday arrival would do that by 10 days. The race is against what was called `` the liveliest creation of man,'' a clipper ship praised in its day as a thing `` of satisfying beauty ... absolutely fitted for the purpose it is designed to fill.'' The 225-foot Flying Cloud required 100 men to hoist 35 sails up its masts. Thursday's Child is 165 feet shorter and has only two sails, but it boasts the latest in push-button satellite navigation equipment. <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelton </PERSON>, 32, a professional sailor, is its skipper. Owner-master <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 54, who helped design the boat, also are aboard. <PERSON> Lush </PERSON> said all were in good health with adequate water and food supplies. Even a five-day interruption at the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to repair damage from a below-waterline collision with an unknown object failed to knock the vessel off record pace. The boat was enjoying unusual southeasterly winds of up to nearly 30 mph, according to weather forecaster <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alden </PERSON>. She estimated the favorable winds would persist at least another day. The prevailing wind along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is from the northwest, which slows northbound sailboats. The Flying Cloud was one of the class of clipper ships whose development was spurred by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and Australian gold rushes and the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tea trade. Their nickname is believed to derive from the phrase `` going at a clip.'' Five other sailboats have been sunk since 1982 while trying to navigate the chaotic waters and stiff winds at the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 It did n't look like happy trails for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, but `` Lonesome Dove'' has ridden to the rescue. The success of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' four-night Western has not only boosted morale at the third-place network, but sent audience shares of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> soaring into the 80s in a season that has been averaging percentages in the 60s. On his CBS talk show Tuesday, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> told his audience they might find it a little warmer than previously. `` With the success of ` Lonesome Dove,''' he said, `` CBS has turned the heat back on in the studio.'' `` Lonesome Dove'' has more than met CBS' guarantee to advertisers. Televisions in an estimated 25.7 million homes were tuned to CBS for the series' first installment. Instead of the less-than-30 share the network expected, the miniseries is headed for an average share closer to 40. The share is a percentage of televisions in use. `` It's performing significantly better than we anticipated, though obviously we had great hopes for it because of the quality,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for marketing. `` The recent patterns of television viewing would create a healthy skepticism in terms of response, and we're very pleased.'' The audience reception shows that networks can still put on good programs and people will watch. `` Lonesome Dove,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shales </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> enthused, `` is enough to give one new respect for the miniseries, new respect for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, new respect for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, and even new respect for television. There is almost never anything this good on network TV.'' `` It is the best Western ever on the small screen,'' wrote <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- Star-Telegram. `` It is the best miniseries we have seen in 10 years. And it is the best overall show of the last few seasons.'' The four-part series that concluded Wednesday night is based on <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s 1985, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. The tale of life, death and love on a Texas-to-Montana cattle drive had an all-star cast, including Oscar winners <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> -LRB- `` Tender Mercies'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> -LRB- `` Prizzi's Honor'' -RRB-; Emmy winner <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -LRB- `` Executioner's Song'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Urich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, D.B. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Glenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headly </ORGANIZATION>. `` What it tells you is basically that quality will bring out audiences,'' said <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>. `` Now on the other hand, you do n't run out and make 10 miniseries based on this, because you have to realize you're dealing with Pulitzer Prize-winning book, an extraordinary production, extraordinary acting. `` I think the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> performance will go down in history as one of the great television performances of all time. When you have that kind of combination you're going to be successful.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research, said: `` I would say it's a little dangerous to draw any conclusions about the future of either Westerns on television or the future of the long miniseries on television, based on one case. ... I think if there's nothing else you learn in television it's that there's always the exception to the rule. Last season, the networks began fretting about the loss of viewers to cable options and videocassettes. The slide stopped, at least for this week. Sunday night's premiere of `` Lonesome Dove'' had a 28.5 rating and a 42 share and was the highest-rated show of the week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose weekly ratings compilations run Mondays through Sundays. Each rating point represents 904,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes with televisions. Monday and Tuesday's installments drew a 37 share each. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> might be losing the time period to `` Lonesome Dove,'' but the competition is not doing badly, and a hit for one is ultimately good for all three networks. `` It's always been my contention, as far as the network business is concerned, three healthy networks are really preferable. I would just like to be the healthiest of the three, but it's really to no one's advantage to have one or two networks not performing well,'' said <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>. Poor programming on any network chases viewers to cable and video alternatives, he said. But there's also a sense of tipping the hat when a competitor comes up with something really special. `` Lonesome Dove,'' <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON> said, `` is an excellent, very, very well-done show, and I think it deserves to get viewers.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> magazine has published a daring attack on the Soviet Communist Party, including unusually pointed criticism of the way President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is running the country. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, the author of the essay in the January edition of <LOCATION> Neva </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have failed to solve the Soviet economic crisis. The article is one of the harshest and most detailed attacks yet on the Communist system, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and `` perestroika,'' his reform program. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said in the literary and political magazine that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms are seriously hampered by what he called a `` new class.'' `` All decisions of the upper powers are carried out only to the extent that they are advantageous to the new class,'' <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said in the 28-page essay. He said the new class is a `` production and managerial apparatus'' that includes 14 million party bureaucrats, government ministers and managers. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>'s use of the term `` new class'' appeared to be a reference to <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON>' book `` The New Class,'' which criticized the Communist system. The Yugoslav politican and writer, who broke with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s leadership, said in the 1957 book that the Communist system had produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless society <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself has launched a war on bureaucrats who interfere in day-to-day decisions about production, and he has tried to transfer some of their power to local officials and factory managers. But <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has n't gone far enough and that the government and party have become subservient to the new class. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, 34, is a biologist and plant director who said he represents a new political club called `` Alternative.'' His article mocks the party's claim of popular support and uses the colloquial `` gensec'' as an abbreviation for general secretary, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s post in the party The new class, he wrote, is largely responsible for the lack of major improvements in the Soviet economy and for impediments to democracy that have arisen since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985 and the next month launched his perestroika program. `` We must admit the economy is in a crisis. ... For the years since the memorable April plenum of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the economy did n't get on track. ... The crisis, in this way, is deepening,'' he said. Perestroika is moving slowly not because of some mysterious forces, but because of `` well-organized sabotage,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has acknowledged that perestroika is not moving as quickly as he had hoped, but he has reaffirmed his commitment to reform and said the people support his reforms. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, however, said the current leadership is partly to blame for the country's economic woes. `` The good promises made from high rostrums hang in the air and are far from fostering the strengthening of faith in the possibility of perestroika,'' he said. The article also criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms under which a new more powerful legislature and presidency are to be created this year. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary and president _ or head of the legislature _ should not be held by the same man, as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposes, because the lawmakers are supposed to check his work. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness on some issues, has not yet been expanded to include criticism of the country's leader. The general secretary, he said, is still viewed as `` an inaccessible and exemplary figure'' and that feedback from the people he governs is essential.

 Environmentalists trying to protect the northern spotted owl cheered a federal judge's decision halting logging on five timber tracts. `` This is a temporary reprieve only, but a significant first step toward saving these ancient forest treasures,'' said <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday that halts logging on five <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> sites in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The judge cited the potential for irreparable harm to the environment and scheduled another hearing on the matter for Feb. 17.

 Jewish settlers stoned Palestinian cars in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and reportedly fired guns in the air after an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> settler burned to death. Authorities had said he died in a firebomb attack, but today they expressed doubts. Palestinians closed shops and businesses on the second day of a general strike marking the beginning of the 15th month of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. The strike came after a day of widespread violence that claimed the lives of up to six Palestinians, including two in a prison riot. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports today said <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuhdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeb </PERSON>, 17, became the second inmate to die as a result of wounds sustained when troops opened fire to quell the riot at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION> prison in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Another prisoner died Wednesday. Also Wednesday, settler <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerassi </PERSON>, 38, died when his car went up in flames near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Alfei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Menashe </LOCATION>, 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. News of his death caused angry reactions Jewish settlers. Settlers from nearby Ariel flocked to the main road and stoned Arab-owned cars, distinguishable by blue license plates. Others hurled rocks at houses and fired guns in the air. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said several cars were damaged and a Palestinian couple was injured when their vehicle was forced off the road into a ditch. `` If there is no change, they -LRB- Arabs -RRB- must understand that there may be a Jewish uprising as well,'' said <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Indor </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Jewish settler's council. `` We can also throw firebombs into civilian cars.'' But the army and police said today investigators found no glass fragments or other evidence of a firebomb. `` We were looking for remains -LRB- of a firebomb -RRB-, and we did n't find any, and there are doubts,'' said an army official. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the incident raised suspicions Palestinians were using a new method of attack. Other newspapers said the fire may have been started by a short circuit. At <PERSON> Alfei </PERSON> <PERSON> Menashe </PERSON>, settlers held a stormy meeting Wednesday night with the army's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>. `` You simply have to resign,'' shouted one settler amid loud cheers. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, along with about 850,000 Palestinians. Fifteen Israelis have died in previous violence during the Palestinian uprising which began on Dec. 8, 1987. The Palestinian death toll is 379. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> chastized settlers for their actions. `` This encourages them -LRB- Palestinians -RRB- to continue and increase their attacks because they see their enemies getting angry and appearing to lose their equilibrium,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, hospital officials said 8-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Talal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisharat </PERSON> died today of head injuries suffered last weekend in an explosion. Relatives said he and another youth were injured when an explosive object was hurled at them from a military jeep in <LOCATION> Froush </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dejan </LOCATION>. His 13-year-old cousin, <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisharat </PERSON>, was injured in the incident. The army said the youth apparently played with something that exploded. A spokeswoman rejected the claim the object was thrown from an army jeep. `` No <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were in the area. It is has nothing to do with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers,'' she said. Hospital officials said five Palestinians died Wednesday, three shot in clashes with the army in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, one in a prison riot in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and another as the result of wounds received earlier this week in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The army confirmed four died.

 A man has been convicted of murdering and robbing a pregnant woman who gave birth to a brain-damaged girl by Caesarean section moments before dying. A jury deliberated less than four hours before convicting <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> McCovey </PERSON>, 44, of second-degree murder and aggravated robbery for shooting <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> in front of her three children last April. Mrs. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 31, who was eight months pregnant, had gone to a video store with her three children to select videos for a pajama party. She died moments after doctors delivered her daughter by Caesarean section about an hour after the shooting. The child suffered brain damage because of her mother's injuries, a fact that was kept from the jury by 3rd District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCovey </PERSON>, who admitted using alcohol and amphetamines at the time of the crime but said he did n't intend to kill Mrs. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, cried after the verdict. `` I thought the jury would believe his version of what happened because it was true,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said. `` I think <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> had more confidence than we did.'' Deputy Salt <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuyk </PERSON>, who had sought a first-degree mu, said, `` The jury has spoken and we accept their verdict.'' <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said he was relieved by the verdict and had been worried by publicity over the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> execution of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and a recent <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling upholding a death sentence against another of his client's, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. `` The last first-degree homicide trial I had, I lost, and my client is on death row. So this is a great relief,'' he said. In closing arguments, <PERSON> Vuyk </PERSON> said that <PERSON> McCovey </PERSON> intended to kill Mrs. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. `` He placed a gun _ a .38 - caliber pistol _ to the back of her head and pulled the trigger ... that bullet entered her skull because he pulled the trigger,'' <PERSON> Vuyk </PERSON> He also recounted that the victim's then 11-year-old daughMcCovey say `` that'll take care of her'' or `` that's the end of her'' after her mother was shot. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said <PERSON> McCovey </PERSON> had no reason to kill the woman and had insisted his gun discharged accidentally. `` He's living his own self-imposed sentence, ladies and gentleman.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leaders today called for the reconciliation of the warring factions of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in a peace plan they said would keep the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning to power. A Cambodian resistance official said he hoped the infamous <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, would have no part in a future <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government. Under the proposal, 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> personnel would supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, who have occupied <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since they invaded the Southeast Asian country in 1978. Troops from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peacekeeping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also would be stationed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the Vietnamese left to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from monopolizing power, prevent a civil war and protect <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from the possibility of another Vietnamese invasion. The leaders also called for establishment of a provisional government during the withdrawal that would include the three resistance factions and the Vietnamese-backed government. An army made up of 10,000 men from each Cambodian faction also would be formed. Any group with more than 10,000 men would be forced to demoblize them. General elections would follow. The plan was presented by <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, acting head of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and vice president of the resistance coalition; Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, son of resistance leader and former Cambodian king Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Soubert </PERSON>, son of guerrilla leader <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. They appeared at a packed news conference in <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, did not take part. `` We do not want a bad peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, we do not want to be another <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. `` Without national reconciliation, we have no hope in our country.'' <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> said the proposal differed from an earlier plan put forward by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in that it attempted to address Vietnamese concerns about a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> also rejected the earlier plan because it said the proposal would result in civil war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` Under the new plan, those obstacles have been removed,'' said <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>. `` Now let us see if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> really has the intention of pursuing a political settlement.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 and toppled the pro-Chinese <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who killed hundreds of thousands of people in a three-year reign. But faced with a worsening economy and pressure from its backer, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it will withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September, provided the four warring parties can arrive at a political settlement. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> says 50,000 troops remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. American officials put the number much higher. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also has given in to Soviet pressure to talk to the Vietnamese. Last month in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, in their first negotiations since 1979, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the major backer of the resistance coalition, would cut its aid to the guerrilla factions as Vietnamese forces returned home. Last week, the Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers discussed the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict for the second time in two months. They agreed that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal must be supervised by an international agency but failed to agree on the nature of the supervision or on the make-up of a coalition government during the Vietnamese withdrawal. They also set May 15-18 as the dates for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. <PERSON> Tosay </PERSON>'s proposal will be discussed during a second round of informal peace talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, beginning Feb. 19. The first round was held last summer. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> said today he opposed the return to power of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, whose measures to establish radical agrarian communism resulted in massive killings. `` If I had to vote for Mr. <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, it would of course be ` nyet,''' he said. `` But we feel the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people should be allowed to decide.'' He denied charges that the resistance coalition was delaying peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` How could we as victims be obstacles to peace?'' he asked.

 Republicans rallied today to defend Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, whose confirmation vote has been delayed while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigates allegations about his drinking and his financial ties with military contractors. `` For those who have known him for a very long time, it's very significant that they have never seen him incapacitated, never seen him drunk,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that is considering the nomination, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show `` And indeed neither have all the waiters who have been interviewed in response to all of the many flake allegations that have been thrown in over the transom,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He said he has reviewed `` as much of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files as are available to date and there is nothing in there that in any way shakes my complete confidence that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is the smart, tough secretary of defense that we need.'' Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said of the nomination on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that `` I do n't think it's in a bit of trouble I think that these rumors are going to be checked out, as they should be. They're going to be proved false and we'll confirm <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, hopefully in the next couple of weeks. `` The experience of people, including the chairman of that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- committee, have been that they have never seen <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> impaired because of drinking. ... They have never seen him drunk, they have never seen him unable to perform duty, never seen him fail to show up for an appointment,'' Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said on `` CBS This Morning. The committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said Wednesday following a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> that he still had `` serious concerns'' that would prevent him at this point from voting in favor of Tower's nomination `` Each of the charges that have been leveled against him and investigated subsequently have all proved groundless, baseless,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., appearing with <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> asked that the vote be put off until the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> completed its investigation <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said `` to suggest that there are a whole lot of just silly accusations ... simply is not the information that we're getting from the White House. ... Clearly they must believe that there is something in these reports or they would not have asked us to put off the vote.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met for two hours Wednesday afternoon with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to discuss the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations and then closeted themselves with Tower for 90 minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an unnamed administration source as saying Tower presented the lawmakers with statements from his doctors that he does not have a disabling alcohol problem. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meantime, stood by his nomination of the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator to head the Pentagon. `` If somebody has something other than rumor and frenzied speculation, please get it to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or get it to the White House staff, or certainly get it to the committee in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But let us be fair enough that we do not deal in rumor after rumor,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said `` there are still some matters yet to be received'' in an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> review of allegations that Tower is a heavy drinker and womanizer. A separate <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> review of `` new allegations of a financial nature ... will take another week or 10 days'' to complete, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding that it `` has to be completed before the committee can proceed to a vote.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> begins a week-long recess on Friday, meaning the committee could not vote before Feb. 21 to reject the nomination or send it to the full chamber. A Republican on the committee, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said the new allegations linked Tower to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing fraud investigation known as `` Ill Wind,'' which has centered on payments by defense contractors for classified information on lucrative military contracts. `` It has to do with this procurement scandal, the ` Ill Wind' thing,'' said <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the main new allegation `` relates to Senator Tower's activities while he was in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' but did not elaborate. Another administration official said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background inquiry focused on contributions to one of Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns by a contractor now under investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing fraud investigation. But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, emphasized that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Tower and said politicians ca n't control who gives money to their campaigns. During four days of testimony before the committee, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> denied any financial wrongdoing. But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and other senators have voiced concern whether Tower could avoid conflicts of interests after receiving more than $ 1 million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. The administration had been pushing for a vote this week, but dropped that after <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> met Tuesday night with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he `` told the president frankly that I have serious concerns, and I also stated that if a vote was held immediately as some have urged, I would vote no because of these concerns.'' The chairman said he had not polled the committee, but the second-ranking Democrat on the panel, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, said he agreed with <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, too, said he could not vote at this time to approve Tower.

 The slaying of an army captain led to a clash between government troops and Moslem radicals in which as many as 100 extremists were killed, civilian sources said today. The soldiers and the radicals, who were armed with spears and arrows, fought Monday in <LOCATION> Talangsari </LOCATION>, a southern <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> village, according to Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sunardi </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> regional military command. In the first report on the fighting, <PERSON> Sunardi </PERSON> said the battle occurred follwing an attempt by the military to free army Capt. Sutiman. The general said the extremists had taken the officer hostage and later killed him. However, civilian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the army captain was killed in a clash with the extremists earlier Monday. They said <PERSON> Sutiman </PERSON> and other army commanders were attacked by the rebels when they came to meet with the extremists, who held a rally Sunday. They said the military reinforcements attacked later Monday in retaliation. <PERSON> Sunardi </PERSON> said the radicals battled with spears and bows and arrows. The civilian sources said the battle involved about 300 members of the radical group in the village, including women and children. At least 27 radicals were killed, <PERSON> Sunardi </PERSON> said. The civilian sources put the death toll at more than 100 and said two of the dead were soldiers. The civilian sources said about 55 extremists also surrendered to soldiers, who razed four buildings used as the headquarters of the radical group, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Fisabillilah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the radicals fled into the jungle, <PERSON> Sunardi </PERSON> said. He said the military officer was seized by the radicals when he went to the area Sunday to investigate reports of an `` Islamic deviationist group.'' <PERSON> Sunardi </PERSON> said the movement uses Islam to mislead the people in an effort to destablize the government. In September 1984, 30 Moslem radicals were killed in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> in a clash with the military.

<TEXT>
 The family of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruit who panicked and drowned during rescue training has filed a $ 20 million claim against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The death in March of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, led to charges against instructors and reform of training practices at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> here. The claim accuses the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of negligence in allowing <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the class after he had been diagnosed as having a phobia about being held under water. It also charges the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of intentionally inflicting emotional distress on the family by first reporting that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death was an accident. The family, dissatisfied with the initial report, got help from congressmen in getting an investigation that led to charges. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s family, said the claim was sent Wednesday to the commander of the Naval Air Station in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has six months to respond. If it does not respond, the family can file a lawsuit, he said. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said the claim would be forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> legal services office on the base. He would not comment further. Witnesses said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, who had a phobia about being held under water, was dragged back in despite his pleas to quit the training. A pathologist concluded that he was literally scared to death, suffering heart failure and drowning. An instructor was convicted by court-martial of negligent homicide. Four other instructors received administrative punishments of fines or demotions. The officer in charge was acquitted of dereliction of duty. As a result of the case, instructors are no longer allowed to come into physical contact with students and must immediately cease drilling trainees who panic, ask to quit or show signs of excessive fatigue, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A company sold state agencies more than $ 300,000 worth of meat mixed with pet food, beef lungs, chicken necks and other illegal additives, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s attorney general charges in a lawsuit. `` When you read through this, it is frankly a modern-day horror story,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said of the suit seeking $ 800,000 in damages from <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The suit was filed Wednesday in state court. West Meat has had contracts with more than 25 state facilities, including hospitals, prisons, the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Blind. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said he had no reports of health problems related to the allegedly tainted meat. He said the state stopped using the meat in October and forced West Meat to pick up more than 60,000 pounds already shipped. `` Between February 1986 and October 1988, the state paid <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 300,000 for meat products we believe may well have been adulterated,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. The suit said the company added pet food, spoiled meat, beef blood, suet, beef lungs, chicken necks, kidneys, adrenal and salivary glands, and deer and chicken meat to ground beef, pork sausage and Polish sausage. `` The federal government does not allow any of these elements to be mixed with the meat products shipped to the state,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. `` And the state contract is specific in its requirement for ground beef to be 80 percent lean and 20 percent fat, with nothing added.'' A lawyer for the company, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilo </PERSON>, had no immediate comment today. The suit charges the company, its president, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> A. West, and a plant manager with fraud, violations of merchandising laws and breach of contract. `` We're not alleging health and safety problems, although I'm sure that's why the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has these standards,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the suit would not stop <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> from taking legal action against the company.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, preparing to take over as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, told party officials today they face `` tough adversaries'' and must work to define party positions more forcefully on issues such as defense, crime and drugs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who will become the first black to chair a major political party, told the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chairs </ORGANIZATION>, `` I am going to be a common-sense, pragmatic chairman.'' He told the state party leaders, `` We've got a difficult job ahead, we've got tough adversaries. ... They do n't care much about truth or about decency.'' Taking over amid concern about erosion of the party's Southern base, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want to be chairman of a party that writes off any region of the country.'' `` We have to be willing to define ourselves as a party,'' he said. `` You ca n't possibly win if you let your adversary, your opponent, define you.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that 30 and 40 years ago `` people could always say what we stood for and whom we stood with.'' Citing defense, crime and drugs as issues of primary concern to voters, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Democrats `` have got to be willing to speak forcefully on those issues.'' Ending his four-year term as party chairman, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> executive committee on Wednesday, `` we ca n't afford for a moment to write off the South'' and expect to win presidential elections `` We have had our clock cleaned in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in the past several presidential elections,'' he said. Pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told the group that in the 1988 election, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won all 155 electoral votes in the South against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` You ca n't start out any game behind 155-0 and be competitive,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, blaming the loss in large part on the Democrats' preference for programs over values <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he believed the South could be won by `` the right messenger with the right message.'' Those assessments of the party's failure to attract support in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> came as the Democrats gathered to elect <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s successor. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will be the first black to be chairman of a major political party. He easily defeated four rivals for the post and will be unopposed when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> votes on Friday. Despite the ease of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s victory in the chairmanship race, there were lingering questions about the impact his election will have on the party in the South. `` Will it help?'' asked Atlanta-based pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. `` The answer is no. What can <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> do to help the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>? Bring the liberal vote to it? It's already there. `` Bring the black vote to it? It's already there.'' <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said Republicans would use <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election to put out the message to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> whites that `` the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> now is the party of blacks.'' Still another analyst of Southern politics, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election could cause problems for Democrats in the region `` not so much because he's black, but that he's tied to the twin devils, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is a former aide to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and was a top adviser to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the closing stages of his 1988 campaign. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told the Democrats they also must learn to appeal to white Protestant voters and the middle class. `` We have to be able to talk to them,'' he said. He said white Protestants make up about 48 percent of the electorate and that the Democratic ticket lost their votes by a 2-1 margin. About 40 percent of the electorate are middle-class voters and they went Republican by a margin of 55-to-44, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. As for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, it was n't enough for the Democrats to hold their nominating convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and pick <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as the vice presidential nominee. The Republican ticket prevailed by running on values such as law-and-order and a strong defense, while the Democrats ran on programs, he said. `` We've got to be able to get from programs to values,'' he said. He also said the Democrats tend to `` ignore what we do n't do well'' and for that reason failed to make a strong case for national defense.

 Salvage workers today trudged across a muddy mountainside searching for bodies and clues to explain why a pilot steered his <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 straight into the peak, killing all 144 people aboard. At least 90 bodies have been recovered, along with one of the jet's two flight recorders, said <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Baptista </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Vila do <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> town council. `` There are no survivors,'' she said in a telephone interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. She said 40 to 50 bodies were found today and 50 were found Wednesday, shortly after the crash. The smell of oil hung in the damp air, and a light rain fell on debris that included playing cards, a book of fairy tales and vacation clothing, still neatly folded. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charter plane, carrying 137 Italian vacationers and a seven-member American crew, was preparing for a refueling stop on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> island when it slammed into 1,794-foot-high <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> mountain. It was headed to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Civil aviation officials said the 20-year-old jet had a history of minor service problems. Access to the wooded crash site was very difficult, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON>, chief of the Azorean resuce services. `` The ground is slippery, and it's foggy,'' he said. The Italian government sent a plane to the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> with medical personnel and firefighters to help salvage efforts, and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said today Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> issued a message of sympathy for relatives of victims. Witnesses said the plane hit a slope, bounced over a road, lost an engine and crashed into the mountain. Bodies were spread in an area with a 1.8-mile radius about 24 miles northeast of the airport. Construction worker <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Barro </PERSON> said he and the village priest, heard the crash and ran to the site. `` We tried to find someone alive to get them out,'' he said. `` But we only found dead bodies.'' Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> do <ORGANIZATION> Porto </ORGANIZATION> said the aircraft was making `` normal maneuvers'' preparing to approach the airport's main runway but should have been at 3,000 feet and was `` much too low.'' The jet's pilot had not reported any trouble in a radio conversation with the airport three minutes before the crash, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> LUSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Earlier unconfirmed reports said the pilot had requested a runway be cleared for an emergency landing. `` The plane was very low, everything seemed perfectly normal, then it turned and flew straight into the mountain,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vairos </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueredo </PERSON>, mayor of the fishing village of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> near the airport. `` There was a tremendous explosion. The plane burst into flames and trees around it caught fire. Nobody could possibly have survived,'' <PERSON> Vairos </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueredo </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> is the easternmost of the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> archipelago 750 miles west of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The crash site is about 8 -LCB- miles from <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION>, capital of the 40-square-mile island. The jet belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based company. It said the plane was flying from <LOCATION> Bergamo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. It was chartered by the Dominican firm Dominair by six Italian travel agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported fog in the area with a visibility of five miles below 500 feet and scattered clouds at 500 feet. The craft was one of two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707s the company owns, said A.L. <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. He said it had 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and fewer than 50,000 hours in the air. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said that was not excessive. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the plane began service in 1968. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records show seven service difficulty reports on the plane over the past six years, agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON> said. She said they dated from January 1983, when a report said the plane's No. 2 engine was shut down due to turbine failure. Several travelers quoted by Italian news media said they had flown on <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> 707s on previous trips to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and complained about problems with seats, tray tables and air conditioning in the jets. Italian state radio said the tourists aboard the flight paid `` bargain'' prices for the package tour vacation in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, `` maybe too cheap.''

 A court today declared <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an `` absconding offender'' in an effort to extradite him from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face charges in the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas leak. Chief Judicial Magistrate R.C. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> issued a warrant Nov. 15, 1988 for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s arrest to answer homicide charges filed by the Indian government. Repeated summons have failed to bring <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, Indian government counsel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> in requesting the former executive be declared an absconder. <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> granted the request, which is designed to make it easier for the Indian government to initiate extradition proceedings. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do not have an extradition treaty, but individual extraditions are possible. The proclamation issued by <PERSON> Mishra </PERSON> orders <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to appear before the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> magistrate at 11 a.m. on March 31. Charges of culpable homicide were filed in November against <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

The liquid turned into a lethal gas when it hit the air and wafted over nearby shantytowns in the middle of the night. More than 2,000 people died almost immediately, either in their sleep or as they tried to flee. More than four years later, gas victims are still dying, according to government reports. Officials say the overall death toll is more than 3,300. The government lists 20,000 people as gas-affected survivors, and more than 500,000 people have sought compensation for alleged exposure to the gas or psychological harm caused by the disaster. The Indian government is seeking $ 3 billion in damages from <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, but the suit has bogged down in a variety of Indian courts. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> soon after the gas leak and was arrested after stepping off the plane. He subsequently was released on bail of 25,000 rupees, worth about $ 2,085 at the time.

<HEAD>Affirmative Action Promise Releases State Money For Symphony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Legislators freed $ 1.25 million for the ailing <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> after it pledged to try to hire more black musicians. The 100-member orchestra has only one black musician, even though its home city is two-thirds black, and until recently has n't tried to recruit more, its chairman, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said at a legislative hearing Wednesday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he made no specific promise to hire a black musician but that he hoped the orchestra would hire one before the end of the year. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 2.5 million to help the financially struggling orchestra. The orchestra got half the money immediately, but lawmakers reserved the rest until they reviewed its efforts to hire minorities and solve its financial problems. On Wednesday, an appropriations subcommittee freed the rest of the money on a unanimous vote. `` I'm convinced major change has taken place and will continue to take place in the orchestra,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, who sharply criticized the orchestra's record on hiring blacks in a meeting last week. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said that the orchestra would be `` out of business'' without the money. `` One is we ca n't afford to lose this money. Secondly, if we were to be denied this money, the reason would be we did n't live up to affirmative action goals,'' he said. `` I could n't go to any corporation or individual and say, ` Please keep us in business, the state just cut off our water because we're racist.''' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said symphony executives were developing a five-year plan to take care of the money problems. But hiring more blacks could be more difficult because there are relatively few black classical musicians, the symphony has only about a half-dozen openings each year and it uses a blind audition in which musicians are screened from the judges when they play, he said. As many as 100 musicians apply for each opening in the symphony and only one to three are black, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Musicians earn about $ 50,000 a year. `` This is the big leagues and every kid on the sandlot wants to play in the major leagues and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is one of those,'' he said. `` In the music world, this is a high-paying, glamorous job.''

<TEXT>
 The government today banned a neo-Nazi organization, and police found a cache of weapons and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> propaganda, including <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> posters, during a sweep of the party's headquarters. The ban of National Rallying blocks it from fielding candidates in next month's municipal elections and comes amid a fear of a resurgence of right-wing extremism in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network showed police carrying knives, guns and a box filled with ammunition from the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> home of neo-Nazi <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, head of the party. His home serves as the party's headquarters. `` The police action had obviously caught the neo-Nazi leaders completely off guard,'' <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> said, noting that <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> was not home at the time of the morning raid. The broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house, where <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so they would cause more severe injuries. `` This blow against the neo-Nazis should be a renewed sign and an unmistakable warning signal,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said in a statement. He said the country `` is not about to become a roaming ground for right-wing extremists.'' The organization's goals have included expulsion of foreign workers and people seeking asylum in the country. It has about 170 members. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said police staged coordinated raids on apartments belonging to the National Rallying in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Westphalia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> states. Bavarian officials said in a statement their searches turned up an air rifle, two steel helmets, a gas mask, three pistols for firing blanks and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> propaganda. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said National Rallying was banned because `` it damages with its open profession of neo-Naziism the reputation of the Federal Republic.'' In a later statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the group espouses revolutionary aims to change West German society and thus `` attacks the free democratic constitutional structure.'' The group had registered candidates for elections in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Langen </LOCATION>, and members indicated they would also seek support in other communities in the March voting in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state. Its German initials `` NS'' are identical with the best-known German abbreviation for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been banned since <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was founded in 1949. Under West German law, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> may ban any organization which it determines is spreading Nazi propaganda. There have also been calls for the ministry to ban another neo-Nazi group known as the Free German Workers' Party, which the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says has about 500 members. The Free German Workers' Party is under investigation in connection with arson attacks against foreign workers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The interior minister accused <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> and his followers of building up neo-Nazi groups nationwide. <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> also has been active with right-wing extremists from several countries in planning celebrations for the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birth on April 20. Under the ban, National Rallying can not carry out any activities as a group, including fielding candidates for an election. The name National Rallying is also banned from use. Violations carry criminal penalties for individuals involved. The government in December 1983 outlawed <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists-National </ORGANIZATION> Activists group. He served a 3 -LCB- - year prison sentence for neo-Nazi activities and was released in March 1988 National Rallying was formed last summer. In addition to <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>'s group, the extreme right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also has shocked many West Germans with a strong showing in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections last month.

 A rare <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> snowstorm threatened crops, wreaked havoc on freeways, and stranded motorists. Millions of people were absolutely delighted. `` I think it's very cool,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION>, 35 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The trees outside all look like Christmas.'' The storm, the latest product of a relentless arctic cold front, blew snow and ice across <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday after smashing low-temperature records throughout northern and central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and around the nation. Rising temperatures and rain in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> turned Wednesday's winter wonderland into today's morning mush. Temperatures rose moderately in most parts of the nation, but the Alaskan front refused to die. Strong wind and cold weather poured into the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, leaving snow drifts 10 feet high in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Snow also fell early today in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Alaskan weather has been blamed for at least 92 deaths nationwide since moving into the lower 48 states on Jan. 31. Cold weather was blamed for the deaths of 26 people in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where temperatures have dipped into the teens. Citrus growers conducted an emergency harvest of oranges, grapefruit and tangerines but said it was too early to tell how much of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s citrus crop had been damaged Residents of the once-snowy <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tarzana </LOCATION> and the nearby city of <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> woke up to rain. The <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 60 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was the only southland area reporting a second day of snowfall today. It got 3 to 4 inches. The cold sent natural gas use to record levels and killed citrus and floral crops, threatening to raise the cost of an orange or a Valentine's Day bouquet. Near-freezing temperatures early today forced street people into shelters, and the cold apparently claimed a transient's life in <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION>, 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. An accident on an icy road killed one person in <LOCATION> Redlands </LOCATION>, about 65 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Blowing snow shut Interstate 5, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s main north-south highway, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Hundreds of truckers were stranded there and at other road closures, the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. Northbound lanes remained closed this morning. The <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>, which runs northeast from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, was also closed for much of the day. Today cars were escorted through the snow. Snowfall Wednesday measured up to half a foot in suburban <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, Thousand Oaks and <LOCATION> Tarzana </LOCATION>, closing schools and freeing students to frolic with makeshift sleds and snowmen. Many schools reopened today. In <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of downtown, children used trash can lids and cardboard boxes as sleds. `` It was all black and ugly and horrible,'' said young <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. `` Now it is all white and glistening and beautiful.'' Winter-weary tourists who had flocked to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for fun in the sun were thoroughly disheartened as temperatures hovered at 45 degrees and errant snowflakes melted into hot tubs and swimming pools. `` I was hoping to play a little tennis, but the weather's disappointing,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Videon </PERSON>, a 50-year-old businessman from <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, smart money was betting more snow would fall today, after the gambler's mecca was dusted with a light snowfall Wednesday. The city got a dusting of snow overnight. The Department of Energy postponed an underground nuclear test scheduled Wednesday at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. Monitoring aircraft would n't have been able to track any accidental release of radiation while it was snowing, said <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. In central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, snow was reported in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Asparagus growers in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> valleys reported frost damage. Small farmers who grow leaf lettuce also were hurt, but <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> growers generally were spared, said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` They did n't get real cold temperatures in citrus areas overnight,'' <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said. `` We've had damage but you could n't call it disastrous.'' Still, many growers and packers said lemon groves were hard hit by the cold wave, with some early estimates saying up to 35 percent of the crop may have been damaged. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the nation's top producer of lemons, a crop valued at $ 152 million in 1987. It will take about a week to 10 days for an accurate assessment of the frost's damage. Wholesale prices of oranges already have risen slightly in reaction to the cold. And flower growers in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said their crop was badly hurt. `` The damage is done. The freeze has damaged the crops out there and I do n't expect them to recover at all,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginilo </PERSON>, agriculture commissioner in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The county's 1987 floral crop was valued at $ 165 million and serves wholesalers on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. While some major suppliers of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> flowers predicted a shortage, it was unclear whether it would affect the market by Valentine's Day. The <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said prices may be `` slightly higher.''

<HEAD>Two Rights Activists On Hunger Strike, Likely To Face Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two leading Bulgarian dissidents are in ill health following 29 days of a hunger strike, sources said today. The Bulgarian and Western sources identified the two as <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON>, 47, who lives in <LOCATION> Plovdiv </LOCATION>, 60 miles southeast of the Bulgarian capital <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Minev </PERSON>, 71, from the town of <LOCATION> Septemvri </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Plovdiv </LOCATION>. They are leading members of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. The sources, who spoke by telephone to The Associated Press and refused to be identified further, said both men are likely to face trial on various charges in an attempt by authorities to disrupt the association. Newspaper articles in the state-run Bulgarian press this week hinted that authorities are preparing to put <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON>, secretary of the association, and Minev, its chairman, on trial. In a lengthy article Feb. 7, the Bulgarian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Workers' Daily commented: `` Is there a state committed to the rule of law that will not call to account the conspirators who make it their objective to overthrow the lawfully established government and to undermine the foundations of the social order?'' On Jan. 11, authorities raided <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON>'s home and seized some written material, including association documents, Bulgarian emigres in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said. Workers' Daily published what it said was the program of the association. The program, as reported by the newspaper, calls on members to `` organize a massive movement, which in just a few months' time will already be in a position to assume the reins of government.'' The newspaper suggested that if <PERSON> Minev </PERSON> is tried, he will be charged under an article of the constitution prohibiting organizations that `` propagate a fascist or other anti-democratic ideology'' and are `` directed against the socialist system of ... <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and the rights of citizens.'' <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON> would face charges of publishing pornography in a poem he wrote, the newspaper indicated. The text of the poem was not given. According to one source, <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON> was visited by two doctors this week who described his condition as serious. The report could not be independently confirmed. The condition of Minev was not known. <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON>'s telephone was disconnected, the same source said. The Associated Press tried to reach <PERSON> Manolov </PERSON> by telephone from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. There was a free signal but it sounded distorted and no one picked up the telephone.

 The arrest and indictment of a male go-go dancer in a string of 24 rapes over five years has eased tension in the victimized neighborhoods, a community leader says. `` The heat is off,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which held a training session in November on how to fend off a rapist. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, 27, was indicted Tuesday on 152 counts, including rape, kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault and grand theft. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>, an assistant county prosecutor, said it was the biggest indictment he had ever seen. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> was already in jail on 27 charges, including rape, after failing to post $ 200,000 bail, said his attorney, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON>. The dancer was arrested Dec. 30 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after he was photographed at an automatic teller machine using a bank card belonging to one of the rape victims, police said. Authorities said the rapes took place between 1983 and last November. Most of the victims were women in their 20s who were alone at home, police said. The assailant often took the victim's bank card and forced her to reveal the personal identification code necessary to withdraw money, police said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules YMCA Is Taxable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> should pay taxes because the doctors, lawyers and others who use the facility are not legitimate subjects of charity, a judge ruled. <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ruled Wednesday that the $ 7.5 million downtown <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> does not meet the state's legal definition of a charity and is not entitled to a tax exemption as a charitable institution. The ruling could require it to pay more than $ 200,000 in property taxes a year. The <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> said it will appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> does not have to serve the poor exclusively to be tax-exempt, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisture </PERSON>, associate general counsel for the national <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Its basic mission is community service that extends to all income levels,'' he said. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> found an elite, upscale operation, that would be taxed under current law, and we think that is the right dividing line.'' <PERSON> Boisture </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> case is n't viewed as a `` major trend-setting case around the country.'' `` It's only one case,'' he said. But he added, `` We're not going to lie down and play dead when we get a ruling that says a Y is taxable. We're going to appeal that and also go to the Legislature.'' The judge cited a 1985 state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case that said an institution is a `` purely public'' charity if it advances a charitable purpose, donates a substantial portion of its services or benefits a substantial group of people who were legitimate subjects of charity. Organizations that relieve the government of some of its burden or operate free of the profit motive also can be classified as charities, according to the law. `` He seems to have ignored all of the evidence regarding the thousands of people annually who benefit for free from the numerous programs and the more than 40 organizations and thousands of children who use the Y each year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wently </PERSON>.

 A woman had an amiable conversation with her ex-husband shortly before he apparently locked himself and their two children in his truck, doused everyone with gasoline and set a fire, police said. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbrew </PERSON>, 29, and his children, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Fecia </PERSON>, 5, were dead by the time rescuers arrived. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> teen-ager was in critical condition today after her boyfriend poured gasoline on her head and set her on fire, police said. In the <LOCATION> Flowood </LOCATION> fire, investigators believe the children may have been dead before <PERSON> Bilbrew </PERSON> set the blaze Wednesday in the parking lot of the hospital where his former wife worked, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, an arson investigator for the <LOCATION> Rankin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. All three bodies were burned beyond recognition. <PERSON> Bilbrew </PERSON>'s ex-wife, Connie, a cafeteria worker at the Woman's Hospital, told authorities he called her 1 -LCB- hours before the bodies were found `` There was nothing indicating what was ahead,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. `` He was not violent on the phone and there was nothing out of the ordinary.'' However, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Bilbrew </PERSON> told police the couple divorced about two years ago but lived together for about a year until they split up again a few weeks ago. There were no witnesses to the setting of the fire, but <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he thought the children `` had met their demise before they ever came to this parking lot.'' `` I do n't know anybody's children who would n't scream and holler ... if someone was rendering these children helpless. Someone would have heard them scream. There are people in this parking lot all the time and on the road,'' he said. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said hospital personnel noticed the fire only after the explosion of some shotgun shells in the locked, burning truck. He said no gun was found in the truck, although a knife was recovered. He also said no gasoline container was recovered. Mrs. <PERSON> Bilbrew </PERSON> was inside the hospital when the fire occurred, and <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said she had to be sedated after being informed of the deaths. He said she would n't be questioned at length until Friday at the earliest. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the woman had custody of the children, but they had been visiting their father, a self-employed concrete worker, since Monday because an ice storm had closed schools this week. In the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> incident, a 17-year-old whose name was not released was in critical but stable condition at a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, hospital, with burns from the waist up, said said <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durr </PERSON>. The girl and her boyfriend `` had argued the night before and he drove to her house shortly before noon Wednesday to collect clothing and other items,'' <PERSON> Durr </PERSON> said. `` It was then that he allegedly poured the gas on her and lit it.'' <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Duck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, was freed on $ 10,000 bail after being charged with aggravated assault.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today demanded the removal of a Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commander who compared the expulsion of nearly 80 people from Israeli-controlled territory in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to steps <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> took in World War II. Lt. Col. J.E. <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON>, commander of the Norwegian battalion in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, made the comparison last week in a private meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. He was protesting the expulsions of 79 Lebanese from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security zone, which he said were carried out by Israeli-backed Christian forces and Lebanese working for the Israeli Shin Bet security service. His remark was leaked to the press, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> complained at the time However, the ministry now wants him removed because he was quoted by a newspaper as saying his comparison succeeded in drawing attention to the expulsions, a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on condition of anonymity. `` In light of the fact that the battalion commander is repeatedly uttering his despicable opinions, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expects the <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> command to draw the proper conclusions regarding the officer,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The dispute over <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON>, 43, began Thursday when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officers met to discuss the expulsions. `` In World War II, my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in the struggle against the <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON>, who were trying to expel Jews from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Nowadays, you behave in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> exactly as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did,'' newspapers later quoted him as saying at the meeting. After Nazi forces invaded <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in 1940, they expelled people from much of the north to create a military zone. They burned homes and other buildings. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up the 6-to-10-mile deep security zone north of its border in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, ending a three-year occupation that followed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion. The zone is patrolled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, an Israeli-backed militia largely made up of Lebanese Christians. Most of the population of the area is Shiite Moslem.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today he's known for a month that the public would n't accept enactment of a congressional pay raise without a vote, but could n't convince his colleagues. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended his handling of the pay raise proposal, overwhelmingly defeated Tuesday. `` I've known for weeks that ultimately there would be a vote,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters. `` I tried to suggest ... there would be a vote. I've known for four weeks that 50 percent was n't going to wash.'' The raise would have become law Wednesday unless both houses voted to stop it The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did so last week, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had devised a plan to let the raise become law, and schedule a vote today to scale it back to 30 percent, along with a ban on speaking fees. Raise opponents, however, forced <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to schedule a vote Tuesday and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, under tremendous public pressure, rejected the increase 380-48 when confronted with taking a public position. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the same language later in the day, 94-6. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters today that `` it was already too late'' to avoid a vote when he devised his 30 percent strategy a week ago. But he added, `` If I had called for a vote sooner, members would have said I gave away their pay raise.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also said reforms in the practice of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accepting honoraria would not be considered anytime soon, nor would the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> take up another pay plan in the near future _ whether for judges, lawmakers or the executive branch. Had the congressional pay raise debate turned out differently, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would most likely have been voting today to deny themselves honoraria, as the speaking fees are known. They may also have been deciding to limit the time members could spend at a conference in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> or elsewhere to give a single speech. And they may well have been closing a loophole that permits <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members in office before 1980 to convert leftover campaign cash to their personal use. The reforms vanished with Tuesday's vote on the pay raise. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were moving to restrict outside income if they could get a pay raise. Not any longer. The reforms now would mean a loss of income, and members are in no mood to take a pay cut. `` I do n't see us tackling it -LRB- honoraria -RRB- very soon,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership aide, requesting anonymity, who described the chances for reform as `` somewhere between negligible and nil.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in fact, voted unanimously last week to ban speaking fees, but made the action contingent on congressional salaries rising from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. The salaries were due to rise at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday if both houses had not stopped it, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> honoraria ban would have kicked in at the same time. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, bipartisan negotiators had fashioned a package that included the honoraria ban, the travel restrictions, ending the campaign cash loophole and other outside income restrictions. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had devised a strategy to let the 51 percent raise become law Wednesday, and have the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote today on scaling it back to 30 percent while also voting on the outside income package. The plan collapsed under relentless public pressure against the raise. Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, will continue to fight the honoraria system, said its president, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>. The group supported the defeated pay raise plan along with an honoraria ban. `` Our view is, this is not legitimate money,'' he said. `` The system is corrupt and unacceptable. We will press to end the system. It's going to be a fight. I ca n't tell you how long it's going to take. I do not think the system will survive in the long term.'' Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., perhaps predicted the future when he said this week: `` No one has raised his hand for a pay cut, so I hope we can go on as we have been. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s honoraria champion in 1987, with $ 106,050 in speaking fees, more than any other senator that year. He gave $ 80,000 of the amount to charity. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> allows its members to retain $ 35,800 a year in honoraria and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> permits retention of $ 26,850. That earning capacity would be lost if the system was ended without a corresponding pay raise. Although senators unanimously voted last week to ban honoraria if the pay raise had become law, many <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members suspect senators like the system that gives them $ 9,000 more in compensation than the House. `` A lot of people want to see what happens in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' before tackling honoraria in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., said Wednesday

<HEAD>Lawmakers Introduce Bill for New Mexico Nuclear Waste Depository</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressmen from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> introduced legislation today to pave the way for the opening of the nation's first permanent nuclear waste repository. The bill, sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Idaho </LOCATION>, also was designed in part to avert the forced shutdown of a plutonium processing plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> that is a vital link in the nationwide nuclear weapons complex. The legislation would authorize the transfer of more than 10,000 acres of federal lands in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the jurisdiction to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. It also authorizes payments of $ 250 million to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for costs related to building the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The repository is being mined from salt beds deep beneath the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> desert and was to open last October. It developed water leaks, and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not set a new date for opening the site. The delay in opening the repository has caused a major problem for the states of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> late last year barred the shipment of wastes from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant to temporary disposal sites in his state. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, in turn, has said it will close the Rocky Flats plant in May unless a new waste storage site is found for the contaminated materials that are building up at Rocky Flats just outside <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> has said he would reconsider his barring of waste shipments to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> if legislation were introduced to speed the opening of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> repository. `` This was the last piece of the puzzle,'' said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>. He added, however, that he was not sure <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> was ready to reconsider the ban.

 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> must pay $ 114,000 to a woman injured in a crash that a jury blamed on the gas pedal and brake being too close together, a state appeals court has ruled. A three-judge panel Wednesday reinstated a verdict in favor of <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. She was injured along with her three children when an <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 smashed through their apartment in 1983. The car's driver, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, told police the automobile lunged forward suddenly. Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hely </PERSON>, contended that <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> knew the accelerator and brake pedal had been put too close together and sometimes caused drivers to step on both simultaneously, prompting the car to lunge forward. A Superior Court jury in March ordered <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> to pay Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> $ 100,000 in punitive damages and $ 14,000 in compensatory damages. The judge set aside the punitive damages, finding there was no proof <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> knew the car had problems and failed to correct them. But the appellate court reinstated the full amount. `` While the evidence to support punitive damages was not overwhelming, we are satisfied that a jury could reasonably have concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> was guilty of deliberate acts of omissions with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm or reckless indifference to the consequences,'' the court said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said the company may seek another appellate hearing. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that it would take corrective measures to `` prevent inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same time,'' according to court papers filed by <PERSON> Hely </PERSON>. Internal <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> documents and a government report conclude that the pedals were close enough that the accelerator often is pushed when the driver tries to brake, <PERSON> Hely </PERSON> said. The documents show <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> knew about the problem as early as 1979. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment about the internal documents filed by <PERSON> Hely </PERSON>. The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group, has charged that more than 1,650 accidents have resulted from <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s that inexplicably surged forward. More than 400 people have been injured and five killed in those accidents. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> has had poor sales since the unintended acceleration charges arose. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales were 60,000 cars in 1986, 41,000 in 1987 and 23,000 in 1988, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, an auto industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Geothermal Field Could Be Biggest in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A geothermal field on the southern island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> could produce 250 megawatts of electricity and become the largest in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a construction company said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Fujita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said one well that it drilled a year ago in <LOCATION> Oita </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> had been proved to be the largest producer of steam and hot water in the world, issuing 120 tons of steam and 100 tons of hot water an hour, enough to produce 20 megawatts of electricity. Spokesman <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyagishima </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fujita </PERSON> was digging several more wells in the geothermal field and had a plan to build 30 wells to produce 250 megawatts of electricity with an investment of $ 1.2 billion. But he said <PERSON> Fujita </PERSON> had not approached the local utility about building the plant, nor had it asked the national government for financial aid. If the field is fully developed, it would more than double the current national total of 215 megawatts of electricity from geothermal sources, <PERSON> Fujita </PERSON> said. Press reports said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> still would trail the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because one field there has a generating capacity of 1,900 megawatts. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, despite its many volcanos and hot springs, has not devoted much effort to exploring geothermal energy until recently. Its main drive has been into nuclear reactors, which supplied 29 percent of the country's electricity in 1987. The government has approved a plan to double the output of nuclear power plants by the year 2000. A nuclear reactor usually produces more than 1,000 megawatts of electricity, or more than four times the output of the projected geothermal field in <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral rites Feb. 24 will last more than 13 hours, the palace said Thursday. Palace officials released a final draft of the funeral day schedule, beginning with an early morning religious ceremony at the palace and finishing with another at 8:50 p.m. at the imperial mausoleum, 28 miles outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The estimated 10,000 guests, including dignitaries from 134 nations, will begin assembling hours before the start of the 67-minute state funeral, scheduled to begin just before noon in the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Gardens in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the officials said. The day has been designated a public holiday. After one minute of silence, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the leaders of the two houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaguchi </PERSON> will address the funeral gathering. Foreign heads of state or government or their representatives will then line up to pay last respects to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who died of intestinal cancer Jan. 7 at age 87, served as the high priest of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Shinto religion, and four of the five scheduled rites will be religious in nature. Controversy has been growing regarding governmental funding of the funeral. Leftist opposition leaders, academics and citizen groups have charged that the government is violating a constitutional separation of church and state. But palace officials, in unveiling funeral preparations, said most funeral guests would not be involved directly in religious ceremonies or would be allowed to decide for themselves if they wanted to take part. The Sojoden-no-gi, the main Shinto funeral rite lasting 47 minutes, is to proceed in a sanctuary adorned with sacred trees and a Shinto archway just before the state funeral starts. Imperial family members will attend, while the mourners, including the prime minister and other government leaders, will observe the ceremony from two tents facing the sanctuary. The state funeral will be followed by a 95-minute procession to the western <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Hachioji </LOCATION> and a Shinto entombment ceremony extending until 8:20 p.m. `` The state funeral ends when the procession reaches its destination. ... From there on it's up to participants to decide for themselves if they will continue to take part,'' one official said.

 A man who grew up thinking that his mother had died in a farmhouse fire was reunited with her after learning that she had spent 64 years in a sanitorium. `` This has been unexplainable joy,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON> said. `` God has permitted me to know and be able to express my love to my mother.'' <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, was 4 in 1925 when he and his father survived the fire in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He grew up thinking his mother, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, died in the blaze, but she had actually been diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia and put in a county sanitorium. She apparently suffered severe trauma during the fire, and her husband was ashamed to admit her condition or whereabouts to others, according to the family. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON> remarried in 1948 and he and his second wife died in 1976. `` When he was dying, my sister spent time with him, and he would say something about <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> and the fire. She could n't tell exactly what he was saying, but now she knows,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON> mentioned to his daughter, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON>, his memories of the fire and his mother. In one scene, he was sitting with his father on a bench in a red-brick building with white wood trim and shiny floors while in the background, a woman swept the floor. `` Dad said the building reminded him of a hospital or institution,'' <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> recalled in a story in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. So, trying to track down details on her grandmother, she began calling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospitals, starting with <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. She asked the information operator if she knew of a hospital in a red-brick building with white trim. The operator gave her the number of <ORGANIZATION> Binghamton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. They called three days after Christmas. `` My brother and I were talking, and I asked him, ` What if she's still alive?' she said. `` He said that was impossible, because she would have had to have been more than 100. Well, he was close. We -LRB- dialed -RRB- the number and asked if they had a patient named <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON>. And the receptionist said, ` Just a minute, I'll ring that floor.''' They reached a supervisor and explained who they were and who they were looking for. `` We all broke out in tears,'' <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> said. `` God just led us to her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Daniluk </PERSON>, it seems, had been led to believe her son had died in the fire. Hospital officials warned the family not to expect too much from the woman, now 95. She had become violent during her hospitalization and in 1955 was given a prefrontal lobotomy, an operation used at the time for certain treatments. But after a recent visit they were left with no doubts. `` When she was happy, she'd clap her hands to the tune of a polka. There's no doubt she knows,'' <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> said. `` She may not know we're her grandchildren, but she knows it's family,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, a ward of the state since 1925, is too fragile to be moved to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and will remain at the hospital, the family said. `` She is well taken care of,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said. `` The people there are really her family. They care for her as if she were their own.''

 A delegate to parliamentary talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Thursday urged the communist nation to retract its decision to call off a meeting between the two nations because of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. `` Along with all people who yearn for fruitful results of the dialogue, we feel very much regretful -LRB- about the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> decision -RRB-,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mun-shick </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speaker. He called on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to continue the talks `` in the interest of national harmony and unification.'' <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> heads a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation to parliamentary talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The talks cover a non-aggression pact and other measures aimed at easing tension between the nations. Delegations of lawmakers from both sides have met seven times to prepare for a joint meeting of their full legislatures. Another round of talks was to be held Friday. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> announced Wednesday that the Friday meeting must be postponed until after the joint `` Team Spirit'' training exercises are over. <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> said the joint exercises are defensive and have been conducted annually since 1976. `` In fact, our side has informed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in advance of the exercises and even invited them to observe the open and defensive nature of the training,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also conducts joint military exercises with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> noted the North Korean radio broacast came only 30 minutes after the breakdown of another set of talks between the nations aimed at preparing the first meeting of their prime ministers. `` This all gives me the impression that they had a pre-planned scenario to embarrass our side and dump responsibility on us,'' he said. The military exercises have been conducted in various parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since 1976 to train the joint command system of the two countries in the event of an invasion. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950, starting a three-year war. This year's `` Team Spirit'' exercises began last week with about 200,000 troops taking part. The maneuvers usually last about two months.

 Jamaicans voted today in an election that was expected to unseat Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> and return socialist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> to power. One person was reported killed and six injured in scattered violence. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Glenna </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 25, a homemaker, died when a gunman fired at party supporters accompanying a local candidate in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said another person was stabbed and five were wounded by gunshots in separate incidents today. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' killer fled, said the spokesman, who did not give any of the victims' party affiliations. Shortly before the polls opened at 7 a.m., a man was shot at a <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> polling station. The police spokesman said he was shot in the chest and was in serious condition. The independent <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> station identified the man as <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kettle </PERSON> and said he was shot in the backside by a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver wielded by one of eight <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> supporters who converged on the polling RJR began its 7 a.m. newscast with a prayer from the Rev. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who reminded listeners it was the beginning of Lent and said, `` Let no one of us be guilty before God of aiding or abetting any violence.'' Twelve people have been killed and scores wounded since the campaign opened Jan. 15. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who since the 1970s has moved toward the political center, was rated a 14-point favorite _ 57 percent of the vote to 43 percent _ in the last opinion poll Sunday. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> was seeking a third consecutive term, something no Jamaican government has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944. Pollster <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indies </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would probably capture 48 of the 60 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The pollster has correctly predicted the winner of every Jamaican election since 1972. Today is <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s first nationally contested election since 1980. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over voter registration lists, giving <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s center-right <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> all 60 parliamentary seats. There were allegations of voting irregularities on both sides. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said he witnessed `` verbal harassment'' of supporters at one station during a morning tour of polling places. That station also lacked the red ink voters are supposed to dip their fingers in to prevent double voting, he said. `` They were just openly breaking the law, creating an atmosphere of hostility,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said. But he added the irregularities were not widespread, `` just the odd incident so far, but one is monitoring the thing.'' Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramacon </PERSON> of <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s party accused <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s party of ballot stuffing in at least one constituency. Military helicopters flew over the capital of 1 million on election eve as part of a nationwide security operation involving 10,000 soldiers and police. Violence has been confined mainly to <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>'s slums, where heavily armed gangs have traditionally controlled large voting blocs, and rural areas far from the big tourist hotels on the north coast. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> signed a peace accord in August in an attempt to prevent violence, but throughout the campaign they accused each other of breaching it. The charismatic <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, 64, educated at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. He has projected a moderate, pro-U.S. image in contrast to his previous far-left leadership. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said he would restore relations with neighboring communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during his first year in office but only on a restricted and formal basis. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> broke relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> upon taking office in 1980. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, 58, who was born in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and educated at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, has been one of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' closest allies in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. He has helped restore <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s battered economy, but higher taxes and devaluation of the Jamaican dollar have cut deeply into the purchasing power of most wage earners and the standard of living of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s 2.4 million people has continued to fall.

<HEAD>Lawyer Known for Adopting Third-World Children Charged with Sexual
Abuse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer who adopted at least 16 children, mostly from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, has been charged with sexual abuse amid indications of `` wanton sexual activity'' at his home, a prosecutor said. A 12-year-old blind girl from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> told investigators she was molested repeatedly by <PERSON> Theadore </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, 46; his adopted son, <PERSON> Kori </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, 30, a former reserve sheriff's deputy; and at least one juvenile in the home, according to documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> Clallam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Police are also investigating claims of sexual abuse by several children in the <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION> household, which once was praised in a nationwide broadcast by author and minister <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Peale </PERSON>, the documents said. In the documents, county Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruneau </PERSON> wrote that `` such disclosures by multiple victims and multiple abusers show a pattern of wanton sexual activity within that residence, and certainly tend to corroborate the continuing disclosures by the victim of the sexual abuse of her.'' The elder <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> will plead innocent when he is arraigned Friday on a charge of second-degree statutory rape, said his attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine. `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> adamantly denies the charges. We're hoping for a speedy resolution of the case and we're confident that ultimately the truth will come out,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> remained free on personal recognizance but was barred by court order from trying to visit the girl. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, social work supervisor in the local Child Protective Services office, said the girl had been declared a ward of the state and placed in a foster home, but three minor children remain with the Ripleys. State officials have begun an investigation of the household, including a review of the license for <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, an adoption agency at the <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION> home. Last month <PERSON> Kori </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> pleaded innocent to a charge of sexual assault in 1984 on the Guatemalan girl, who had been living with <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> and his wife, Merrily, since infancy. Trial was set for March 17. Mrs. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, who runs the adoption agency, has not been charged in the latest case and is not mentioned in any of the associated court papers. In July a juvenile boy living in the <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> home was convited of assaulting the same girl and was sentenced to 22 weeks in a juvenile institution. It was that case that led to the charges against <PERSON> Kori </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theadore </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruneau </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peale </PERSON> praised the Ripleys in a nationwide broadcast for adopting children from other countries and bringing them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to newspaper accounts which said there were 18 children in the household in February 1980.

<TEXT>
 Sales by Americans to 12 West European countries will reach the level of imports by the end of this year if present trends continue, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. `` That's not a prediction, it's a projection,'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargo </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, told reporters. He told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> rose more than 25 percent last year while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports rose 5 percent, changes which cut the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with the community to $ 13 billion from $ 24 billion in 1987. Another year of those trends and the deficit will disappear, he said. He pointed out that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and their affiliates sold more than $ 600 billion worth of goods to the 12 countries last year, three times as much as to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and four times as much as to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. For many years after World War II, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> exceeded imports. In recent years, that trend has reversed. The 12 countries in the community are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. They are now trying to turn their association into a single market, almost as integrated as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by the end of 1992. Some Americans see that movement as a threat of a `` Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' which would keep out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods. `` On balance 1992 should benefit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vargo </PERSON> told the committee. He said faster growth should furnish a better market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. But he said there are many problems remaining, especially in the common standards being set by the 12 governments for imported products and the possibility that tests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products to see that they meet those standards will be required on European soil. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s chief counsel for advocacy, urged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies to set up a subsidiary in one of the 12 countries. `` The consensus is that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> single internal market will materialize, if not by 1992, then shortly thereafter,'' he said in testimony for the committee. `` Establishing a subsidiary in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would be the safest option, although it also could be the costliest choice initially,'' he said.

<HEAD>`New Class' Sabotaging Gorbachev's Reforms, Article Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` new class'' of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government bureaucrats is sabotaging President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, and the Soviet leadership is unable to combat it, a daring magazine article says. Direct criticism of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program has remained largely off limits, despite his policy of greater openness in society. But <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>'s article in the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> monthly Neva is one of the harshest and most detailed attacks yet on the communist system and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies. The party general secretary _ the post <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> holds along with the presidency _ remains `` an inaccessible and exemplary figure'' and his attempt to make the system democratic still leaves the people politically powerless, <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> wrote. `` All decisions of the upper powers are carried out only to the extent that they are advantageous to the new class,'' <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said in the 28-page essay in the January issue of the literary and political magazine. He said the new class is a `` production and managerial apparatus'' of 14 million party bureaucrats, government ministers and managers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself has launched a war on bureaucrats who interfere in day-to-day decisions about production and has tried to transfer some of their power to local officials and factory managers. He often blames bureaucrats for the slow pace of reform. But <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has n't gone far enough and that the new class controls the government and party. `` Both the Soviet -LRB- government -RRB- and party organs have turned out to be subordinate to its interests,'' he said, adding that the model government of the people has been replaced by the `` dictate of the new class.'' <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, 34, is a biologist and plant director who said he represents a new political club called `` Alternative.'' He mocks the party's claim of popular support and uses `` gensec'' in referring to the general secretary. The abbreviation may be used in colloquial speech but is n't seen in the state-run press. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>'s use of the term `` new class'' appeared to be a reference to <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON>' book `` The New Class,'' which criticized the Communist system. The Yugoslav politican and writer, who broke with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s leadership, said in the 1957 book that the Communist system had produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless society. The new class, <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> wrote, is largely responsible for the lack of major improvements in the Soviet economy and for impediments to democracy that have arisen since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985 and the next month launched his program of reforms known as `` perestroika.'' `` We must admit that the economy is in a crisis. ... For the years since the memorable April plenum of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the economy did n't get on track. ... The crisis, in this way, is deepening,'' <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said. He said politicians no longer tell the producers what to do, but that `` new class'' uses party bodies to give orders to the society. Perestroika is moving slowly not because of some mysterious forces, but because of `` well-organized sabotage,'' he wrote. Some Soviets have written letters to the editor claiming factory managers and others are sabotaging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms by withholding food and consumer goods from store shelves. The 57-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief has admitted perestroika is not moving as quickly as he had hoped, but reaffirmed his commitment to reform and said the people support his program. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, however, said the current leadership is partly to blame for economic woes because it has n't kept its promise to let unprofitable businesses go bankrupt. `` The good promises made from high rostrums hang in the air and are far from fostering the strengthening of faith in the possibility of perestroika,'' he said. The article also criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political overhaul under which a new, more powerful legislature and presidency are to be created this year. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary and president _ or head of the legislature _ should not be held by the same man, as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposes, because the lawmakers are supposed to check the work of the top political figure. Despite the party's claim that it serves the people and is in the `` vanguard of society,'' the general population `` practically never had access to the real levers of power and does n't have it now, either,'' he said. On the world scene, the Soviet brand of socialism has a `` demoralizing influence'' and is perceived as `` capable of leading only to collapse,'' he said.

 The wife of spy <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> has refused medication, slowed her intake of food and worsened an eye injury by rubbing it, the medical director of a federal prison-hospital testified today. `` In the long term, it is Mrs. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> that needs to seek psychological care,'' Dr. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Grogan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said at a hearing on whether <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON> is getting adequate care for several painful conditions. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, 34, was convicted in 1987 of supplying classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents and is serving a life sentence in a prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>.

 Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday promised all-out opposition to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains `` I'm not about to tell the wage earners in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that they should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I personally will strongly resist any efforts to undo -LRB- the 1986 -RRB- tax reform, including the return to a preferential tax rate for capital gains,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. He spoke eight hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was delivering a package of budget recommendations that was expected to include a call for lower taxes on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets. There is strong support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, principally among Republicans but even among some Democratic liberals, for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than applies to wages and other income. Capital gains and most other income now are taxed at rates of either 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent. Seventy percent of capital gains are taken by people with incomes above $ 100,000 a year. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has emphasized on other occasions that restoring a preference for capital gains would threaten the landmark 1986 tax overhaul, which was characterized by a significant cut in tax rates for most Americans and a reduction or elimination of several deductions and credits. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> sounded another familiar theme at the press club: Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledges, any realistic plan for reducing the budget deficit must include tax increases, he said. `` If President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is willing to put all spending and revenues on the table, he will find a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> willing to make the tough choices that real deficit reduction requires,'' he said. The veteran lawmaker said that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had also made a no-tax pledge but that during his eight years in office, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raised more taxes than any peacetime president.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed more than a dozen tax increases. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said the 1990 budget left by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was based on highly optimistic projections on how the economy will perform. `` Does anyone really believe that real growth will be 3.2 percent this year? Or inflation at 3.8 percent? Or short-term interest rates at 6.3 percent?'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> asked. `` Those are the numbers in the last <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget. `` I hope I do n't see them in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget,'' he said. `` I do n't want to raise taxes, but I wo n't participate in a sham.''

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A council summoned by Afghan guerrillas meets Friday, charged with choosing a government to replace the Marxist regime, and the main question is whether moderates or Islamic fundamentalists will prevail. The 526 delegates to the council, called a shura, include Moslem guerrillas who have fought the Afghan and Soviet armies for a decade, ministers who served the former monarchy, scholars and other exiles. They are scheduled to meet for three days at a religious complex on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Guerrillas with assault rifles patrolled the grounds Thursday and all cars were examined at the gate. Insurgent leaders organized the council and gave it the specific task of choosing an administration to oversee elections in guerrilla-controlled areas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in the refugee camps <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. More than 5 million Afghans, about one-third of the population, have fled to the two neighboring countries since the civil war began after a communist coup in April 1978. Most went to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, a spokesman for the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said he feared fundamentalists among the seven major insurgent parties based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would would resurrect an earlier guerrilla government they had controlled. `` We do n't want an extremist-dominated government ... because they wo n't do anything about an election,'' he said. `` We will boycott it if they insist on the revival of the <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> government.'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, a leader of one of the fundamentalist parties, was to have been president of a provisional regime the guerrillas chose a year ago, but it never became functional. <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>'s party supports elections, which would be held over six months and choose a parliament of 350 members. Millions of ballots have been printed. The political strategy assumes the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will fall soon after the Soviet military withdrawal is completed next week. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help fight the Moslem insurgency and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. It is to be completed by Feb. 15. Political leaders of the groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where the guerrilla alliance has eight parties, still were discussing a formula for representation on the eve of the shura. Those based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslems like their host country, were dissatisfied with 60 seats originally allotted by the Sunni Moslems based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who claimed 420. The other 46 places on the shura are reserved for Afghan exiles and `` good Moslems'' who have stayed at home. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is more than 80 percent Sunni Moslem and about 17 percent Shiite. <PERSON> Qaribur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Pakistan-based alliance, said Thursday the coalition in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be assigned 80 seats but he could not predict how many would demand places at the council. `` We have problems, big problems,'' <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> told reporters at the meeting site. Years of quarreling among rebel groups made many Afghans skeptical that the the leaders can put their differences aside and reach consensus. Witnesses said a rally of about 3,000 moderates in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, the Pakistani frontier city where the seven-party alliance is based, ended violently Wednesday when fundamentalists threw bricks into the crowd and attacked the stage area. The rally was organized by Afghans who favor the return of former King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who was deposed in 1973 and lives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Whatever government the shura chooses, the real power will be held by a <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> of guerrilla leaders and their appointees, spokesman for the Pakistan-based parties said. The groups based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have not yet been included in that council and, since doing so would increase the fundamentalist influence `` this is a ... gamble for us and for everyone else,'' said the moderate Nasser-Zia.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s military chiefs on Thursday ordered the evacuation of five villages north of the capital in preparation for an offensive against Moslem guerrillas trying to topple the government. The country's top general, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Assef </PERSON> <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON>, said authorities planned to move residents from the villages of <LOCATION> Shakadara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Karabargh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kalakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bagram </LOCATION> and Mirbachakot. <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON> said the evacuation had not yet begun. He gave no schedule and did not say how many people would be affected. The villages are about 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> along a stretch of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the route departing Soviet soldiers are using to return home before their Feb. 15 withdrawal deadline. `` We are evacuating for security reasons, not to harm them,'' <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON> said. `` These people -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- are highway robbers and plunderers. If the people are not able to move them out, the armed forces will help them. We will defend them.'' Heavy shelling and bombings have been heard in the area in the past week. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday night that Soviet convoys on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> heading home have been shelled only once, and one Soviet soldier was killed. No date was given for the attack. Earlier in the day, however, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` Rebels have not interfered with the withdrawal of Soviet troops.'' Most of <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON>'s 20-minute news conference was spent on political rather than military issues. He and other Afghan military officers refused to disclose the strength of the armed forces, although foreign diplomats have estimated the number at about 140,000. Asked about the ability of the armed forces to defend the country after the Soviet's leave, the general said, `` The army is mighty enough to defend the cause of peace and the people. We have enough people and adequate weapons and our army is qualified to defend the country.'' <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON> refused comment on the morale of his troops. There have been reports some soldiers posted along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway have defected and that two helicopter crews defected Wednesday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Concerns about the Afghan army's ability to defend the capital prompted Western nations to pull out their diplomats. Some diplomats have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will collapse within months after the Soviets are gone. `` This is not the first time the opposition has claimed they will conquer <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. We want to make it clear that the government will survive. No one can conquer <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON> said. Earlier this week, the government said weapons had been handed out to 30,000 members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> to help them defend their homes and neighborhoods. The Soviets entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the government in its war with Moslem guerrillas. Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed last year, they are to have all their troops out by Feb. 15.

 Actor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> is making good progress and is eager to get to work on a film that was put on hold until he has recovered from a near-fatal motorcycle crash, his publicist said. `` Hopefully he will be able to go back to work and get back in the saddle soon,'' <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalman </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, 44, underwent brain surgery after the Dec. 4 crash in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

Ms. <PERSON> Schalman </PERSON> said an independent feature film, `` Howling at the Moon,'' was put on hold when <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> was injured. The movie describes the last day in the life of frontier lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>. <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> was cast to play the lead, Ms. <PERSON> Schalman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, who was initially treated at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, was transferred to a private facility for rehabilitation therapy.

<HEAD>ABA Adopts Guardianship Reform Plan in Response to AP Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a plan to overhaul the nation's guardianship system for the elderly by tightening judicial procedures, requiring more accountability and educating judges and guardians. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, on a voice vote Tuesday, approved the reforms drafted by guardianship experts last summer in response to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> series, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Legal Problems of the Elderly. The AP report, `` Guardianship of the Elderly: An Ailing System,'' found widespread abuse through guardianship, the court-administrated system designed to protect the elderly. Ms. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> policy will be used to help states draft guardianship reforms as well as generate education requirements for judges and those who serve as guardians of the elderly. By itself, it will not change guardianship laws. `` People looking to make changes can use what is now <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> policy as a platform for measuring change,'' she said. `` In daily practice, lawyers and judges could use it as a basis for making changes in their courts.'' The House of Delegates, the policy-making body for the nation's largest lawyers' organization, recommended a broad range of changes, from new court procedures to stricter standards for judges, attorneys and guardians The package also encouraged the legal system to rely more on alternatives to guardianship when appropriate. Under guardianship, old people determined to be incompetent by a court can lose most of their rights, such as deciding where they will live, how they'll spend their money and what kind of medical care they'll receive. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> delegates called for reforms to make the guardianship process more understandable to the elderly, including easy-to-read court petitions and better training for court officers. The package also called for stricter criteria for placing people under guardianship and closer scrutiny of the wards and their finances once they are placed under guardianship. The original proposal had included mandatory legal representation for those facing guardianship and a set of rules for attorneys representing guardians and those facing guardianship. Those sections were dropped at the urging of members of the bar's Section on <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> and Trust, who called for further study. The recommendation came out of a national conference on guardianship last July called in response to the 1987 AP investigation, which looked at the guardianship system in all 50 states and found that many old people are placed under guardianship without legal counsel, often without a day in court. Once the elderly are placed under guardianship, the courts often lost track of them, leaving the wards and their money prey to abuse. AP reporters found many instances of money misspent and the elderly mistreated. The series received the bar association's Silver Gavel Award in 1988.

<HEAD>Wild Golden Eagle Dies After Clinging To Life More Than Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wild golden eagle that had clung to life for more than a week after being shot with buckshot died Thursday, a veterinarian said. `` He was a very magnificent animal, and it's just a shame,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Loran </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON>, a partner at the <ORGANIZATION> Skyline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> who had performed emergency surgery on the bird Tuesday. `` Words just ca n't express how you feel when you put all the effort into it and they die. The eagle, a 10-pound adult male with a 6-foot wingspan, was discovered Tuesday by state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers near <LOCATION> Sharon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON> said it apparently had been shot about a week earlier and was suffering from malnutrition. He and three other veterinarians installed intramedullary pins to hold the eagle's broken bones together and were trying to restore the enfeebled bird's strength sufficiently to transfer it to the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Zoo for full recovery. `` The surgery went very successfully, and the bird fully recovered from the anesthetic,'' <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON> said. `` In fact, during the day yesterday, the bird continually got stronger. By yesterday afternoon, he was occasionally striking at the hand of the person that was feeding him.'' However, <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON> said when he came to feed the bird about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday night, `` I noticed what seemed to be neurological signs developing. I called the veterinarian at the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, and he was n't sure if this was the case. It was just a wait-and-see type of thing.'' The bird died a few hours later. Shooting a golden eagle or a bald eagle carries a federal penalty of up to a $ 100,000 fine or one year in prison. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> has asked for the public's help in identifying the shooter.

 A former state highway official agreed to testify against others and then changed his plea Thursday to guilty to federal charges of extortion and filing false income tax returns, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> resigned in December as one of the three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in the face of the impending charges. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> that <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> had helped in the investigation of other unspecified cases and his `` continued cooperation will include testimony before grand juries and at trials.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>'s sentencing would be scheduled later on the extortion charge involving his acceptance of approximately $ 127,000 in cash from a construction company and three counts of filing false tax returns for 1984-86, during which the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says he underreported his income by $ 190,500. <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>, who was a highway commissioner for 21 years, remains free on a $ 5,000 personal recognizance bond. He also posted a $ 205,000 bond to cover back taxes, interest and penalties. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>, 67, be sentenced to two years on the extortion charge and placed on five years' probation on the income tax charges, as well as a $ 40,000 fine. <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> must pay all back taxes plus interest and penalties. She said the extortion charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine. Filing false income tax returns carries a three-year jail term and a $ 100,000 fine for each count. <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> announced his Dec. 31 resignation in a Dec. 21 statement which said: `` I am resigning because I have made a mistake, and I must now pay the price for that mistake.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> sentenced a second highway commisioner, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON>, 59, to a six-year prison term on a federal extortion charge. He also received a five-year suspended sentence and was ordered to pay a $ 100,000 fine on a tax evasion charge. The three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are elected only from the district which they represent and act autonomously in matters concerning road construction and maintenance within their district. There has been considerable public discussion about changing the system to make the commission a statewide board, but so far the Legislature has taken no action to change the system. In the meantime, special elections have been held to replace <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON>.

 The pilot and first officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 that crashed in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, killing all 144 people on board, were described by friends and family Thursday as enthusiastic, dedicated aviators. `` He just loved motion,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Abington </PERSON>, a pilot and major with the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> who had known pilot <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> since 1975. `` Most of his efforts were invested in the flying business. He really loved it,'' he said. In all, seven crew members, all American, and 137 Italian tourists died when an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> charter jet slammed into a mountain Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The plane, en route from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, was approaching landing for a refueling stop. <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, was engaged to one of the four flight attendants who died, 26-year-old <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Also killed were first officer <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>; flight engineer <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 34, of <PERSON> Rex </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; and flight attendants <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromarty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, 56, of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, a pilot and friend of <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON>'s for five years, said he was `` real easy to get along He was very professional and loved to fly.'' <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> had logged about 8,000 hours in the air and had worked for Smyrna-based Independent for about two years after stints in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said Maj. <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Penuel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> guard's public affairs director. <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> joined the guard in 1974. <PERSON> Abington </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> was still active with the guard. `` He just loved airplanes and helicopters and cars and motorcycles,'' he said. `` You ca n't just use an adjective here or there for a person like that.'' Two of the Georgians killed in the crash, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, were last-minute replacements, called in after regularly scheduled employees were unable to make the flight. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 34, was the sole support for his mother, wife, sister and son, all of whom are natives of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Zeigler </PERSON>, 56, a flight attendant, had made the same flight many times before, said her husband, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, himself a former pilot for Independent Air. `` When she left, I said to her, ` <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, you should n't have to go out again. It's just not right,''' said <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>. `` But she would never turn down a flight. That was n't even supposed to be her flight. They said they needed her and she went.'' `` This is so final. We had been married for 35 years,'' he said. `` You just do n't find people like that anymore. She was a very strong person. She kept our whole family together.'' <PERSON> E.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION> said his 27-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> <PERSON> Raney </PERSON>, was the Independent flight attendant who was supposed to have made the fatal trip. `` She had gotten the flu and could n't go to work,'' <PERSON> Raney </PERSON> said. `` But she's terribly upset because she lost a lot of friends on the plane.'' Ms. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said his daughter loved to fly and was not afraid, despite recent reports of crashes and maintenance problems in the airline industry. Flying `` was a big thing for her,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. `` Because she was going to be married, she did n't think they'd let her continue flying,'' he added `` She probably would have been out of this thing in a month or so.''

<HEAD>Private Factory Forced to Go Public After Attacks, Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of a private factory was forced to give his business to the state after peasants, wanting part of his profits, attacked the plant and officials jealous of his success sued him, a newspaper said Thursday. The report in the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> illuminated some of the problems faced by individual firms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has been experimenting with private enterprise the last few years. Some businessmen have incurred the people's wrath because they fire people as they attempt to break the `` iron rice bowl,'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tradition of lifetime employment Others have been attacked because local residents are jealous of their success. The story of <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianfa </PERSON> falls into the second category. In 1982, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> scrimped and borrowed about $ 9,500 to open an ironworks factory in <LOCATION> Jiangyin </LOCATION>, a small city in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION>. After two years, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> had repaid his debts, `` set down some roots and even cleared a profit,'' the story said. `` But as the sound of the hammer brought profits, so it also brought troubles.'' First, a representative of local government called on him, saying he had to start sharing his profits because his factory was on public land. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> had already agreed to pay the electrical, water and electric plowing fees of 100 households. `` But this little problem was just a sign of things to come,'' the article said. One day a fisherman could n't catch anything in a river near the factory. `` He alleged the hammers of <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianfa </PERSON>'s factory had scared away his fish,'' the paper said. The man gathered about 60 of his friends and they attacked the factory, smashing its windows, cutting its power supply and blocking its docks. Production stopped. `` Even though <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> had thousands of dollars, he could n't get any help, because his factory was privately owned,'' the paper said. `` So <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianfa </PERSON> took one step back in order to go two steps forward and gave the factory to the state-run production team.'' In so doing, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> united his interests with those of a collective. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> signed a contract with the production team, `` changed from ` boss' to factory manager, and under the umbrella of a state-run business, looked forward to the future.'' Soon, government officials from <LOCATION> Wuxi </LOCATION>, a nearby city, came to the factory, `` saying they had received a tip. They wanted to see his books.'' It appeared another government agency also wanted a piece of <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>'s profits. `` This fellow gave his factory to the production team but did n't give it to us,'' the newspaper quoted officials in the other agency as saying `` We've got to send this guy to jail.'' Within days 100 people had signed on to sue <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>. `` But in court there was nothing but silence,'' the report said. `` What crimes did Ren commit? Nobody really knew.'' The only `` crime'' was that <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> had gotten rich. The suit was dropped but the marathon struggle over interests had kept the factory silent six months. In summing up, the story said <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianfa </PERSON> was no Lei Feng, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military hero known for his selflessness. `` But,'' it said, `` he understands that if you want to succeed here you have to have dauntless strength.''

 The judge at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial today sent the jury home until next week after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> succeeded in temporarily bringing the case to a halt. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issued an administrative stay, halting all proceedings, after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, acting on behalf of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, said more stringent controls are needed over classified material <PERSON> North </PERSON> intends to present in his defense. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would `` close up shop'' because a three-member panel of the appeals court issued the stay and has given him no indication when it will rule further on the matter. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the appeals court `` has asked me not to go forward until they have had a chance to look at'' the papers filed in the case. The three-judge panel said the administrative stay was `` to permit the court sufficient opportunity to consider the pending motion.'' The judge said he would reconvene Monday morning to assess the situation. `` It is imperative that the trial be suspended pending the outcome of the pending appeal,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s motion for a stay The department said it was making the motion `` because of the national security equities involved and the highly sensitive classified information that may be compromised if this case is permitted to proceed to trial without correction of the procedures that the district court proposes to employ.'' Minutes after the jury of nine woman and three men, all of them black, was chosen, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> declared his intention to permit the prosecution to begin opening arguments. After a brief recess, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> returned and disclosed the appeals court's action shortly after the jury and six alternates were chosen. The panel of Chief Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> and Circuit Judges <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON> said in a brief order that the stay `` should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request. Earlier, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had denied a motion by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a stay of the trial pending the outcome of its appeal seeking to have more stringent controls on classified material that <PERSON> North </PERSON> plans to present in his defense. In denying the motion, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` the attorney general's belated general appearance is wholly misplaced ... The attorney general's attempt to appeal is ... at odds with the purposes of the laws establishing the independent counsel,'' who is prosecuting the case. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy to criminal division chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, immediately went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to get the trial stopped. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would check with the appeals court `` and ask whether any instructions await me.'' At issue is whether national security will be threatened by disclosure of classified information during <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial on charges of shredding evidence and lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to cover up the Iran-Contra affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stepped into the case Wednesday by demanding censorship control over classified documents that the defense wants to enter as evidence. That position was also opposed by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former White House national security aide. The judge called the department's intervention in the case `` one of the most frivolous motions I have ever seen.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the only person who may make an appeal in the case is the independent counsel, but <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> responded that `` the government's position is that the right to appeal is the attorney general's. In a written order denying the stay, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> wrote that the Ethics in Government Act places all investigative and prosecutorial functions in the `` exclusive control'' of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` Independent counsel <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> opposes the motion,'' he noted. His irritation with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s belated intervention in the case came to the fore on Wednesday when he said constant interruptions by government intelligence agencies threaten to turn the proceedings into a `` cuckoo clock trial.'' The department, prodded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking authority to screen and block disclosure of classified material. `` There is some information that can not be put back in a bottle,'' Deputy Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON> said Wednesday. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said prior rulings in the case already have addressed the issue and installed security safeguards _ without damaging <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s right to a fair trial. `` This is not a trial of national security; it's a trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he was n't going to tolerate a `` cuckoo clock trial'' which would be constantly interrupted by reviews of classified material before it is introduced in the courtroom. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants a court order saying that North can not disclose any classified information unless it is explicitly approved by the court and if the government has no objection to the disclosure. In arguments before <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> has failed to meet standards required by the Classified Information Procedures Act. It said notices from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, which are supposed to spell out what classified material he plans to use at trial, have been `` either totally useless or at best minimally informative.'' Further, it said, `` the court has not ruled on what particular classified information is relevant to the issues that will be tried, and whether it is admissible on some or all issues.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> was angry over the delay as jury selection neared completion. `` You ca n't ride this horse in both directions,'' the judge said. `` You can either move to protect national security or you can move to a fair trial. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says that if push comes to shove, a trial judge has one option, to move toward a fair trial.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled on Jan. 19 that <PERSON> North </PERSON> could introduce classified information if it tends to show that his purpose was not to break the law, or if it tends to show that statements made by government witnesses are false or misleading. He also authorized <PERSON> North </PERSON> to divulge information about coverup attempts by other officials, and about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's attempts to have other countries provide military assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid

 Soldiers rounded up about 175 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Thursday and forced them to sit blindfolded and bound for up to 16 hours in a soccer stadium, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Israeli witnesses said. Riots erupted outside the Megiddo Prison for a second straight day after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports circulated that a second Palestinian had died of wounds sustained in a riot there Wednesday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. Police said an Israeli settler killed when his car went up in flames in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Wednesday appeared to be the victim of a terror attack, but an investigation was continuing. `` It is reasonable it was terrorist,'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> police commander <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcha </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` Even though the results are preliminary, it seems unreasonable there was any other cause.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said laboratory tests determined the car was not hit by a gasoline-filled bottle or firebomb because no glass fragments were found. But the tests uncovered a large quantity of flammable liquid in the driver's seat, the radio said. It said police suspected the car was either hit with a flaming plastic bottle or that gasoline was thrown at it. The settler, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerassi </PERSON>, 38, was the 16th Israeli to die since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 379 Palestinians have died, most from Israeli gunfire. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said 17-year-old <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuhdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeb </PERSON> died after being shot by troops trying to quell Wednesday's disturbance at Megiddo Prison in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army said it was checking the report. The radio said Thursday's riot was quickly subdued by prison guards and there were no casualties. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded nine Palestinians, including a 9-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Mughazi refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. Both were struck in the head with rubber-coated steel bullets, they said. The army did not confirm any of the shootings. Troops with lists of suspects began rounding up Palestinians overnight in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, detaining about 175 in a soccer stadium where they were forced to sit cross-legged on the ground until 2:30 p.m. Thursday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> photographer said. Many were in their pajamas and had their hands tied behind their backs. Some were blindfolded. The Palestinians apparently were suspected of planning an action against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources said. Arab witnesses said the detainees were given water but no food. One of the Palestinians was slapped twice by a soldier, they said. Dozens of the detainees were later moved from the soccer field, apparently to detention centers for questioning, the witnesses said. The rest were sent home. Also Thursday, the army sealed three Palestinian homes and demolished a fourth belonging to Palestinians accused of attacks on Israelis. One of the residences sealed belonged to <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Dadu </PERSON>, who allegedly threw explosives at the home of Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> in the Arab quarter of the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Here is information about the jurors in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial. They were chosen from a pool of 45 picates to the pilots that it may be in their interest to honor a -LRB- Machinists -RRB- picket line,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. `` There appears to be a feeling on the company's part that there is no incentive to negotiate with us, with pilots crossing the picket line. That could be very poor judgment on the company's part.'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said his union was making unspecified preparations in case pilots decided to honor the picket lines, but no final decision would come until an actual strike by the Machinists. The Machinists, meanwhile, were voting on whether to authorize a strike, and militant talk pervaded the ranks. `` We're ready to rock' n' roll,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Majors </PERSON>, a 21-year veteran line mechanic, said after voting to authorize the strike at Machinists Local 702, across the street from company headquarters. `` It's matter of principle, mainly. It's just time.'' Majors referred to the demand for $ 150 million in union wage cuts by the management that was installed after the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, led by Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, acquired Eastern nearly three years ago. Union officials predicted overwhelming approval of a strike, which could come if no settlement is reached in their 16-month-old contract dispute by midnight March 3. The head of the local <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Machinists, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is trying to `` contract out or take the work away'' from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees in violation of federal labor law. `` They are now telling all employees to cease production, wrap up, package and box up the parts and send them out for other people to repair them,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` We're probably going to be in federal court to have that stopped.'' The company has said it would have no comment on the strike vote that began Monday in Eastern locals nationwide. The vote will conclude Feb. 14 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> negotiator is continuing efforts to gain an agreement between the two sides, although no recent progress has been reported. `` We have had tremendous turnout,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, the 4,000-member <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> local's vice president. `` At 6 a.m., they were lined up at the door waiting to come in. In 1 -LCB- hours, we ran 900 people through here.'' As shift changes came, Machinists wearing red union T-shirts marched from the airport to the local hall. The 8,500 Machinists comprise 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s workforce. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that System One, the data-processing unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, is ready to supply volunteer backup workers to handle baggage, aircraft cleaning and other such chores in the event of a strike. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> local vote Thursday followed two days of sporadic job actions by the Machinists at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The Machinists said they were protesting forced overtime. Company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said 100 Machinists involved in a mass walkout Tuesday were given 10-day suspensions and that more such discipline was possible. Eastern said its contract with Machinists includes mandatory overtime if conditions necessitate the extra hours of work. The number of employees participating in Tuesday's three-hour walkout swelled at one point to up to 1,000, and the company said there were two smaller, shorter walkouts Wednesday. Eastern's flight schedule has n't been disrupted, the company said. <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON> said some union members received suspension notices by mail while others were ordered to surrender identification badges when they reported for work. He said the union will appeal the suspensions.

<TEXT>
 Iranian-backed Moslem militiamen on Thursday pulled out of captured villages in the south under terms of a peace accord that ended their nine-month fight with Syrian-allied forces. The fundamentalist fighters of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, took refuge in hideouts in mountains near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security zone. But there was no immediate move by their <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> rivals, the Amal militia, to take over the villages of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouswar </PERSON>. Some angry villagers said they want both militias to stay out. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Raad </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>'s municipal government, walked out of his bomb-scarred house and shouted: `` We do n't want militiamen any more: Neither Amal nor <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Qobeissie </PERSON>, a housewife, yelled: `` The militias have ruined our village! We do n't want them back! `` Three rockets hit our house, but luckily we were hiding in a bomb shelter,'' she said. `` Who's going to compensate us for our losses?''

 Organizers of a world famous dog show ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to remove photographs of dead dogs from an exhibit, calling them shocking and upsetting. One picture showed a pile of dogs killed by injections because their owners could not be found. Another was of a bulging garbage bag captioned, `` This doggy bag contains a dead doggy.'' The society used the photographs in full-page newspaper advertisements Sunday to launch a campaign for a dog registration plan to deter people from buying pet dogs and then abandoning them. It had included the photos in the society's exhibit at the Crufts Dog Show, the 103-year-old exhibition that began Thursday, hoping to enlist the support of dog lovers. The charity said that since government licenses for dogs were scrapped last year, it has had to slaughter 1,000 healthy dogs daily because their owners can not be traced. `` We do not like this horror-comic approach,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinnatt </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that runs the Crufts show.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, unveiled a bill Thursday aimed at clearing the way for opening the nation's first permanent nuclear waste repository. The legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Idaho </LOCATION>, was designed also to end a political impasse between the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the states of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> that threatens to force the closing of a key nuclear weapons facility. The bill would give jurisdiction of more than 10,000 acres of federal lands in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking to gain safety clearance to open the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The waste dump had been scheduled to open last October, but technical problems and questions about the long-term integrity of the repository have delayed the opening. The delay prompted <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> late last year to seal his state's borders against shipments of hazardous wastes from the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, in turn, said it would close the plant in May unless a new storage site is found for the contaminated materials that have been accumulating at Rocky Flats since <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> imposed his ban. Rocky Flats is the only plant capable of processing plutonium for nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> has said he would reconsider his ban on waste shipments to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> if certain conditions were met, including the introduction of legislation to speed the opening of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> repository. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> told a news conference it was not clear whether <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> was ready to reconsider. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said he planned to introduce a bill later this month that would place stricter environmental conditions on opening the repository. <PERSON> Skeen </PERSON> said he and other congressmen with an interest in the waste issue would work with <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> to draft a compromise bill to try to get the pilot plant open by the end of the year. A key point of dispute is how much waste material should be allowed into the site during an initial testing period. <PERSON> Skeen </PERSON> said the matter could not be resolved until the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> furnished more information about its plans for the five-year testing program.

 A Japanese man who allegedly came within two days of blowing up a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building avoided suspicion by buying ingredients for his deadly bombs on a monthlong terrorist shopping spree to art supply, sporting goods and discount stores in 11 states, documents reveal. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, reputedly a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> who received terrorist training in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally last March 8 and then made his zigzag, 7,000-mile trek in a used <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. Court papers show he stayed at motels, bed and breakfast rooms and campgrounds, his travels apparently financed in part by money drawn from a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank account. `` He did n't tell jokes, he did n't laugh, in fact, he looked like a guy with a lot of problems, with a lot of troubles on his mind,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, campground was one of the many places <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> stayed during his trip, said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> His odyssey ended at a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION> reststop on April 12, two days before officials said he intended to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruiting center housed in a Veterans Administration building in retaliation for the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. New Jersey State Trooper <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cieplensky </PERSON> said he noticed Kikumura acting erratically. As <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> drove off, <PERSON> Cieplensky </PERSON> stopped him and found in the back seat a package containing three bombs _ hollowed-out fire extinguishers filled with gunpowder, lead shot and with switchs and triggers. He also found a map which authorities later said showed possible other targets, including three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> college campuses. `` I would hope that at some point he would have made another mistake,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>, who helped prosecute the case. `` But based on his experience and background, I have very little doubt that he would have succeeded in killing people with those bombs.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, claiming the allegations against him were fabricated, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for explosives and weapons charges and carrying false documents, including a passport. Kikumura's attorney, civil rights lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, said an appeal was Investigators used receipts found in <LOCATION> Kikumura </LOCATION>'s car to piece together his movements in the month before his arrest. His travels took him to roadside motels through <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland, across its colonial byways and into the Bible Belt. The documents show he spent time in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Along the way, he bought items such as gas cans, a diet scale, flash bulbs, electrical wire and tape, cements, epoxy glue and fire extinguishers. `` The materials he bought to make the bombs are most always used for legitimate purposes,'' <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> said. `` And when he traveled around to buy the different materials, it decreased the risk of somebody piecing together what he was doing.'' <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s favorite store was K mart, authorities said. `` Turn Mr. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> loose near a K mart and a sporting goods store and in a matter of hours, literally, he can make what was found in his car today,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said during <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s sentencing hearing this week. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> made a rare appearance in court to present the evidence against <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, who had a record for explosives charges and is reputedly a member of the notorious <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a radical leftist group formed in the 1960s to promote world revolution. On May 1, 1986, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> had been arrested at <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schiphol </LOCATION> airport with two pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> and several bomb detonators He spent four months in jail after the courts found that authorities had conducted an illegal search at the airport. His whereabouts over the next few months are sketchy. But from August 1986 until his arrival at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last March 8, he used a stolen and altered passport to travel through <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, authorities said. Prosecutors also said an informant has provided evidence that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> spent some time at a terrorist training camp in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Two days after his arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was sent by a roommate service to the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment of <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brande </PERSON>. `` He was quiet and polite,'' <PERSON> Brande </PERSON>, an accountant, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Looking back now I can see a few strange things, like he said he was a tourist but I never saw a camera. `` He did n't look like a terrorist type, whatever that type is. He just seemed like a nice guy.'' <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> bought a used <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> 626 at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> within a week of his arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and he set out on his tour. On March 16, he was in <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. He traveled west on March 22 on Interstate 80 through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and stayed overnight at the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bed and breakfast in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The next night he stayed at Barnicks Bed and Breakfast in <LOCATION> Diamondsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The Harrison Hotel in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was his home the night of March 24. Two days later, he was in <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s hometown of Hannibal, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. He also stayed March 28 in the Biltmore Hotel in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and on March 29 at <PERSON> Clardy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Guest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. It did n't make his first known bomb-parts purchase, until March 30, when he stopped in an art supply store in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to buy two cans of aluminum powder. The next day he went to K mart in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and in two visits bought gas cans, a diet scale, coffee-maker accessories, a special glue, contact cement, electrical wire and electrical tape. On April 1, he arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION>' campground.

While in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> went to an electronics store and bought a toggle switch, circuit tester, phone jacks, phone plugs and wire. He left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on April 3 and stopped at <LOCATION> Smiley </LOCATION>'s Motel in Hurricane, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on his way back to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Error Delays 450,000 Tax Refunds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A human error in running a computer has delayed 450,000 federal tax refunds by a week, but the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday there is no comparison with the computer problems that made a disaster of the 1985 filing season. `` The situation was uncovered immediately and remedial steps were taken so that no taxpayers were inconvenienced,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said of the latest problem. `` People are going to get their refund checks in the four-to-six-week time frame that is typical at this time of the year,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> director of public affairs. But checks for those who filed in the second or third week of January will be mailed Feb. 17, rather than Feb. 10 as had been planned. Millions of tax refunds were delayed for several weeks in 1985 because of problems with a new $ 103 million computer system. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> was asked whether taxpayers should be worried that the new problem might be the first warning of a recurrence. `` Absolutely not,'' he said. This year, he said, there was no problem with the computer itself or the instructions fed into it. `` The refund checks were in the correct amount, the bills that would have been generated were in the correct amount. `` We learned from the 1985 problems and we wanted to make sure that whatever was needed to be done was done ... that no taxpayer would receive an erroneous notice,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> deliberately delayed mailing the 450,000 refund checks, as well as any tax-due notices arising from returns filed early this year, until the human error could be corrected. That error was made at the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> computing center in <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where all master files on individual taxpayers are kept and where refund checks are authorized The problem occurred because the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> late last year announced that taxpayers in six states _ <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> _ should file their returns to a different service center this year in order to even the workload among the 10 centers where returns are processed. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> taxpayers, for example, used to file to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; now, they file to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But those changes were not taken into account at the <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION> center. Thus, if a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> taxpayer had a question about his or her account or refund, the computer would have generated a notice directing the taxpayer to correspond with the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> center, rather than <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. To avoid such erroneous notices, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> simply delayed the checks. With the exception of that problem, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, the filing season is going well. Through Feb. 3, she said, 8.45 million returns had been filed _ down 7.6 percent from the same time last year _ and 2.75 million had been processed, an increase of almost 14 percent. The figures are in line with recent years, when _ for reasons that neither the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> nor outside experts can explain _ the number of taxpayers filing early in the season declined each year. Through Jan. 27, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had certified 95,000 refunds totaling $ 72 million, an average of about $ 751 per check. The number of refunds was down 12.6 percent and the average refund was up 4.2 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects 109 million returns this year and, as in most years, about 75 percent will qualify for refunds. A check of early returns shows many taxpayers who do not itemize deductions are failing to claim the standard deduction. The agency will correct that error, but any refund will be delayed. Another common error is a failure by a filer _ usually a young person with a part-time job _ to check a box indicating whether he or she can be claimed as a dependent by another. Also near the top of the mistake list are mathematics errors, failure of low-income working families to claim the earned-income credit, and failing to use taxable income to calculate taxes owed.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations probably will hold a summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in May, a source in the Western alliance said Thursday. No final decision has been made on a date or place for the anticipated summit but the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` May is most likely.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been expected to have an early meeting with other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> to discuss pressing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issues and mark the alliance's 40th anniversary.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Thursday that he knew a month ago that the proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise would be put to a vote, that it was too large and `` was n't going to wash,'' but his colleagues would n't listen While defending his handling of the issue, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat also indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would not return to the politically sensitive subject anytime soon, not even for the judges or top federal executives whose increases are linked to congressional pay. When asked if the pay issue would resurface, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` I hope not real soon. I can count.'' The proposed 51 percent pay raise, under heavy public attack, died Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, by 380-48, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by 94-6, passed legislation rejecting the increase and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swiftly signed the measure. At a news conference, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he tried to convince stubborn colleagues the proposed raise was too large, and that public pressure would not let them avoid a vote on the pay plan that had been set to automatically become law Wednesday. On Monday, opponents of raising congressional salaries from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 won a procedural vote, forcing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to schedule a vote on rejecting the raise before Tuesday's midnight deadline. `` I've known for weeks that ultimately, there would be a vote,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I tried to say to my colleagues there would be a vote. I had known for four weeks that 50 percent was n't going to wash.'' But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said legislators were n't willing to listen because, `` if I had called for a vote sooner, members would have said I gave away their pay raise. Asked if he would have done anything differently, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that `` I would have probably have done the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a service if I had been able to prevail on colleagues to see three weeks earlier'' that letting the raise become law without a vote `` was not going to be accepted.'' `` I did n't succeed in that. So be it,'' he said. `` Post-mortems are not really productive.'' Before he gave in, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had planned to seek a smaller raise with steps that would have allowed the 51 percent increase take effect followed by a vote to scale it back to 30 percent the next day. That plan also called for a vote on eliminating acceptance of speaking fees. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he knew such a plan was too late and `` was n't in the cards'' even before he proposed it. `` There was a time when a proposal to do away with honoraria and reduce the increase to 30 percent was justifiable and would have been acceptable, but by the time I advocated it, it was too late,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied that the episode weakened his power, saying members are assuring him every day `` that this is n't true.'' The speaker said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked him if he should propose a smaller increase than the 51 percent and the speaker said he replied, `` I tried that and it did n't work to well for me.''

 About 170 tons of arms confiscated from a Danish freighter might have been destined for rebel movements in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Police boarded the Jenstar on Wednesday and seized 5,217 cases of Czechoslovak rifles, pistols, submachine guns and amunition valued at about $ 8.8 million, the agency said. <PERSON> Tiziana </PERSON> <PERSON> Parenti </PERSON>, the investigating magistrate assigned to the case, told <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> the shipment was believed to be part of a larger plot to arm revolutionary movements in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Consecration Of Female Bishop Won't End Controversy Over Women Of

<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is mustering full pomp and ceremony to install <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the first woman bishop in a 2,000-year <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> line dating to the apostles. The worldwide attention expected for Saturday's events goes far beyond anything the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> usually confronts and reflects a debate that has simmered within church ranks and now threatens to spill over into Christianity at large. Some 8,300 tickets have already been distributed for the consecration. Demand has forced church officials to move the ceremony from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to the cavernous <ORGANIZATION> Hynes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which has room for spectators, a chorus of 130, television cameras and a large contingent of journalists. Though no one is announcing any last-minute effort to block the appointment, a good many of the attendees can be expected to hold their breath when the ritual requires presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> to intone: `` If any of you know any reason why we should not proceed, let it now be made known.'' The 58-year-old former head of a left-wing religious publishing company has been a subject of some controversy within the church since Sept. 24, when the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> elected her suffragan, or assistant bishop. Women have been priests in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> since 1976. But becoming an bishop is a question of much higher magnitude. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> would become the first woman to reach that height in any of the three major branches of Christianity _ Roman Catholicism, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodoxy </ORGANIZATION> and Anglicanism _ that trace bishops in a direct line back to the Apostles of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. After the election last September, debate quickly ensued across the country among 118 church committees responsible for confirming the election. A traditionalist faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, rallied in opposition to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' elevation. Now, prelates and observers on both sides of the issue are concerned that the stakes may be even larger than the unity of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which is a branch of worldwide Anglicanism. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican churches have been involved for more than a decade in discussions over easing their centuries-old differences. `` And they have made great progress,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solheim </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese. `` For Roman Catholics, the idea of a woman standing at the altar representing Christ is totally unacceptable.'' Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in December issued what Solheim called `` ominous noises'' about the impending consecration of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. The pope warned of `` painful and deplorable consequences'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> going forward with the consecration of a female bishop. `` The constant line of tradition, common to all the churches, can not be so easily interupted,'' he said. `` This has great ecumenical consequences,'' said Bishop <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> of the Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. A female bishop might be acceptable if all of Christianity approved in an official way, he said. `` But we're a small church. In taking the leadership in this, we just denigrate the progress we've made in having communion throughout the world. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clementine </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> this week was the calm at the center of the storm, recovering from a head cold on a church retreat. She could not be reached for comment because she has no access to a telephone at the retreat, <ORGANIZATION> Solheim </ORGANIZATION> said. Some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her decidedly leftist political views which she conveyed in the publication, The Witness, issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where she has been an Episcopal priest since 1980. The periodical has published articles supporting homosexual rights and the Nicaraguan Sandinista government and criticizing the church for failing to fully bring women into church leadership. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Politzer </PERSON>, president of the traditionalist <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, described <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as `` pro-Marxist. Her writings are snide and sarcastic. She is unfit to be a bishop.'' Some also have questioned <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' qualifications because of her lack of a college degree and full seminary training. A black woman and a veteran of the civil rights marches of the 1960s, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has been outspoken for civil rights and feminism and she is unapologetic about her views. But at a recent news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> sought to ease concerns by saying her work for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> diocese would focus on sacramental and pastoral duties rather than involvement in political affairs.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Workers closed schools, businesses, and some public transportation Thursday in a general strike called by the opposition to demand the resignation of Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. It was the second day of the strike, but the government blunted its impact Wednesday by closing schools and services with a paid holiday. Thursday was not a holiday. The government also ordered the arrests of seven opposition leaders who called for the strike. By Thursday, there were no reports that the seven had been arrested. Among those sought were <PERSON> Jean-Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesyeux </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Miracle </PERSON>, co-leaders of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s largest union. Their group, the <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, has organized two successful general strikes since November. Meanwhile, about 16 politicians met with government representatives Thursday, the first day of an eight-day forum to discuss general elections. Major opposition leaders <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> boycotted the forum, protesting <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s failure to exclude supporters of former dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>.

 Supplies are so short in Veterans Administration hospitals that nurses are scrounging thee little souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to bring to <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> patients, a nurse told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. Supply accounts are frequently raided to pay salaries and avoid layoffs, an outside medical administrator told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Morissey </PERSON>, a nurse at the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, veterans hospital and prsident of the <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in testimony submitted to the hearing, `` At one VA hospital in the south, nurses were frustrated by the refusal of -LRB- the -RRB- prosthetics -LRB- department -RRB- to supply wheel chair cushions for patients on the long term care unit. `` The nurses obtained a $ 25 donation, went to the local upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress, and with an electric knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses, cut the foam to make wheel chair cushions for their patients.'' She did not identify the hospital, nor the hospital in other anecdotes: `` Nurses in one hospital brought in souvenir hotel soaps and shampoos for the patients, and in another, brought and cut large bars of soap in small pieces for patients to use.'' At her own hospital, she said, `` We can not properly monitor diabetic patients when there are no lancets to do finger sticks, no Chem Sticks for blood samples and no insulin syringes to use to give insulin if it is needed. This is the situation I have faced over the past month at my facility and I thank God there has been no crisis because of it.'' A Soviet report last week of hospital patients getting AIDS from unsterilized needles `` is a startling reminded to us in this country that mistakes can happen when the system starts to cut corners and workers perform daily under inordinate pressure as we do in the VA,'' she said. At congressional hearings last September, <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> officials said they faced a $ 600 million to $ 1 billion shortfall in their $ 10.54 billion budget for medical care in the current fiscal year. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for head of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and secretary of veterans affairs when the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> becomes a cabinet department next month, said Tuesday he had met with Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Declining to say if he thought a supplemental appropriation is needed for the current fiscal year, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said the meeting with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> `` did n't result in any figure changes, but I hope it'll increase his sensitivity. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, vice president for medical affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a member of a <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and a consulting surgeon to two VA hospitals, said, `` By moving funds from other accounts, the Department of Medicine and Surgery was able to remain near the congressionally mandated 194,720 employment level,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>.

No casualties were reported in that blaze, which began in some duty-free shops in the airport terminal building, a senior airport official said on condition of anonymity. The entire airport was evacuated, officials said. There was no word on what started the fire. At least 20 firefighters fought the fire for six hours, news agencies said. There was no immediate report on damages. Flights could not land until the fire was brought under control because safety regulations require that firefighters be on standby for all landings in case of emergencies.

 CBS' `` Lonesome Dove'' wound up 14th on the list of all-time highest-rated network miniseries. CBS estimated, based on figures from the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, that about 40 million viewers tuned in each night of the four-night Western epic that revived network television, at least for the week. CBS Entertainment President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> got a tip of the hat _ literally _ from competitors at an industry luncheon here Thursday. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> presented <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> with a cowboy hat at the annual <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> newsmakers luncheon at the <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>. `` Lonesome Dove'' had an average, four-night rating of 26.1 and a 39 share, far above the below-30 shares that network had guaranteed to advertisers, delighting the third-place network and contributing to combined three-network shares that soared into the 80s on some nights. The season-to-date average for the three networks had been 68. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The top three network miniseries remain `` Roots,'' `` The Thorn Birds'' and `` Winds of War,'' all of which aired on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Lonesome Dove'' became CBS' third-highest-rated miniseries behind `` Master of the Game,'' which ranks 11th on the all-time-high list, and `` Scruples,'' at 13th. The list does not include two-part movies.

<TEXT>
 Helicopters serving one of the few <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> hospitals to perform heart transplants on children are drawing flak from neighbors who say the aircraft are overused and pose a potential safety hazard. However, a hospital official countered Thursday that Children's Memorial Hospital has taken great pains to keep the helicopters' disturbance to a minimum since it began using them a couple of years <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkind </PERSON>, planning committee chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the hospital has failed to obey zoning laws and an agreement with community groups to use the helicopters only for emergencies, trips longer than 40 miles and for its own staff. <PERSON> Malkind </PERSON> testified Wednesday before a hearing officer gathering material on the hospital's application to be certified as a pediatric heart transplant center by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` The helistop is controversial in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> from the standpoint of safety concerns and noise problems,'' <PERSON> Malkind </PERSON> said of the surrounding affluent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` We think it's a very good hospital, we really do,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Giarrizzo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> resident who also attended the hearing, said Thursday. `` We just say, ` Live up to the agreements, follow the laws.''' The suggestion that Children's has violated its agreements or the law is `` totally untrue,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and a representative of the hospital at the hearing. Because donor hearts remain viable for just four hours outside the body, they must be flown into Children's, requiring more helicopter flights, he said. However, he said the hospital goes out of its way to keep helicopter use to a minimum and noted that the total number of helicopter landings and takeoffs actually dropped last year compared to 1987, from 201 to 195. There is no restriction on the number of helicopter flights allowed, <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said. Children's has performed five heart transplants since its first one last May. `` Our estimate is we do not believe more than 12 of these -LRB- transplants -RRB- could or would be done a year, based on the difficulty of getting donor hearts,'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> added. He said quarterly reports on helicopter use, distributed to community groups, clearly reflect the hospital's proper use of the vehicles. `` We took extraordinary efforts to involve the community'' when the helicopter service began, he said Thursday. Sound testing equipment was placed in homes and businesses and community hearings were held to address safety and noise, said <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>. He said he believes only a few people are complaining, and that they are not representative of most of the neighborhood. <PERSON> Giarrizzo </PERSON> said area residents do not oppose certification for Children's, but believe the hospital should be required to tighten up its use of helicopters before it is granted official status as a transplant center. In addition to the many homes around the hospital, a school and a church are right across the street, <PERSON> Giarrizzo </PERSON> said. Safety concerns center on the hospital's use of twin-engine helicopters, which carry more fuel than the single-engine helicopters Children's originally agreed to use and could presumably cause greater damage in the event of a crash, he said. The hospital's bid for certification `` has very little to do with helicopters,'' said <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>. `` It has a whole lot to do with the societal obligation of Children's, which transcends Lincoln Park. It's a societal obligation that an institution of this ilk must fulfill.'' Children's cardiology service treats about 4,000 young people a year, about 10 percent of whom require heart surgery of some sort, making the hospital one of the largest of its kind in the country, <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said. The board of the planning authority is to act on Children's application for certification at its March 2 meeting, said authority executive secretary <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Passeri </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 A new campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to promote the `` scenic byways'' program in national forests got the green light Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A three-way partnership was worked out with the California-based <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to help upgrade designated scenic stretches of highways into major tourist attractions. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the 191 million acres of national forests _ if gathered in one place, an area larger than <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ offer `` some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most spectacular scenery.'' `` This partnership will allow us to showcase the beauty of these areas for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public, nearly half of whom spend part of their leisure time driving for enjoyment,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told a news conference the venture is the first major national cooperative effort undertaken by his agency with a private corporation. The agreement is for three years and could be renewed. The scenic byway program began last year with the designation of a 26-mile stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 64 in southeastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. So far, 30 have been designated, covering 1,676 miles, and others are being identified for addition to the system. One goal is to upgrade the highway areas to make them more useful and entertaining for motorists. Projects can include interpretive signs, improved road maintenance, pullouts at scenic overlooks, parking areas, some rest area facilities and short-loop walking trails. According to an information folder by the non-profit foundation, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> will publicize the byways through `` an ambitious promotional program which includes 20 exhibitions at heavily attended regional consumer shows, discreet signage in 3,500 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> dealerships, and in 700 high-traffic retail locations and ski areas.'' The promotion also includes a national sweepstakes with a <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> as grand prize, which was on display in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s indoor patio, a 4-door mid-size Acclaim with a window sticker listing all the options and a price of $ 14,224. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> and the foundation is strictly on behalf of the byways program and that the company `` will not be using our logo'' on any of its products or is receiving any endorsement by the agency. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Smorra </PERSON>, general marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, dodged reporters' questions about details of the financial arrangement between the agency and the company. <PERSON> Smorra </PERSON> said that he was `` not announcing the exact dollars we're putting into -LRB- the program -RRB-, but it is extensive in terms of communication efforts, as well as promotional efforts. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the budget proposed for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990 fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1 calls for $ 1.5 million for `` challenge cost-share projects,'' which includes the byways program. `` So we would anticipate at least that amount in 1990 _ and perhaps some more of our budget _ going into it,'' he said. The funds call for matching dollars, at least, from approved participants to carry out the cost-share projects. `` There is some up-front cash from <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, but I'm not free to say -LRB- how much -RRB- right now,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said.

 Authorities on Thursday found the cockpit voice recorder of a chartered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jetliner that slammed into a mountain and killed all 144 people aboard, and they recovered the remains of all but two of the dead. Rescuers called off the search for the two bodies still missing, saying it would be impossible to find them on the heavily forested slopes of <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> mountain where the jet crashed Wednesday. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said it was hoped the recorder would help explain why the pilot steered the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 directly into the mountain while trying to land in a fog. The seven-member American crew and the 137 passengers _ Italian tourists headed to a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> vacation _ were killed. In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, Cmdr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON> of the aviation authority said the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, had acknowledged the airport control tower's authorization of a safety altitude of 3,000 feet during the landing approach. Pastor said the plane struck the mountain at an altitude of about 1,700 feet. `` There was no _ repeat no _ communication of an emergency landing request by the pilot,'' he said. Earlier reports indicated the pilot may have asked to make an emergency landing. <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> said it appeared the aircraft had been on the proper course to land. It was to refuel on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> island before continuing on to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> said the cockpit voice recorder had been recovered, but the flight data recorder, which contains information on the aircraft's flight parameters, had not yet been found <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> rescue service, said he did n't believe it was possible to find anything more remains at the crash site on the slippery, dense slopes of the 1,794-foot <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, the highest point on the island. Rescuers found 50 bodies on Wednesday. The smell of oil hung in the damp air, and a light rain fell on debris that included playing cards, a book of fairy tales and vacation clothing, still neatly folded. Members of a six-man team from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, including representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, were expected to arrive to help with the investigation. The jet was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which was expected to send representatives to <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> for talks with aviation officials. The 20-year-old jetliner had a relatively low number of flight hours and no history of serious problems, company president A.L. <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said. The craft, one of two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707s the company owned, had logged 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and fewer than 50,000 hours in the air. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, agreed the figures were not excessive. He said Independent Air was fined $ 18,000 in an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> enforcement action in 1984, but he said it was not possible to learn why immediately. The mayor of <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> checks the airport, used primarily as a mid-Atlantic refueling stop, every six months and that an average of three flights a day stop there. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> is about 750 miles from the Portuguese mainland. The airport, reportedly the largest in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, has no radar but uses an instrument landing system to guide pilots. The remains of the dead were being moved from a makeshift hanger at the airport to freezers at a food processing plant in <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> to await the arrival of an Italian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 transport plane carrying coffins from <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>, Italian investigating magistrate <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Vardano </PERSON> said. There was no immediate information on the identification of the remains of the crew members or when they would be transferred to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The seven crew members were identified as: <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, 1st officer; <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the flight engineer; and flight attendants <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, 24, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, 45, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromarty </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans Dividing on Tower</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democrats said Thursday that Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination will rise or fall on the answers to outstanding questions, but Republicans rallied to his side, one complaining of a `` feeding frenzy'' of allegations. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman who has said he would formally oppose the nomination if a vote were held now, said he'd be ready to work with Tower if the confirmation goes through, no matter how he himself had voted. However, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., also renewed his public doubts, saying, `` There are questions that still have not been answered to my satisfaction I do not foreclose the possibility that there may be satisfactory answers ... but I have not received them yet,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has delayed a committee vote on the nomination at least until Feb. 21 _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be in recess until then _ so the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can review allegations of a financial nature against the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. Other questions involve Tower's use of alcohol, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. His position was echoed by several other Democrats on the 20-member <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which Tower once headed. One of them, Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., said, `` I told Sen. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> that my instincts are very much like his: If the vote were held tomorrow, I could not vote for Sen Tower.'' Republicans, meanwhile, hurried to Tower's defense. `` What bothers me is there is a feeding frenzy here,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss. `` I am worried that we begin to judge this nomination on the weight of the allegations instead of the weight of the evidence. ... Ninety-eight percent of this stuff is totally unfounded.'' Republican Sens. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> also commented in favor of Tower. And the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also pressed Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> into service, telephoning senators on Tower's behalf. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the vice president, a former member of the committee, called about a half-dozen members from each party to `` assure the senators that -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was standing behind'' his nominee. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> called the lengthy review of Tower's personal and professional life `` painful,'' but said if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves him, `` I for one will be leading the way to try to work with him, whatever my vote may end up being.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s background inquiry centers on contributions to one of Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns by a defense contractor now under investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement probe, code-named `` Operation Ill Wind,'' according to an administration official who spoke on condition he remain anonymous. But the official said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Tower. Records on file at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> show that in June 1983 Tower received a $ 500 campaign contribution from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employee under investigation in `` Ill Wind,'' an investigation of alleged corruption in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-year purchasing system. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s donation to the Tower campaign was within the $ 1,000 limit for individual contributions. Telephone calls to <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s home were unanswered Thursday Also Thursday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he was upset at having to take the blame for delaying the Tower vote, a postponement he said was made at the request of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` On the one hand, we're being told to wait because there is a serious allegation initiated by the administration; on the other hand, we're being told that we should vote immediately or that we're being criticized for bringing up new allegations ... So that is a little frustrating.'' <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a White House spokesman, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted a vote as soon as possible, but realized that was impossible until the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was finished Since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected Tower, the ex-senator has been dogged by allegations and rumors that he was a womanizer and excessive drinker, which Tower denies. None of the previous allegations, some spawned by his ex-wife <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and most checked out by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> over the past two months, pose a problem to Tower's nomination, White House officials say. But Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, D-N. Mex., said there was `` no question'' the delay `` is hurting his Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> have also expressed reservations about voting for Tower until they see the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s completed report. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> acknowledged that Tower is not `` Snow White'' when it comes to drinking alcohol, but said, `` I'm convinced he's not an alcoholic, that he does not now have a drinking problem.''

<HEAD>U.N. Observers Say Cementing Iran-Iraq Truce is Slow Work</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers trying to cement a fragile cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> say rival forces still glare at each other from less than 25 yards away in some parts of the front. The peacekeepers constantly patrol the tense front lines, which stretch from the snowy <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountain in the north to the southern deserts. They travel on foot or in military vehicles painted white. `` The temperature in the north today was minus 31 Centrigrade,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealander </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in the southern sector of the 730-mile front between the neighboring nations. `` But here in the south, it was 31 plus. In the north, our observers operate on skis or snowshoes.'' He said the process of cementing the cease-fire is slow work. `` We're still involved in negotiations with both sides about disengagement,'' said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. In the six months since the Aug. 20 U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers have negotiated with both sides to achieve a buffer zone up to 1 \ - mile wide, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> told a group of foreign The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers' base camp, which comprises neat rows of portable cabins pained white, is about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil-rich <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province and one of the most heavily damaged regions during the war. A long drive through the region indicated that life is generally back to normal in the region. <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>, a sprawling market town and oil center, bustled during the day. At night, its wide tree-lined avenues were ablaze with thousands of colored lights strung from lamp posts and buildings for the 10-day celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution. In the flat, dusty countryside near the front, women tilled and watered the fields while men repaired war-damaged buildings or built new houses to replace those lost in heavy Iraqi bombing. In the area around the small town of <LOCATION> Susangerd </LOCATION>, once occupied by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s special Construction Crusade brigades were busy. Helped by villagers, the teams of bearded young men of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> were digging new irrigation canals or extending existing ones with earth-moving machinery. The concrete canals, which could serve as anti-tank ditches if fighting breaks out again, run for miles along the border. Despite the cease-fire, both armies still have large forces along the cease-fire line. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> acknowledged that in some stretches, the rival forces are still only 25 yards apart. He also said truce violations have occurred as reported. `` On the whole,'' he added, `` it's been very quiet. I see no reason why it should n't continue like this.'' He declined comment on a statement by Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> that the Iraqis recently seized 39 square miles of Iranian territory. The Iranians say the Iraqis still occupy a total of more than 380 square miles of their territory. With <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> striving to break the deadlock in the talks aimed at a permanent settlement, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> commented: `` The future is in the hands of the politicians.'' The Iranians have said that resuming talks that broke down in November was futile unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> withdraws from Iranian soil. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejects any preconditions. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday extended the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers' mandate for another six months. It repeated its calls for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to withdraw their forces to the pre-war border, one of the key provisions of the cease-fire resolution passed in July 1987. At least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war, which began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after several border skirmishes. Some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1 million, and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of dollars. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said new officers have been arriving to replace those in the 409-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force from 26 countries. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> reported Wednesday that 10 officers from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and 10 from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will meet in a no-man's land in the central sector this month in an effort to advance the cease-fire provisions.

<HEAD>UNITA Envoy Seeking More U.S. Weapons, Raises Doubts About Cuban
Pullout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An envoy for the rebels fighting the Angolan government said Thursday he is seeking additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles to combat a predicted offensive by Cuban-backed troops. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, who holds the rank of brigadier general in the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, also urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to improve the monitoring of Cuban troop pullout from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> against any attempts by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to cheat. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said at a news conference that he was `` satisfied with the meetings'' he has had with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials about his organization's requests. But he also criticized parts of the U.S.-sponsored agreement signed last December that calls for the pullout of all Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and grants independence to neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from South African rule. `` There are flaws in the agreement that are not of our liking,'' he said. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to use `` sophisticated means'' to monitor the troop withdrawal, claiming that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had sent in fresh troops to replace some of the 3,000 who were pulled out under the agreement last month. He said there were no accurate figures for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops, who have been helping the Marxist Angolan government since it gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. Troop estimates from a variety of sources have ranged from between 50,000 and 60,000. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has promised to provide accurate figures by April 1, once the 90-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group is in place. The commander of the force, Brazilian Gen. <PERSON> Pericles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, says his 10-nation group will rely on Angolan and Cuban figures during the withdrawal. But <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said that could lead to cheating. He said the 27-month pullout timetable means <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops will remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> one year after Namibian independence, giving <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> a chance to send some of the troops to its ally <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Based on troop movements and weapon stockpiling, <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> predicted that Cuban-backed Angolan troops would launch two or three offensives against <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> between May and July, before the Aug. 1 deadline for the Cubans to move northward of the 15th parallel. He said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> needs long-range artillery pieces, anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already provides <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> with shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and TOW anti-tank missiles as part of a covert aid package estimated at $ 15 million annually. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> needs more arms because the Soviets recently delivered to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> 12 Cuban-flown MiG-25 fighter jets and some Mi-35 helicopter gunships. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, says <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> met with several people in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> but she declined to elaborate. `` We provide appropriate and adequate assistance to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said, but said policy bans discussion of covert aid. Much of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s arsenal, which is mostly of Soviet origin, was brought in through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African-controlled </LOCATION> territory. But this has stopped under terms of the tripartite agreement, along with the $ 80 million South African annual aid package, he said. In a separate interview, <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> had `` increased the capability of all airfields'' to accommodate long-range aircraft, indicating that these bases would be used to resupply the organization now that its land lines have been blocked. He also said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has a two-to-three year stock of military equipment it received through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and from three African countries which he declined to name. Despite reports to the contrary, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> enjoys `` moral and diplomatic support'' from about 15 other African states, he added. At the news conference, <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said he had asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to send a signal to several African nations, such as <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, of support for a dialogue between <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the Angolan government. Such a signal would spur these governments to put pressure on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to negotiate a cease-fire and power-sharing agreement with the rebels, he said. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> will not accept a government offer for clemency because `` we are not criminals,'' <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said, preferring to increase its military struggle to place additional pressure on the government to negotiate.

 Child care experts Thursday criticized President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed $ 1,000 child care tax credit as being too low and insufficient to address the range of problems faced by most parents. `` It's really irrelevant to the child care needs of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Child Development and Social Policy at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON>, speaking as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened a series of hearings on child care, called the proposal `` a non-solution.'' `` And the amount of money is too low. In an era where child care costs $ 3,000 and $ 4,000 a year, $ 1,000 does n't do much for that,'' said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON>, a professor of education at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. The committee estimates full-time child care costs at an average $ 3,000 annually per child. That means a family with two children, in which both parents work at minimum wage, spends more than half its income for child care. <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON>, a strong proponent of school-based day-care, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal does n't address the obstacles faced by single-working mothers or move to eliminate the `` two-tier'' care system he said is developing between low-income families and others who can afford private care. <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure to include a system of regulation in the proposal would result in poor families spending the money for other needs. `` The money in that proposal is not restricted to child care. Most of the funds in that proposal, if enacted, would not go for child care. They would go for food, housing, utilities, clothing and other necessities like that,'' said <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor of psychology, told the panel the proposal does n't address the quality of day care. She said quality should not be sacrificed because government policy frames it `` as a luxury issue in child care.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he will introduce a bill to expand existing child care tax credits for families with incomes under $ 25,000 and assist states in improving current programs. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s proposal would provide a maximum tax credit of $ 960 for one child and $ 1,920 for two or more children. The credit would be fully refundable and could be made available through payroll withholdings. Current law provides for tax savings of $ 720 for one child and $ 1,440 for two or more children and it is not refundable.

 It's been more than a year since the last State of the Union report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address to a joint session Thursday night was billed merely as a speech about his budget priorities. The Constitution requires that the president `` shall from time to time give to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> information of the State of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'' The last State of the Union address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was given by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Jan. 25, 1988. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said it was the last State of the Union address <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would make i person but that he would deliver a written report before leaving office in January 1989. As it turned out, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not prepare a written State of the Union report. Instead, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave what was called a farewell address from the Oval Office that was broadcast to the nation last month. Discussing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address, `` We do not consider this a State of the Union address because it's largely focused on the budget and not the State of the World affairs,'' said White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> disclaimer, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week adopted a resolution `` providing for a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to receive a message from the president on the State of the Union.'' Although there has not been an official State of the Union address in more than a year, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> noted there have been three major presidential addresses, including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural speech and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget address

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought another 600,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the wheat was part of an authorization of more than 2 million tons under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON> said the wheat is for shipment in March. Counting some left over from a previous <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement and 2 million tons authorized Jan. 25, the Soviets have more than 1.4 million tons still available under the program. With the latest sale, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought about 2.6 million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990. A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 600,000 tons are equal to about 22 million bushels worth around $ 90 million at recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm prices. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement lets private exporters sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 508,900 tons of grain sorghum. <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON> said the 600,000 tons of wheat were sold by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> a, 250,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 The companies will get subsidy of $ 23.01 per ton, or about 63 cents per bushel under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign has not yet filed federal reports covering more than $ 3.1 million in expenses incurred during the final month of last year's race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, aides to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said Thursday. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, a former campaign aide to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who now works in the governor's office, said expenses were not reported because the money went out in the form of vouchers that allowed staffers to withdraw cash, and the campaign's accountants were awaiting the documents needed to report what the money bought. Because of the pace of events in the closing weeks of the campaign, not all of the paperwork has made its way through, <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said. `` The events of the last month are not reflected,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. According to the report filed Feb. 2 at the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had more than $ 3.9 million on hand with nearly $ 1.3 million in unpaid debts, indicating that the campaign had a surplus of some $ 2.6 million. However, <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said the report did not include more than $ 3.1 million in vouchers that were paid but not listed because the supporting documents were not yet available. Figured with the money owed to the campaign and the cash on hand, the campaign should wind up within $ 3,500 of being broke, he said. The 1984 presidential campaign of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, was fined by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for failing to report expenses in a timely manner during that campaign, according to <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> records. An attorney for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Darr </PERSON>, said she would look into the current matter and `` we will correct it immediately'' if anything is wrong. `` We have been extremely careful all along,'' she said. Following an audit of the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> campaign, the election commission charged it with violating the law for failing to report $ 312,495 in expenses in a timely manner. Last year, the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> campaign agreed to pay a $ 30,000 fine, a relatively large sum to be levied by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, but that also included penalties for other related violations. Although the commission has told campaigns that using bank drafts is an acceptable practice, it has warned them against taking too long to report the expenses. `` Draft transactions are reported in the period in which the draft is paid by the bank,'' the commission said in a manual provided for presidential campaigns. Ms. <PERSON> Darr </PERSON> said she was not familiar with the commisison ruling in the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> case or the warning in the manual on bank drafts. `` Stuff like this is very technical,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A group of Arab Americans announced a campaign Thursday against a leading Jewish human rights group over a letter alleging that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> on college campuses are `` poisoning the minds of our young.'' The American <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accused B'nai B'rith International of sending `` hate literature'' to its members in a fund-raising letter designed to combat anti-Semitic propaganda and cult influence on Jewish college students. B'nai B'rith issued a statement questioning why the Arab organization was continuing its campaign `` after B'nai B'rith has publicly admitted that it was in error in using a phrase that may be considered offensive.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> ADC </ORGANIZATION> is apparently anxious to keep the matter alive and festering in order to score cheap points and damage the relationship between Jews and Arabs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the statement. The Jewish organization said that the letter, composed by an outside mailing house, was a mistake and that unmailed copies had been withdrawn two weeks ago. The organization has apologized privately to the Arab group but has rejected demands that it reveal how many such letters were sent, saying only that it was not a mass mailing. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, who serves as president of B'nai B'rith International and who was chosen last month as head of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations. The <LOCATION> American-Arab </LOCATION> committee has asked <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> to tell all the original recipients that he dissociates himself from the first letter, and B'nai B'rith spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said Thursday <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> had done so. <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>'s new letter says the views stated in the previous one `` do not reflect our views. The incident was an unfortunate mistake,'' <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> quoted the second letter as saying. Nonetheless, the Arab group has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to examine the tax exempt status of B'nai B'rith, which is based on the organization's description of itself as an educational institution, said committee spokesman <PERSON> Faris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouhafa </PERSON>. A similar request has gone to the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which grants such institutions preferred rates, he said. `` Every day we are subjected to a deluge of anti-Semitic propaganda'' on college campuses, the original letter said. `` This is a deliberate and well-organized campaign to undermine the basic beliefs and values of our young people _ our children and grandchildren,'' it said. `` The Arab presence on the college campus is poisoning the minds of our young people,'' the letter said. `` While cults and cultists are lurking around every corner, B'nai B'rith'' is `` there to battle against the very real threats to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bouhafa </PERSON> said his organization objects to the letter's association of Arabs with cultists and to `` the association of legitimate political activity on the part of Arab Americans with anti-Semitism.'' The committee has asked 575 civil rights and religious organizations to sign an open protest letter to <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>. `` For an organization known for its anti-discrimination efforts, it is dismaying to see discrimination against another ethnic group,'' said a letter to <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> from the Women's Division of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Hospital Limits Clergy Visits After Patients Complain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hospital has stopped telling clergy the religious backgrounds of new admissions after some patients complained they were startled to see priests or rabbis walk into their rooms. `` It frightens people when a priest walks in with a rosary,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipp </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscayne </ORGANIZATION>. `` They think they're dying and that we're holding something back.'' The policy, instigated three weeks ago, instructs administrators to release patients' names only if the patient approves beforehand. However, clergy who frequent the hospital complain that the new procedure makes it impossible for them to minister to the sick. Hospital officials and religious representatives discussed the policy at a special meeting Wednesday. Ms. <PERSON> Lipp </PERSON> said the hospital has stopped handing out a daily list that gives a rundown of every patient and his or her religious denomination because it may violate privacy laws and because of patients' complaints. The hospital also discovered that some of those soliciting lists were impostors more interested in the free lunch clergy receive at the hospital. Since the policy took effect, clergy have seen the number of calls they receive drop sharply, down to one or two a day. `` You do n't throw the baby out with the dirty water just because there have been a few complaints,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, director of chaplaincy for the Greater <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Jewish Federation. `` Visits by qualified clergy have always been regarded as something that assists the patient in his or her recovery,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Lipp </PERSON> said the real difficulty for the clergy is that only about 10 percent of the patients wish to have a visit. `` What they do n't understand and what they are not accepting is that most of these people do n't want to see them,'' she said. Many people go to church only once a year or not at all, she said, and do n't feel comfortable in the presence of clergy. `` You're sick You're not at your best. Maybe you're here for something very personal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lipp </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want to see some strange minister.'' But to assuage the clergy, the hospital agreed to emphasize the question during admissions and have patients sign a card accepting or rejecting religious visitors. Ministers at other hospitals, however, see the move as a bad trend. `` This sounds to me like an anti-religious move,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It certainly causes complications in ministering to the sick if you ca n't find them.''

<HEAD>Detainee's Hunger Strike Spreads, Lawyers Start Solidarity Fast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday it will not let a hunger strike by 300 black inmates change its policy of imprisonment without trial. The hunger strike is perhaps the strongest challenge to the policy of detention without trial since President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared a national state of emergency in June 1986. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report released in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> charged the government with `` state terrorism'' against the black majority. The 138-page report said that children continue to be victims of torture and other inhuman treatment. The report said news accounts of the problem are being distorted by censorship and other media restrictions as well as by official South African propaganda. <PERSON> Leliel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikuin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, who headed the group that drew up the report, told reporters Thursday that the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was getting `` worse and worse.'' In another development, two members of <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION>, a powerful Zulu political group, were sentenced Wednesday to hang for the murders of seven teen-agers in 1987, one of the worst incidents during a two-year power struggle in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Phewa </PERSON>, 31, were convicted and sentenced in <ORGANIZATION> Durban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The youths were forced into a minibus on March 16, 1987, taken to a cemetery, then beaten with hammers and stabbed, according to testimony. The killers allegedly suspected the youths were supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-apartheid coalition that has been feuding with Inkatha. Also Thursday, a bomb exploded in a moving police van, slightly injuring two white officers and a schoolboy walking nearby, police said. There was no claim of responsibility. More than 40 civil rights lawyers pledged to fast 48 hours until noon Saturday in support of the hunger strikers' demands to be freed or tried. The lawyers said seven detainees had been hospitalized after going 18 days without food. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> rejected a request by some of the lawyers to meet them Thursday at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Diepkloof Prison, where the strike began Jan. 23. He said the government `` can not allow itself to be blackmailed by way of hunger strikes.'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> indicated the government might reevaluate its stance `` if some of the hunger strikers near death. `` We will look at it again when we are standing at the crossroads,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. Civil rights workers said 105 detainees at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> in </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> _ many of them held since 1986 _ joined the hunger strike Monday. About 170 detainees at Diepkloof are fasting, as are detainees in the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Witbank </LOCATION>, a mining town near <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the lawyers said. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods during the state of emergency. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, at a news briefing Thursday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, said fewer than 1,000 people remain in detention. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said of the detainees, `` No one is being held without good reason.'' He said the government chose not to charge the detainees because of the difficulty obtaining convictions. The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, formed by anti-apartheid activists last year, said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> will be responsible `` should even one of the detainees die.'' Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 Badly designed fuel filler pipes on 5 million <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cars pose a fire danger that already has caused more than 200 deaths, a lawyer-founded group said Thursday. A <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company is not aware of any hazardous condition that would warrant a recall of older models. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference they want the company to spend $ 250 million to recall and fix the fuel tank assemblies on the cars, a variety of models made since 1965. Institute president <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the hazardous design has been the subject of several suits around the country, most ending in settlements. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerald </PERSON> <PERSON> terHorst </PERSON> said requiring automakers to modify older models to include each improvement in the product would mean that `` innovations and improvements would soon come to a halt.'' He said the company has confidence in the safety of its cars' fuel systems <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, an insitute member from <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said if <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> fails to act, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should step in to force a recall. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said he has been involved in nine cases involving fires in Ford-made cars, all ending in settlement. He said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has never acknowledged liability and has settled on the condition that amounts it paid not be disclosed. He said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged in court documents that 221 people have died in crashes involving fuel tank fires in Ford-made cars since 1965 and the institute believes from 50 to 100 more deaths have occurred with about 3,000 people injured. The defect, he said, is caused by a design that has the fuel tank filler pipe rigidly attached to the vehicles' fender, causing the hose to be pulled out in a rear-end collision. This causes gas and highly combustible vapors to escape and be easily ignited by sparks and heat generated in a crash, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. He said the danger can be avoided by lengthening the pipe, attaching it to the fuel tank and providing a `` breakaway'' device so it will detach from the outside panel, at a cost of about $ 50 per car. The institute said the systems was installed in full-size Fords, Mercurys and Lincolns built from 1965 to 1985; in some full-size 1986 Fords and Mercurys; in 1974-79 Lincoln Mark IV and Mark V models, and in some Thunderbirds, <ORGANIZATION> Cougars </ORGANIZATION>, Pintos, <ORGANIZATION> Bobcats </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION>, Capris, Fairmonts, <ORGANIZATION> Zephyrs </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Granadas </PERSON> built from 1970 to 1981. The institute, which describes itself as a non-profit research and educational organization concerned with reducing injuries resulting from product defects, estimated that 20 million cars were built with the fuel tank design and that 5 million of them are still on the road.

 Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> and more than 100 judges gathered Thursday to honor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noren </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge who killed himself after withdrawing his bid for a second term on the bench. <PERSON> Noren </PERSON> was eulogized as a renaissance man, a good judge and a considerate friend who spent his last hours writing thank-you notes to those who had supported him in his highly public battle for reappointment. <PERSON> Noren </PERSON>, 47, withdrew from consideration for a second eight-year term last week after appearing twice before the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which questioned him about his 1986 drunken driving arrest, his drinking habits and his truthfulness Three days later, he poisoned himself with car exhaust fumes in a barn near the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> farmhouse in rural northeast <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> where he had lived since his youth. A crowd of about 900, including more than 100 judges and scores of attorneys and court officials, applauded when <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaucher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a friend and attorney, began his eulogy by saying, `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Noren </PERSON> was a good judge.'' <PERSON> Noren </PERSON> had requested such a eulogy in his emotional second appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, saying, `` I have often said, not entirely facetiously, that I should like to have on my tombstone the epitaph, ` He was a good judge.''' The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> canceled sessions so judges could attend the service at a conference center, and most of the state's 139 <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges also cleared their schedules to attend. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> was as close to portraying the renaissance man as anyone I have known,'' said <PERSON> Noren </PERSON>'s college roommate, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. `` He was a historian, a raconteur, an antiques expert.'' <PERSON> Noren </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was clerk of <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION> from 1971 to 1980 before being named a judge. His first term would have expired Friday. There was a sentiment among many of those in attendance that <PERSON> Noren </PERSON>'s death reflected the amount of stress judges feel from the state's reappointment process, said Chief Court Administrator <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ment </PERSON>. `` What's happened is that we now have a procedure that is similar to trying to negotiate a minefield,'' said Ment. Some judges feel that `` the integrity of the system _ the independence of the judiciary _ is being eroded.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top terrorism expert said Thursday that officials were wrong to post notices of threats against American flights on embassy bulletin boards without also telling the traveling public. The posted notice relayed rumors of a threat against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights from <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and appeared days before a bomb exploded on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Dec. 21. All 259 people on board were killed. The threat was later determined to be a hoax. `` It is not our policy to alert government officials and not the general public to such a threat,'' <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is, and can be, no double standard.'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, appearing at the second congressional hearing of the day on efforts to tighten aviation security, called the threat to Frankfurt-U.S. flights a `` gruesome coincidence.'' The notice `` should not have been posted,'' he said. Officials have acknowledged that the warning was posted in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy and possibly other missions as well. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said officials at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy have said they found the policy on warnings `` not as clear as we thought it was.'' He said if a threat is specific and serious, authorities recommend cancellation of the flight. Otherwise, a public travel advisory is issued. Relatives of people killed in the unsolved explosion told the earlier hearing that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should speed federal efforts to tighten security against terrorist airplane attacks. Federal aviation and anti-terrorism officials defended the government's policy of not publicizing bomb threats against airlines, saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and airports receive an average of three threats a day. Relatives of those killed in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash said the government must do more in notifying passengers about terrorist threats and in installing sophisticated equipment to detect explosives and weapons. `` I bring no particular expertise to this committee other than possibly sadness, grief and tears,'' said a steady-voiced <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrell </PERSON>, an automobile dealer from <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, whose 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was among those killed in the crash. An additional 11 victims were killed in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, when flaming debris from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 plummeted to earth. `` When threats as specific as this are received, interested passengers must be notified,'' <PERSON> Berrell </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, Space and Technology's transportation subcommittee.

 A state grand jury has indicted two former <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials and a city employee on bribery charges in connection with casino linen contracts, authorities said Thursday. The indictment charges that former <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> planning board member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> misused his office in 1985 and 1986 by pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Sands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Casino to award a service contract to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linen </LOCATION>. Also charged is the firm's owner, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, former director of the city's housing authority. City employee <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former chauffeur for <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Usry </PERSON>, also was named in the alleged conspiracy. `` The grand jury alleged that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> pressured several hotel casinos for the linen contracts by peddling <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s influence with the <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to either expedite or delay pending proposals and applications by the hotel casinos for the establishment or expansion of parking facilities,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, director of the state Division of Criminal Justice. The indictments were returned Feb. 1 but remained sealed until Thursday. A second indictment charges <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspections </ORGANIZATION>, with bribery, official misconduct and conspiracy. Winter said the two men are charged with accepting a $ 250 bribe from an undercover detective in exchange for a promise they would expedite the approval of a city construction contractor license for the detective. The indictment says that when <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was negotiating for a linen service contract with <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s Claridge Casino Hotel, he told casino officials that if they wanted approval from the city board for expanded parking, `` We're going to have to be compensated.'' The indictment also charges <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> conspired to have his company bid for contracts as a minority owned firm, and then subcontract all work to non-minority companies. The indictment alleges that when <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> did not award the contract to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' company, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> warned, `` some people get put in plastic bags like that.'' The three men also are charged with attempting to pressure the Showboat Hotel Casino for its linen service contract. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> could not be reached for comment because they have unlisted telephone numbers. No number could be obtained for <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and there was no answer at <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' home. If convicted, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> face a maximum of 30 years in prison and fines of up to $ 300,000, and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> faces a maximum prison sentence of 60 years and $ 600,000 in fines.

<HEAD>Coordinator Of Nationwide Village Elections Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two gunmen killed the chief coordinator of next month's nationwide village elections in a late night ambush in front of the victim's home, police said Thursday. Sgt. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Disierto </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerochi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 54, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, was gunned down in his car Wednesday night after pulling up in front of his home in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The gunmen escaped. <PERSON> Gerochi </PERSON> was manager of the commission branch in charge of the March 28 election, when voters will choose 294,000 members of village councils across the country. Commission officials said they did not know the motive for the killing but said <PERSON> Gerochi </PERSON>'s house was strafed by unknown assailants during regional elections in January 1988. Police investigator <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said the assailants flagged down a taxi in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> about two hours before the killing and asked to be driven to the victim's home. They told the driver to keep his engine running and later asked and received water from the victim's maid to keep the motor cool while they waited for <PERSON> Gerochi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said. After eating dinner at a sidewalk cafe, they calmly returned to the house, shot <PERSON> Gerochi </PERSON> and then fled in the same taxi, he said. The driver, <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, told investigators he was forced at gunpoint to take the assailants back toward <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, where they disembarked and fled. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> then reported the shooting to police. <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said the driver told authorities that the gunmen spoke with an accent usually associated with Moslem areas of the south. The military had sought a postponement of the elections until May, saying they needed time to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels from disrupting the balloting. But President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> opted for the March date under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In another development, 50 Communist rebels raided a police station and robbed a bank in the small town of <LOCATION> Looc </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Bohol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, 380 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the military reported Thursday. The report said one government militiaman was killed in the Wednesday raid. The rebels made off with five rifles, four typewriters and about $ 11,000 in cash.

 Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> interceded to end a strike at <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest power complex Thursday and asked restive workers to give his negotiations with the government a chance. At a rally in a Roman Catholic church for employees of the huge Nova Huta steel mill, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spent more than an hour explaining the talks with communist authorities through which Solidarity hopes to become legal again. He urged workers to put aside local grievances long enough for the negotiations, which began Monday in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, to bear fruit. Strikes crippled the Nova Huta mill last spring and summer. A strike of coal miners at the Belchatow power complex 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, which supplies one-fifth of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s electricity, was ended with the help of a mediator sent by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, but other labor tension continued The <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said workers in the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> coke department were refusing overtime, and the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the same was true of ambulance staffs in <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> province, western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said about 460 workers at a machine plant near <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> started a strike Thursday for higher pay, cuts in administrative staff and better working conditions. Government delegates and representatives of the opposition met for seven hours Thursday in a working group on trade union issues and expressed optimism that technical details for restoring Solidarity's legal status could be worked out. Among major questions remaining are whether a `` social contract'' can be made on economic and political reforms, and the form of new parliamentary elections. Authorities have made agreement on those topics, being negotiated by other working groups, a condition for legalizing the union. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, national spokesman for Solidarity, told reporters the union wants a separate law making it legal again and expressed satisfaction with the prospects. `` It's not formal approval'' so far, `` but it's optimistic because the authorities asked for technical details,'' he said. `` So they treat -LRB- our position -RRB- as a serious thing and will consider it as such.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwasniewski </PERSON>, a government minister who took part in the meeting, said the discussion now revolves around how the legalization would occur. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> founded Solidarity in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he still works as a shipyard electrician, during the labor turmoil of 1980 and the government initially accepted it as the first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc. It was suppressed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981, however, and later outlawed. After attending the first part of Thursday's negotiations in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left for the evening Mass and rally in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He is making a two-day tour of the southern region to reassure skeptical workers about the negotiations with the government. Speaking to a crowd of about 3,000 people after Mass in the Mistrzejowice church, which was lined with Solidarity banners, he declared: `` I do n't believe in the government, but there is a possiblity for pluralism. As <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> I must do everything, or take every opportunity peacefully, to build a better <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The union leader, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, has apologized to audiences lately for `` too elegant'' by wearing a suit and tie to the negotiations. He appeared at the rally in a sportcoat and jeans. When members of the audience shouted out grievances against the steel mill management and behavior of local authorities, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared impatient. `` Each one of us has grievances and reasons to strike, and we have to get out of this,'' he said. `` If there is a chance at the round table, we have to take it.'' Solidarity can address specific problems when it is allowed to function legally, he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s initial appeal, in an interview with state radio, was broadcast as the working group on unions began its meeting. He called the Belchatow strike `` another proof that we should reach agreement on the most important things as soon as possible and restore the organization called Solidarity.'' Wildcat strikes could be avoided if an organized union spoke for the workers, he said, and told Solidarity's supporters: `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is appealing for a chance for the round table. We have been waiting for so many years, we can wait a few days more.'' The unprecedented talks, first proposed during severe labor unrest in August and expected to last up to six weeks, are intended to create a national consensus for solving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s severe economic, social and political problems.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that 10,000 extra visas will be issued in both 1990 and 1991 to immigrants from 162 countries on a random basis. Eligible for the lottery are citizens of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and several other countries whose refugee quotas are filled. The application period is March 1 through March 31. Unlike the last such lottery in 1986, the visas will not be issued on a first-come, first-serve basis. Instead, the applications will be fed to computers and the selections made on a random basis. Immigrants from all the eligible countries will have an equal chance. Unlike refugees, who are generally given haven for political reasons, immigrants are required to have close relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or have a scarce profession. However, the 20,000 to be admitted under the special program will not have to meet those requirements. Only screening for mental or criminal liabilities will be conducted, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The only countries excluded are those that used more than 5,000 immigrant slots in fiscal 1988. These are <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. The excluded include <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and also natives of <LOCATION> Anguilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Monteserrat, <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, Turks and <LOCATION> Caicos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. A lottery for 10,000 visas was held in 1986. About 1.4 million applicants lost out. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement contained strict rules for applicants. Among them is that all applications must be typewritten and that husbands and wives may apply separately. Last month, in a move to admit more Soviet and East European refugees, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided to increase this fiscal year's quota by 7,000 by lowering the quota of Vietnamese refugees, many of whom are former political prisoners. The decision brought to 25,000 the number of Soviets who will be permitted to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While the added slots will be taken mostly from the quota for refugees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials stressed the president has considerable flexibility to alter the totals later on. Thousands of Soviet refugees, many of them Jews, are in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, waiting for permission to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the quota for them to enter this country is full. The lottery announced Thursday will give them a chance to enter the country as immigrants _ but the chance will be no greater than that of applicants from the 161 other countries that are eligible.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday outlawed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most notorious neo-Nazi organization, and police discovered a small cache of weapons and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> propaganda in a search of the party headquarters. During coordinated raids across the country, police confiscated knives, guns, ammunition, posters of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and swastika-covered banners from members of the <PERSON> Nationale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammlung </PERSON>. `` The Federal Republic is not about to become the roaming grounds for right-wing extremists,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said in announcing the ban. The group's leader, neo-Nazi <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, said he was considering legal action to fight the ban. Founded last summer, the <PERSON> Nationale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammlung </PERSON> had fielded candidates for next month's elections in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and suburban <PERSON> Langen </PERSON> and said it hoped to run in other locations as well. Its platform included renaming a railway station after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. The ban forbids <PERSON> Nationale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammlung </PERSON> members from carrying out any activities as a group, including fielding candidates for an election, and it bans them from using the name publicly. It coincides with a growing concern in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of a possible resurgence of ultra-rightist tendencies. Late Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network quoted <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleicher </PERSON>, head of the Hesse state Office for the Protection of the Constitution, as alleging that cases of murder and bank robberies have been linked to neo-Nazi parties in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schleicher </PERSON> also estimated about 2,000 neo-Nazis are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although other officials have put the figure closer to 1,500. `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, they're coming,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> magazine said in a headline on this week's cover. Another headline sarcastically referred to the extremists as `` the nice Nazis from next door.'' A poll published Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said another extreme right-wing group, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, would win 11.5 percent of the vote nationwide if federal elections were held now. The Republicans, headed by a former Nazi Waffen SS soldier, captured 7.5 percent of the vote in last month's elections in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. That sends 11 party members to the local legislature and gives the Republicans two seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> beginning next year. Further to the right of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are the neo-Nazis, who are split into about 10 different groups. The most notorious is <PERSON> Nationale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammlung </PERSON>, which has about 170 members. The <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Nationale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammlung </PERSON> had expressed revolutionary and combative aims to change West German society. It also accused <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> and his followers of building up neo-Nazi groups nationwide. The organization supports expulsion from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of foreign workers and asylum seekers. <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> has also been active with right-wing extremists from several countries in planning celebrations for the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birth April 20. Contacted in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kuenhen </PERSON> said in an interview he would fight the ban in court. `` I see certain legal possibilities,'' said <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, who has served three prison terms for Nazi activities. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> showed police carrying knives, guns and a box filled with ammunition from <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> home, which serves as the party's headquarters. <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> was not home during the raid. The broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house, where <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so they would cause more severe injuries. <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Milde </PERSON>, the interior minister of the state of <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION>, said most of the raids were in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The other states where police staged raids included <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhine-Westphalia </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Searches there turned up an air rifle, two steel helmets, a gas mask, three pistols for firing blanks, and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> propaganda. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said authorities were seizing any property they could find that belonged to the NS group, whose initials are identical to the best-known German abbreviation for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been banned since <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was founded in 1949. Under West German law, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> may ban any organization it determines is spreading Nazi propaganda. Violations of the ban carry penalties of up to five years in prison. There have been calls for the ministry to ban another neo-Nazi group, the Free German Workers' Party, which the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION> says has about 500 members. The party is under investigation in connection with arson attacks on foreign workers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said they arrested two of deposed President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government ministers Thursday and caught the former central bank president trying to flee with a large amount of cash. No charges were specified, but the detentions appeared to be connected with alleged financial irregularities under Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who ruled for nearly 35 years and was overthrown last week. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is in exile in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, 75-year-old former head of the central bank, was arrested while trying cross the border to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and confined to a police hospital, the authorities reported. They said said he was carrying $ 20,000, many traveler's checks and 12,000 West German marks. Police also reported the detentions of <PERSON> Adan </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON>, former minister of public health, and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s education minister. Officials in the provisional government of Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a longtime associate of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> who ousted him Feb. 3, have been saying all week that officials of the former regime apparently enriched themselves with public funds. Central bank officials said Wednesday they would examine checks written by some `` government officials who are no longer government officials.'' With the dictator gone, exiles are returning from neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and such opposition politicians as <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> are interviewed on television. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who has called elections for May 1, is receiving dissident factions of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems like a dream to see <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> on television,'' said journalist <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cazenave </PERSON>. `` It seems like a fantasy to hear leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> were received by the president of the republic. All this has never happened in this country.'' Leaders of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Casabianca </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallorquin </PERSON>, were exiled in 1960. After they were allowed back in 1983, police agents on motorscooters followed them everywhere. Opposition leaders hardly ever appeared on television while <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was in power. The general's son <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> owned one of the two stations in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> and his good friend <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> owned the other. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> closed the largest newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color, in March 1984 and called publisher <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> `` an enemy of the government.'' Soon after the coup, <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> was featured in a story in the the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> paper. Critics say only the faces have changed and the system of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule under a military president remains the same. But <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has appointed a capable Cabinet, set an election date and made overtures to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> alienated. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Towell </PERSON> spent an hour Thursday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>, then told reporters: `` We've heard the words We hear the commitments. Now is the time to see how they implement them. `` We will be judging the quality of our relationship on the degree in which they move forward in all these areas.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his maiden policy initiative to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday proposed a $ 1.16 trillion `` common sense'' budget for fiscal 1990 that calls for less military but greater domestic spending than sought by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The plan, which features a one-year freeze on scores of federal programs, calls for roughly $ 5 billion more spending than the budget submitted by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month and carries out <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-stated opposition to new taxes. `` Higher taxes ... are not the solution to the deficit problem,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 193-page budget outline declares. But, while the measure supports many of the campaign vows made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his 1988 presidential campaign _ more help for the homeless, for education, for child care and for cleaning up the environment _ it also leaves much of the federal budget up to negotiation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Initial reaction from lawmakers was cordial. `` The Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to work with this president in every way that we can,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a taped response for the television networks. `` We'll give him our sincere cooperation. That does not mean obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` happy with the budget and eager to get on with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initiatives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first presidential speech, televised nationally at 9 p.m. EST, was expected to mix campaign promises with expressions of budget restraint and new overtures toward bipartisanship. But his budget was vague on exactly where all the money would come from to pay for initiatives. `` It is not as much as he promised but it is a start,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing The budget director said that there was room for even more savings in federal spending if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided to go along with the dozens of programs that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought to terminate _ actions that for the most part the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget does not embrace. The new budget did not detail which programs should be cut beyond the general proposal for a spending freeze. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is ready to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a final budget `` all day and all night if that's what it takes,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. His budget, described as a `` common-sense approach to budgeting,'' calls for a one-year freeze on defense spending at the levels of inflation. And, it projects a federal deficit in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 of $ 94.8 billion _ well within the $ 100 billion limit set by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. If the sale of government assets are included, the deficit would be even lower _ $ 91.1 billon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget amendments call for an overall budget surplus of $ 3.8 billion by 1993. The plan seeks to put in motion a variety of campaign promises, including a proposed $ 1,000-per child tax credit for low-income families, a $ 3,000 tax deduction to help cover the costs of adoptions, an expansion of the Head Start program and a new plan to give grants to the nation's best high schools. It would also provide nearly $ 1 billion more in the upcoming year to fight `` the scourge of drugs'' and would restore some $ 1.7 billion in cuts sought by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Medicaid program for medical assistance for poor people. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would also reduce to 15 percent from the current level of 28 percent to 33 percent the tax on most capital gains _ the profits from the sale of real estate, stocks or other assets. This proposal had drawn opposition in advance from congressional Democrats, who vowed to fight it as a tax benefiting mostly the rich. And there are other strains in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to extend an `` offered hand'' to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. His speech comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is engaged in a protracted and divisive confirmation struggle over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he stands firmly behind his nominee, despite recurring allegations of womanizing and excessive drinking that continue to stall the confirmation process. The budget plan presented few surprises. Most of its elements had been reported in the past. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s long-sought appeal for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and authority to veto individual lines in spending bills. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who promised a `` kinder but gentler nation'' in his campaign, also proposed an overall increase of 70 percent in federal spending on `` the tragedy of men, women, and children living without homes.'' Much of the revenues needed to fund <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new initiatives would come from spending freezes on a host of federal programs _ including all government military and civilian retirement benefits. However, Social Security benefits would not be affected under the plan. The president claims his capital gains proposal would generate $ 4 billion or so in revenue by stimulating new business investment, but many economists have disputed this and the proposal has already encountered stiff Demcoratic opposition. In fact, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday promised all-out opposition to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to reduce the capital gains tax Even so, Democratic leaders generally seemed ready to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the benefit of the doubt in his first speech to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think there's any particular effort on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to do anything expect to applaud what the president is about to say and to continue the kind of spirit that the president has been working very hard on ... in trying to develop a relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., Under regular procedures, the president's budget gets modified by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into a final budget resolution, which then serves as an overall guide for legislation produced later by the appropriations and tax-writing committees <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan modifies a $ 1.15 trillion budget <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted shortly before leaving office. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plan called for a 2 percent increase in defense spending over inflation, proposed scores of cuts in domestic programs and projected a federal deficit of $ 92.5 billion.

 Working together <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will pass a clean air bill this year to protect that precious commodity upon which all human life depends. A kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? That's old time Democratic religion. We embrace it enthusiastically! We know, and you know, that these goals can not be achieved by words alone, or by symbolic gestures. They require money _ the commitment of resources sufficient to win the battle against these common enemies. On the question of how these vital initiatives will be paid for, the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will insist on fairness. We would have to reject any kind of `` flexible freeze'' that would bend with flexibility for the rich and powerful but freeze out the middle income families of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We will oppose attempts to cut <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. We are ready to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> any time he wishes and seek common solutions. Our <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will begin its formal hearings in a very few days. The president's representatives are invited. We are determined to complete our work on time, and pass our appropriations bills on time, again this year _ as we did last year. We do have limited resources and urgent challenges. But there are some things we can do without spending public money. We must raise the minimum wage, held down for eight long years _ because those who work honestly for wages in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must never receive less than they would on welfare. We can ask that polluters pay more of the cost of cleaning up the poisons which they create and from which they profit. We must encourage <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations to reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ in plants and factories and jobs and strength, not in leveraged buyouts and paper profits. We should require that corporations insure the health of their employees _ so that the hard earned family savings of a decade or more can not be wiped out by the illness of a single child. When it comes to shaping a kinder, gentler, fairer nation the real question is not whether we have the words but whether we have the will. For ultimately we will be judged by what we have done. In the years ahead, long after this night is forgotten and the phrases have faded and our page of history has turned, let it be said of us that we have refreshed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sense of common concern; that we renewed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s basic strength; that together we reached out for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future and put our faith and our investment in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. In our earnest efforts to help the new president build this future, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will work together. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic majority is represented tonight by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ our recent nominee for vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ Senator <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.

 A shot of cold arctic air flowing across the Great Lakes created snow in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on Thursday and a low pressure system off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> swept rain through the valleys and snow on the mountains. Temperatures warmed over portions of the Plains and the South remained mild. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, snow fell over the northern mountains, the <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where a winter storm warning was in effect Thursday. Twelve inches of snow were dumped on <LOCATION> Olancha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Strong winds, gusting to nearly 60 mph overnight, were diminishing over the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Snow also fell over portions of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, some of it in areas that usually do not receive much snow. Four inches of new snow were recorded at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, cold arctic air moving across the lakes' warmer waters created lake-effect snow Snowfall over western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday morning included 5 to 6 inches at <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, and 5 inches at <LOCATION> Sodus </LOCATION>.

 A federal appeals court denied a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attempt Thursday to stop <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial on national-security grounds, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration vowed to continue trying to put the proceeding on hold. Possible airing of state secrets, as the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide defends himself, has threatened all along to scuttle the trial. Two major charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> were dropped last month for that reason. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said `` the risk to national security would be significant'' under current rules laid down by the trial judge. He said the government would lack control over `` disclosure of very sensitive, classified information.'' `` It would be a complete crapshoot,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. He said the government could seek reconsideration of the ruling by the appeals court or go directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, spoke with reporters after the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to block the trial's start. On Thursday night, the department said it will ask the three judges on the appeals court panel to reconsider its decision Friday morning. `` They had before them a lot more'' material from independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` than they had from us,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the department does n't have the authority to intervene in such a fashion and he opposes the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to block the trial. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also said the appeals court had before it the order from the North case trial judge, who earlier in the day rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request to stop the proceedings. By the time the appeals court acted, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had already sent the newly picked jury home for the weekend with instructions to return, ready for swearing in, at 9:30 a.m. Monday. The government's objections to the procedures adopted by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> must be heard before the trial begins because harmful disclosures `` could come as early as the opening statements,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. In a two-sentence order, the appeals court dissolved its temporary stay of the proceedings, saying it was denying the department's motion to stop the trial `` substantially for the reasons'' cited by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. The judge had ruled that the attorney general did not have authority to intervene in the prosecution, which is being handled by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. Two hours earlier, not having heard from the appeals court, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had sent the jury home, saying he had to `` close up shop'' until Monday because of the government appeal. `` What we are going to do is shut down, catch up on our sleep,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had appealed a <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruling that department officials could not routinely censor classified information before it was presented in court. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled that the attorney general's only authority to enter the case at this stage is to take the drastic step of affirming in an affidavit that disclosure of certain classified information would damage national security. Under that provision, the court would be required to order North not to make the disclosure. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said `` we think that's premature. We could file such an affidavit when there is specific information that's at issue.'' Earlier Thursday, the jury was selected, with lawyers from each side eliminating prospective jurors from a panel of 45 without stating a reason. All of the people on the panel had said in open court they had read, heard or seen little or nothing of North's testimony before two congressional committees in the summer of 1987 Nine of the 12 criminal charges lodged against <PERSON> North </PERSON> focus on accusations that he concealed from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> his efforts on behalf of the Contras fighting the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. North also is accused of illegally accepting installation of a security system at his home, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader, and conspiring to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the rebels. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would not swear in the jury until the appeals court ruled. The rule of double jeopardy, which protects North from being tried twice on the same charges, comes into play once a jury is sworn. The all-black jury is typical of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> community, which is heavily involved in federal government affairs and which is, racially, about 75 percent black. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in requesting Thursday's stay: `` Because of the national security equities involved and the highly sensitive classified information that may be compromised if this case is permitted to proceed to trial without correction of the procedures that the district court proposes to employ, it is imperative that the trial be suspended pending the outcome of the pending appeal.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> called the department's attempt at intervention `` frivolous.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the independent counsel who brought the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, told the appeals court that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no right to intervene _ that such authority rested with the independent counsel.

 A new president's first budget is always a collision between campaign rhetoric and reality, and the budget <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put forward Thursday could spell a quick end to his honeymoon with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the campaigner wanted to be the education president, stop the drug scourge, house the homeless and clean up the environment. And he promised that all the good things he wanted for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people could be accomplished without raising taxes. The critics charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would fail. Either the promises would go unfulfilled or the president would end up increasing taxes. But in a melody with a familiar refrain, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came up up with a way out of his quandary. He said he will raise more revenue by cutting taxes. Strains of `` That Old Black Magic'' by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The tax <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has in mind is the capital gains levy, which taxes the profits earned from the sale of assets, such as stocks. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget projects a $ 5 billion increase in revenues for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, through enactment of the cut in the capital gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains tax helps the new president achieve a projected 1990 deficit of $ 91.1 billion, slightly bettering the $ 92.5 billion deficit <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put forward one month ago in his final spending blueprint. That is accomplished through the $ 5 billion projected revenue gain from the cut in the capital gains tax and $ 2.6 billion in reductions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed making in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1990 military spending request. Currently the profits on sales of assets are counted just like other income, which means for high-income people a top tax rate of either 28 percent or 33 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to cut the capital gains rate in 1990 to 15 percent for assets held one year or longer and projects the change would increase revenues by $ 5 billion as people sold assets to take advantage of the lower rate. But that revenue estimate comes with a big catch, many economists believe. It will lower government revenues for other years. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, economic consulting firm, said that much of the revenue would be lost in the current year, thus ballooning the size of the 1989 deficit, which is already projected to soar to $ 161 billion. `` I guarantee that you would lose about the same amount of revenue in 1989 that you will gain in 1990,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. `` If you know that the capital gains rate is going down on Jan. 1, you wo n't be selling a lot of stock at a profit in June. Democrats on Capitol Hill have another complaint. They say the capital gains tax cut, which was one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promises, is nothing but the old <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> `` trickle down'' theory to benefit the rich. They contend that 85 percent of all capital gains are earned by the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans. They aimed their fire at the proposal in barbed remarks stripped of the bipartisan good feeling which surrounded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural address. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., said that at a time of huge budget deficits it was `` simply unacceptable to be considering tax breaks for the very wealthiest segment of the American population. The capital gains tax was n't the only target drawing fire. Critics complained that in many other areas the amount of money <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing to spend is minuscule when compared with the magnitude of the problem. Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s joint address, his aides were busy lowering expectations, contending that in a time of tight budgets it was tough to fund new initiatives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, told reporters at a briefing on the budget that the president had at least made a start toward fulfulling his pledge for a `` kinder, gentler'' nation. `` Is it as kind and gentle as everyone would like to be immediately, I think probably not. But we ca n't do absolutely everything at once,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told reporters. `` We will not be claiming to have solved all problems.'' During the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the deficit problem would simply melt by 1993 or 1994 if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would enact his `` flexible freeze,'' whereby the overall rise in government spending is held to the increase in inflation each year. Some programs could climb faster than the inflation rate but only if other areas were pruned back. But the pruning is likely to be as difficult for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as it was for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Thursday he was upset that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided to leave in his budget a proposal also in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final budget to curb <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending by $ 5 billion next year by trimming payments to doctors and hospitals. Such a cut, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` leads to very serious problems because you have a lot of hospitals losing money on Medicare now and a lot of hospitals closing, particularly rural hospitals.''

 Next year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in the law, the federal government will take in over $ 80 billion more than it does this year. That's right _ over $ 80 billion in new revenues, with no increase in taxes. Our job is to allocate those new resources wisely. We can afford to increase spending _ by a modest amount, but enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in one year. That will allow us to meet the targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation in federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending initiatives were designed to be immortal. I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night _ if that's what it takes _ to meet the budget targets, and to produce a budget on time. We can not settle for business as usual. Government by continuing resolution _ or government by crisis _ will not do. I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible. We could save time and improve efficiency by enacting two-year budgets. Forty-three governors have the line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too. At the very least, when a president proposes to rescind federal spending, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be required to vote on that proposal _ instead of killing it by inaction. And I ask for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to honor the public's wishes by passing a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Such an amendment, once phased in, will discipline both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch. Several principles describe the kind of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> I hope to build with your help in the years ahead. We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems _ because higher spending and higher taxes put economic growth at risk. Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth enables us to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the security of the nation. And low tax rates create economic growth. I believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice _ and I will work for choice for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families, whether in the housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their children, or the child care they select for their young. I believe that we have an obligation to those in need, but that government should not be the provider for first resort for things that the private sector can produce better. I believe in a society that is free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind. I will work to knock down the barriers left by past discrimination, and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again. I believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the nation _ and I will work to make them strong, for as <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said: `` If a sparrow can not fall to the ground without His notice, -LRB- can -RRB- a -LRB- great nation -RRB- rise without His aid?'' And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives better through growth and opportunity. Together, let's put power in the hands of people.

 Three weeks ago, we celebrated the Bicentennial Inaugural, the 200th anniversary of the first presidency. And if you look back, one thing is so striking about the way the founding fathers looked at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They did n't talk about themselves. They talked about posterity. They talked about the future. We, too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves. We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow. We must extend <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in technology, increase long-term investment, improve our educational system, and boost productivity. These are the keys to building a better future. Here are some of my recommendations: _ I propose almost $ 2.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to promote basic research; _ I propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development; _ I have asked Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to chair a new <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Competitiveness; _ I request funding for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and a strong space program _ an increase of almost $ 2.4 billion over the We must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle program; and more commercial development in space. The space program should always go `` full throttle up'' _ that's not just our ambition; it's our destiny. I propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase long-term investment. History is clear: this will increase revenues, help savings, and create new jobs. We wo n't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> behind. This is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise zones, and bring hope to our inner cities. But the most important competitiveness program of all is one which improves education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. When some of our students actually have trouble locating <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on a map of the world, it is time for us to map a new approach to education. We must reward excellence, and cut through bureaucracy. We must help those schools that need help most. We must give choice to parents, students, teachers, and principals. And we must hold all concerned accountable. In education, we can not tolerate mediocrity. I want to cut the drop-out rate, and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a more literate nation. Because what it really comes down to is this: the longer our graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will be tomorrow. So tonight I am proposing the following initiatives: _ The beginning of a $ 500 million program to reward <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best schools _ `` merit schools''; _ The creation of special presidential awards for the best teachers in every state _ because excellence should be rewarded; _ The establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; _ The expanded use of magnet schools which give families and students greater choice; _ And a new program to encourage `` alternative certification'' _ which will let talented people from all fields

 Supplies are so short in Veterans Administration hospitals that nurses are scrounging thee little souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to bring to <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> patients, a nurse told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. Supply accounts are frequently raided to pay salaries and avoid layoffs, an outside medical administrator told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Morissey </PERSON>, a nurse at the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, veterans hospital and prsident of the <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in testimony submitted to the hearing, `` At one VA hospital in the south, nurses were frustrated by the refusal of -LRB- the -RRB- prosthetics -LRB- department -RRB- to supply wheel chair cushions for patients on the long term care unit. `` The nurses obtained a $ 25 donation, went to the local upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress, and with an electric knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses, cut the foam to make wheel chair cushions for their patients.'' She did not identify the hospital, nor the hospital in other anecdotes: `` Nurses in one hospital brought in souvenir hotel soaps and shampoos for the patients, and in another, brought and cut large bars of soap in small pieces for patients to use.'' At her own hospital, she said, `` We can not properly monitor diabetic patients when there are no lancets to do finger sticks, no Chem Sticks for blood samples and no insulin syringes to use to give insulin if it is needed. This is the situation I have faced over the past month at my facility and I thank God there has been no crisis because of it.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he could not address allegations made at specific facilities in the VA system of 172 hospitals and more than 220 out-patient clinics. `` Where we have specific allegations, we would defer to the local hospital for comment,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` I would n't want to speak to the allegations of one nurse or one who represents a group of nurses as something that exists throughout the system.'' He said, however, that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> director-designate <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told the committee earlier this week that he would seek more money as a supplemental budget for 1989 and in the 1990 budget. `` He is aware of problems caused by the budget crunch,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` He met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> yesterday -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- and I am sure the problems of the hospitals were discussed.'' A Soviet report last week of hospital patients getting AIDS from unsterilized needles `` is a startling reminded to us in this country that mistakes can happen when the system starts to cut corners and workers perform daily under inordinate pressure as we do in the VA,'' she said. At congressional hearings last September, <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> officials said they faced a $ 600 million to $ 1 billion shortfall in their $ 10.54 billion budget for medical care in the current fiscal year. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, who will become secretary of veterans affairs when the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> becomes a cabinet department next month, said Tuesday he had met with Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Declining to say if he thought a supplemental appropriation is needed for the current fiscal year, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said the meeting with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> `` did n't result in any figure changes, but I hope it'll increase his sensitivity. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, vice president for medical affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a member of a <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and a consulting surgeon to two VA hospitals, said, `` By moving funds from other accounts, the Department of Medicine and Surgery was able to remain near the congressionally mandated 194,720 employment level,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>. Shine, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that next year's medical budget should be $ 12.42 billion, a 14 percent, or $ 1.48 billion, increase over this year's total, instead of the $ 186 million increase proposed in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget. Four veterans organizations have endorsed a similar amount for next year.

 I have said I'd like to be `` the education president.'' Tonight, I ask you to join me by becoming `` the education <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Just last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a letter from a mother in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, who had been struck by my message in the inaugural address. `` Not 12 hours before,'' she wrote, `` my husband and I received word that -LRB- our -RRB- son was addicted to cocaine. -LRB- He -RRB- had the world at his feet. Bright, gifted, personable ... he could have done anything with his life. -LRB- Now -RRB- he has chosen cocaine.'' `` Please,'' she wrote, `` find a way to curb the supply of cocaine. Get tough with the pushers. -LRB- Our son -RRB- needs your help.'' My friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of your own neighbor. Your own friend. Your own son. Over 23 million Americans used illegal drugs last year _ at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being. Let this be recorded as the time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> rose up and said `` No'' to drugs. The scourge of drugs must be stopped. I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs. The war will be waged on all fronts. Our new `` drug czar,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and I will be shoulder-to-shoulder leading the charge. Some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor, and to young mothers. This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent victims of drugs _ like the thousands of babies born addicted, or with AIDS, because of the mother's addiction. Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment. Some money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is now the worst. And much of it will be used to protect our borders, with help from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the departments of State and Justice, and yes, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. I mean to get tough on the drug criminals. Let me be clear: this president will back up those who put their lives on the line every day _ our local police officers. My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences _ and for the worst kingpins, that means the death penalty. I also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted, there is a cell waiting for him. He should not go free because prisons are too full. Let the word go out: if you are caught and convicted, you will do time. But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop demand for drugs. So some of this increase will be used to educate the young about the dangers of drugs. We must involve parents. We must involve teachers. We must involve communities. And my friends, we must involve ourselves. One problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and our continuing compassion. That is the terrible tragedy of AIDS. I am asking for $ 1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease _ and for research to find a cure.

 If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the environment. We must protect the air we breathe. I will send to you shortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act. It will include a plan to reduce, by date certain, the emissions which cause acid rain _ because the time for study alone has passed, and the time for action is now. We must make use of clean coal. My budget contains full funding, on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement we have made with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. We intend to honor that agreement. We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund new acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund. We must protect our oceans. I support new penalties against those who would dump medical waste and other trash in the oceans. The age of the needle on the beach must end. In some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. When those with the most promise can be tapped safely, as with much of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, we should proceed. But we must use caution and we must respect the environment. So tonight I am calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions _ two off the coast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and one which could threaten the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Action on these three lease sales will await the conclusions of a special task force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage. I am directing the attorney general and the administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic waste dumpers. I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties against polluters. In addition to caring for our future, we must care for those around us. A decent society shows compassion for the young, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor. Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable _ infants, poor mothers, children living in poverty _ and my proposed budget recognizes this. I ask for full funding of Medicaid _ an increase of over $ 3 billion _ and an expansion of the program to include coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line. I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of child care. Our help should be aimed at those who need it most _ low-income families with young children. I support a new child care tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families _ without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home. Now, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: The overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors, churches and community groups. Families who choose these options should remain eligible for help. Parents should have choice. And for those children who are unwanted or abused, or whose parents are deceased, I believe we should encourage adoption. I propose to re-enact the tax deduction for adoption expenses, and to double it to $ 3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents who love them. We have a moral contract with our senior citizens. In this budget, Social Security is fully funded, including a full cost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract.

 We must care about those in `` the shadows of life,'' and I, like many Americans, am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless. The causes of homelessness are many, the history is long, but the moral imperative to act is clear. Thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land, many organizations already contribute. But we in government can not stand on the sidelines. In my budget, I ask for greater support for emergency food and shelter, for health services and measures to prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill _ and I propose a new initiative involving the full range of government agencies. We must confront this national shame. There is another issue I decided to mention here tonight. I have long believed that the people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> should have the right to determine their own political future. Personally, I favor statehood. But I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take the necessary steps to let the people decide in a referendum. Certain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices, threaten the health and security of our people. Left unattended, they will only get worse _ but we can act now to put them behind us. Earlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our savings system. I ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact our reform proposals within 45 days. We must not let this situation fester. Certainly, the savings of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must remain secure _ insured depositors will continue to be fully protected. But any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform. Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring. The best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again. The majority of thrifts in communities across this nation have been honest; they have played a major role in helping families achieve the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of home ownership. But make no mistake: Those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out of the business; and they should go to jail. We face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades of environmental neglect at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons plants. Clearly, we must modernize these plants and operate them safely. That is not at issue _ our national security depends on it. But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess that's been left behind _ and I propose in this budget to more than double our current effort to do so. This will allow us to identify the exact nature of the various problems so we can clean them up _ and clean them up we will. We have been fortunate during these past eight years. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a stronger nation today than it was in 1980. Morale in our armed forces is restored. Our resolve has been shown. Our readiness has been improved. And we are at peace. There can no longer be any doubt that peace has been made more secure through strength. When <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is stronger, the world is safer. Most people do n't realize, that after the successful restoration of our strength, the Pentaon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last four years. We can not tolerate further reductions. In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a one-year freeze in the military budget _ something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan. This freeze will apply for only one year _ after that increases above inflation will be required. I will not sacrifice American preparedness; and I will not compromise American strength.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for $2 Billion Cuts in Farm Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on lawmakers Thursday night to `` reform'' farm payment programs by reducing them by $ 2 billion next fiscal year, and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairmen of both agriculture committees quickly said he was cutting too hard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s overall fiscal blueprint for <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> programs appeared similar to what an outgoing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed a month ago, but some lawmakers expressed puzzlement over the fine print. Rep. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Neb., said the spending assumptions on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> based his outline were at sharp odds with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s and that `` we will have much negotiating to do with the administration. She said farmers facing more drought could not take deeper cuts. `` Ultimately, Mother Nature and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have the last word,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also had proposed $ 2 billion in cuts in payments by the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> next year. But he sought to soften the blow for farmers by making $ 900 million of those payments this fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> provides income-support payments to cotton, rice, wheat and feed grains producers as well as price-support loans that guard farmers against market slumps by making the government the buyer of last resort. Farm payments ballooned to more than $ 26 billion in 1986 but currently are costing taxpayers less than half of that as the farm economy continues to rebound from its doldrums of the early and mid-1980s. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget book said that `` provisions of current law were designed during the height of the farm crisis.'' `` It is now time to reform our farm programs and not wait until the current farm bill expires nearly two years hence,'' it said. It added that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called on Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to `` work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to develop a specific set of initiatives designed to reduce federal farm expenditures by $ 2 billion in 1990.'' It reviewed an array of possible means of cutting the expenditures, ranging from a speeded up lowering of target prices used to calculate income-support payments to reducing the number of acres eligible for payments. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. E. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kika </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement, saying he would `` make every effort possible to work harmoniously with my fellow Texan, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` However, as it is currently proposed, the administration's 1990 budget still makes unreasonable demands upon agriculture which has already given $ 30 billion in cuts from proposed budgets over the last eight years.'' `` We in agriculture are prepared to make a fair contribution, but this administration is asking us to take cuts which represent considerably more than our fair share of the budget-balancing burden,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` I would remind everyone that if we cut out the entire amount proposed for agricultural spending, it would still make only an almost infinitesimal impact on the total budget situation,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said the farm cuts envisioned would be double the automatic cuts prescribed if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to reduce the deficit under the Gramm-Rudman Act `` An agricultural budget cutting twice as deep as the Gramm-Rudman sequester is not a kinder and gentler budget,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` When the 1990 reagan budget was released, I expressed my hope that it was designed to make the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget kinder and gentler,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` I also expressed my fear that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> farm cuts would undermine a tough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating position in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks,'' he said. `` I am very disappointed that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget is neither kinder to the farmer nor tougher on our competitors in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> negotiations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which governs much of global commerce. Talks on updating the agreement have been going on for the last two years.

 I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming year: _ The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I have spoken about tonight; _ This defense freeze must be part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meets the targets spelled out in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes, and which incorporates reforms in the budget I have directed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to review our national security and defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies. I am also charging the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> with the task of developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and management of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ one which will fully implement the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> report. Many of the changes can only be made with the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ so I ask for your help. We need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We need multiyear procurement and two-year budgeting. And frankly, we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy. Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address tonight. We meet at a time of extraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful political and intellectual force around the globe. Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It is a time of great change in the world _ and especially in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full meaning of the change going on there, review our policies carefully, and proceed with caution. But I have personally assured General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that, at the conclusion of such a review, we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss any opportunity to work for peace. The fundamental fact remains that the Soviets retain a very powerful military machine, in the service of objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours. So let us take the new openness seriously. Let us step forward to negotiate. But let us also be realistic. And let us always be strong. There are some pressing issues we must address: I will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread and even use of sophisticated weaponry threatens global stability as never before. Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, never to be used again. This wo n't be easy. Verification will be difficult. But civilization and human decency demand that we try. And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. I will work to strengthen the hand of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And, around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best friend. We must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ including in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. For when people are given the chance, they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of worship, and certifiably free and fair elections.

 We must strengthen the alliance of industrial democracies _ as solid a force for peace as the world has ever known. This is an alliance forged by the power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our differences. So let us lift our sights _ to rise above fighting about beef hormones to building a better future, to move from protectionism to progress. I have asked the secretary of state to visit <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next week and to consult with them on the wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together _ including <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations. And I look forward to meeting with our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners in the near future. I, too, shall begin a trip shortly _ to the far reaches of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, where the winds of democracy are creating new hope, and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force. When I served as our representative in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> just 14 years ago, few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed since then. But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by something I came across from a Chinese writer. He was speaking of his country, decades ago _ but his words speak to each of us, in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, tonight. `` Today,'' he said, `` we are afraid of the simple words like goodness and mercy and kindness.'' My friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover those words. In just three days, we mark the birthday of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> _ the man who saved our union, and gave new meaning to the word opportunity. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> once said: `` I hold that while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating -LRB- that of -RRB- mankind.'' It is this broader mission to which I call all Americans. Because the definition of a successful life must include serving others. To the young people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, who sometimes feel left out _ I ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program called `` YES,'' for <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To those men and women in business _ remember the ultimate end of your work _ to make a better product, to create better lives. I ask you to plan for the longer-term and avoid the temptation of quick and easy paper profits. To the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ thank you. Your calling is a high one _ to be the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty. And I want you to know that the nation is grateful for your service. To the farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we appreciate the bounty you provide. We will work with you to open foreign markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agricultural products. To the parents of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I ask you to get involved in your child's schooling. Check on their homework. Go to the school, meet the teachers, care about what is happening there. It is not only your child's future on the line, it is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s. To kids in our cities _ do n't give up hope. Say no to drugs. Stay in school. And yes, `` Keep hope alive.'' To those 37 million Americans with some form of disability _ you belong in the economic mainstream. We need your talents in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s work force Disabled Americans must become full partners in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s opportunity society.

 The yacht Thursday's Child has been slowed by poor winds in its quest to break a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-to-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> speed record that has stood for 135 years, the sloop's ground support said Thursday. `` It would be miraculous if they made it by Friday,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lush </PERSON>, from the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where Thursday's Child will berth after reaching the finish line marked by the Golden Gate bridge. The racer reported by radio at midday Thursday it was 300 miles south of the Golden Gate, making only 6 knots in unfavorable winds, she said. The 60-foot, 10-ton state-of-the-art racing sloop entered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> waters before dawn. If it made the Golden Gate by Friday, Thursday's Child would crack the 1854 mark set by the clipper Flying Cloud by 10 days. But the support group estimated that at the current rate, the arrival probably would be on Saturday. The three-member crew, who left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Nov. 23, closed in on the world's oldest existing speed record, duplicating a 14,500-mile passage around fearsome <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> at the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The legendary three-masted Flying Cloud made the journey in 89 days, 8 hours. After hitting gale-force winds up to 40 knots earlier in the day, Thursday's Child apparently hit shifting winds to the north, forcing it into a time consuming tacking drill across the wind in order to continue north, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, part of the boat's ground support. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said the three crewmen were all well. They are skipper <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON>, 32; owner and master <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 54, who helped design the vessel, which features the latest in push-button satellite navigation equipment. Earlier this week <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON> called the adventure `` some of the finest sailing I ever had. I would do it again at the drop of a hat.'' Even if Thursday's Child succeeds in breaking the record, the vessel's mark may be vanquished before it can even be written in the history books. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said three other boats are now at sea trying to better Thursday Child's time. The merchantman Flying Cloud, with its 17-story masts that could carry 35 sails, was the marvel of its day. It was reputed the fastest of thousands of sailing vessels that raced each other across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, often with perishable cargoes.

 To the families of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> watching tonight in your living rooms: Hold fast to your dreams, because ultimately <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future rests in your hands. And to my friends in this chamber, I ask for your cooperation to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> growing while cutting the deficit. That is only fair to those who now have no vote _ the generations to come. Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not a time to rest, but a time to push forward. A time to invest in the future. And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit. I believe this. I would not have asked to be your president if I did n't. Tomorrow, the debate on the plan I have put forward begins. I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come forward with your proposals, if they are different. Let us not question each other's motives. Let us debate. Let us negotiate. But let us solve the problem. Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches _ but tonight is one of some note. On Feb. 9, 1941, just 48 years ago tonight, Sir <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> took to the airwaves during <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s hour of peril He had received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter quoting <PERSON> Longfellow </PERSON>'s famous poem: `` Sail on, Oh Ship of State! Sail on, Oh Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, with all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on my fate!'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war, but he directed his words to <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. `` We shall not fail or falter,'' he said. `` We shall not weaken or tire. Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.'' Tonight, almost a half-century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great. Now, as then, there are those who say it ca n't be done. There are voices who say that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best days have past. That we are bound by constraints, threatened by problems, surrounded by troubles which limit our ability to hope. Well, tonight I remain full of hope. We Americans have only begun on our mission of goodness and greatness. And to those timid souls, I repeat the plea _ give us the tools; and we will do the job.

<HEAD>Iran's Leaders Say Seeking Gulf War Victory Was Mistake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Iranian leaders said they may have made a mistake by trying to win a military victory over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s intervention in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> was a setback that may have decided the war. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and Chief Justice <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON> also said in interviews with the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that the Islamic revolution is still a long way from reaching its objectives. The interviews, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> in recent days, came as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution with the leadership divided over what direction <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should go. The comments on the war and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strategic failures were the first by senior figures to shed light on the inner workings of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s military planning and its eventual decision to accept last year's cease-fire in the 8-year-old gulf war. Ardebili noted that the naval intervention in the gulf by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> navies to protect shipping from Iranian attack was a severe jolt for <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` We saw that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was prepared to send its navy into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and pull the world along with it,'' he said. `` We had not taken that into account.'' He noted: `` I am among those who believe that the war should have been stopped after the liberation of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>.'' The Iraqis were driven out of that southern Iranian port city on the <LOCATION> Shatt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway in 1982, nearly two years after they invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following border skirmishes. The Iranian news agency did not say whether <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON> indicated he had opposed <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, whose objective was to defeat <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and topple President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, in 1982 or sought to convince him to end the war after the Iraqis were driven back across the border. The news agency quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s aim of military victory: `` We took too big a bite. `` Yes, we wanted something, but were not able to get it, and that was military victory. If we had moved with a bit more planning maybe it would not have been so far off.'' <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution last year after the Iranian leadership `` had done some calculations on our capabilities'' after a series of Iraqi offensives that left Iranian forces in disarray. The news agency reported few comments by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on the conduct of the war. But when asked whether the revolution had achieved its goals, he was quoted as saying: `` It's true we have not reached our destination and we might not even be halfway there. `` But we have started to move in the right direction and this is very important. So the revolution can by no means be branded a failure.''

<HEAD>Former Minister Leaves Grilling Without Egg on Her Face</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former junior health minister <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> emerged smiling Wednesday from a grilling by fellow lawmakers over her remark that most British egg production was affected by food poisoning bacteria. `` She stonewalled every question and acted like a grande dame,'' said lawmaker <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Winterton </PERSON>, a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, after the session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Agriculture. For nearly eight weeks Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> resisted the committee's summons to appear before it to explain her remark which outraged poultry farmers and led to tons of unsold eggs In an off-the-cuff remark in a brief TV interview she said: `` Most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now infected with salmonella.'' Her notorious words came during a scare over dangers from eating eggs, when one possible cause of infection mentioned was bad feed given to chickens. As farmers filed lawsuits against the government seeking compensation, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> to resign nine days before Christmas. Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> told the committee she had n't meant that most eggs were affected by salmonella bacteria, as one committee member suggested. She said that was a misrepresentation by the media. Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> said she still believed that a significant number of birds in a significant number of laying flocks were infected. So many eggs were eaten every day that even if only a small proportion of them were affected by the bacteria, they amounted to a very large number, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, 42, showed up before the bipartisan committee after it threatened to force a House of Commons motion compelling her to appear. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said this procedure was last used 350 years ago. The government is paying out nearly nearly $ 7 million in compensation for 108 million eggs destroyed and some 450,000 slaughtered chickens. It also launched an $ 865,000 advertising campaign to reassure people they could eat eggs without fear _ although it was best to hard-boil them for little children, the elderly and the sick.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tonight unveils a budget plan keyed to his campaign promises of `` kinder and gentler'' programs without new taxes, but it leaves difficult decisions on reducing the federal deficit for later. The president, in a 9 p.m. EST speech before a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will call for a nation more competitive abroad and more compassionate at home. To those ends, he will propose more federal spending in fiscal 1990 for clean air and clean coal technology, for science and space, for AIDS research and aid to the homeless, education and child care, according to administration and congressional sources. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims that those costs will be offset by about $ 4 billion in new revenue from a controversial cut in the capital gains tax _ another campaign promise _ and $ 2 billion by holding the expansion of the military budget to the rate of inflation.

 Twenty years ago, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> had trouble getting served in restaurants. Fire regulations were cited by proprietors to keep him out of movie theaters and nightclubs. On trains, he rode in the baggage or mail car without light, heating or access to a restroom. Things are n't that bad these days for <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, a 39-year-old polio victim who has been using a wheelchair since childhood. But welfare groups say many disabled people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are faced with poor facilities, unemployment, poverty and public indifference. `` There has been a transformation,'' <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said in an interview. `` That's not to say there's not a lot more to do.'' He recalls going into a cafe in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the late 1960s and being told by the manageress, `` We do n't serve wheelchairs.'' `` I told her the wheelchair was n't hungry.'' Nowadays, he said, restaurants automatically remove a chair at a table to make room for his wheelchair; movie theaters and nightclub workers carry him upstairs if necessary; <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>, given one or two days' notice, will provide a space in a first-class compartment for a second-class ticket. But branch-line trains, or locals, with non-sliding doors still relegate wheelchair users to the car or compartment at the end of a train that is used by crewman known as the train guard. All public buildings built since 1987 must be wheelchair-accessible. But many existing offices, hotels, shops, restaurants, pubs and theaters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, like other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities, have steps and lack suitable elevators and toilets. `` I think a lot of people are in the margin. ... I do n't think disabled people yet are treated as totally equal citizens,'' said <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, an assistant director in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION>, a national umbrella body for 440 disability groups. Critics say the government does not adequately cover the extra costs of being disabled, leaving many caught in what opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> called `` a poverty trap.'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, who is deaf, said in an interview: `` Because many of them are poor, they clearly are n't able to integrate into society as much as they ought to be able to and we want better financial provision for them. `` Poverty is something which is almost part and parcel of disability.'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> All-Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disablement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Disabled rights groups want a tax-free national disability income of $ 70 to $ 225 a week. A 1985-88 government survey found that 6.2 million adults in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, or one in nine, have at least one disability that significantly impairs their activity. Almost 70 percent are over 60. The report said disabled people under 65 earned an average net income of $ 171 a week, compared with $ 238 among the general population. Most disabled people live on state aid, it said. The Conservative government said it spent $ 12 billion last year on disability benefits, 90 percent more in real terms than in 1979 when Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> took power. But critics charge the government is cutting back, slowing down funds for remodeling private houses and preventing disabled people from moving out of state institutions. `` There is a constant battle making sure what has been won will not be lost,'' <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said. Disability groups estimate that about two-thirds of disabled people available for work are unemployed. The law obliges companies to hire a quota of disabled people, but statistics indicate that only 27 percent comply. The 1944 law says `` it is not an offense to be below quota'' unless an employer rejects a suitable disabled person. `` In certain cases, there are not enough disabled people to fit those jobs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. `` Any firm can ask for exemption and it is almost always granted.'' The government said it is committed to integrating disabled children into mainstream schools, and pays 554,000 adults $ 40 a week in `` mobility allowance,'' enabling many to buy cars. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Flynn </PERSON>, 52, a stroke victim who also uses a wheelchair, said she has to get by on a weekly income of $ 165. `` I think we're put on the scrapheap,'' she said. `` It can be difficult at times. I have to go without.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> provides free wheelchairs, artificial limbs and hearing aids. Specially adapted buses operate between major railroad stations and to airports, and two <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> sightseeing buses have recently been fitted with elevators. By the year 2000, all taxis must have access for wheelchair users. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s subways and buses are largely inaccessible to wheelchair users, and some sports stadiums lack parking for the handicapped. The handicapped, however, are allowed to park in no-parking areas for up to two hours.

<HEAD>Abortion Law under Attack in Italy as More Doctors Object</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years after <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> legalized abortion, the law is under attack by those who maintain it is too loose and has failed to stop `` back alley'' abortions. After bitter debate and street protests by pro-and-con forces, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved the Socialist-designed abortion law in May 1978 over the objections of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Three years later, the anti-abortion <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, led by a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> politician, tried to overturn the law by a popular referendum, but lost 67.3 percent to 32.7. Now the Movement for Life and other anti-abortion forces close to the church are clamoring for changes that would drastically restrict the cases in which abortion is permitted. `` They do n't want a referendum now,'' says <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Laratta </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, roughly the equivalent of Planned Parenthood. `` But in a couple of years, there will be the climate for it.'' <PERSON> Laratta </PERSON> was referring to the increased political clout of such conservative groups as Communion and Liberation. The group, founded by a Milanese priest as a foil to leftist groups, enjoys considerable support from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant political party. A telephone survey by Panorama, a leading newsweekly, found that 51.6 percent of those polled thought the law was just, while 47.5 percent did not and 0.9 percent did n't know. Of those who considered themselves `` practicing'' Catholics, 59.3 percent said the law was not just and only 39.2 said it was just; 1.4 percent of them did n't know Among the champions for restrictions on the current law is Health Minister <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Donat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattin </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat. Even some of the law's original supporters say the time has come to correct what many see as abuses that both widen loopholes for midterm abortions and make it difficult for a women to obtain a legal one. The law requires public hospitals and those that accept patients paid for by the government to have doctors available to perform abortions. It forbids private clinics from doing them. In a major concession to anti-abortion forces, it allows doctors, nurses and orderlies at public hospitals who object to abortion to be excused from performing them or assisting in them. Both sides agree doctors have abused the clause to further their careers. The critics say some doctors invoke the clause in order to devote more time to practicing other procedures and gaining experience that could lead to a better-paid post at a private clinic. Estimates put the percentage of objecting doctors at 60 percent to 70 percent. Some public hospitals in the south, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s poorest and most conservative region, were forced to stop performing abortions because all of their doctors became objectors. The result is that many women either must put up with long waiting periods or go to private clinics and pay as much as $ 730 for an illegal abortion. Others turn to `` mammane,'' women who perform abortions secretly in their homes, often in unsanitary conditions or with crude instruments that harm the woman. Eliminating clandestine abortions was the aim of the law. In 1986, an estimated 125,000 illegal abortions were performed in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, compared to 196,490 legal procedures. The 1978 law permits abortions in the 13th through 20th week of pregnancy only if the mother's health is jeopardized or the fetus has deformities. But anti-abortion forces charge that the restriction is frequently ignored. Communion and Liberation has called for the establishment of ethics committees in public hospitals to decide whether to approve midterm abortions. The debate over abortion exploded when Health Minister <PERSON> Cattin </PERSON> ordered the seizure of patients' records at a <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> hospital where two `` objector'' doctors claimed a woman had been allowed to abort in her fifth month for a fetal deformity they judged not very serious. <PERSON> Cattin </PERSON>'s actions sparked cries of violation of patients' rights of privacy and calls by the communists for his resignation. <LOCATION> Laratta </LOCATION> and others who want to keep the abortion law say the state must do more to promote contraceptive use. Some 2 million abortions have been performed legally in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, now a country of 56 million people, since the law was passed, and the number of abortions has been slowly decreasing in the past few years. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> did not approve use of government health insurance for payment of birth control bills, intrauterine devices -LRB- IUDs -RRB- and diaphrams until 1981. Birth control use in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is low but on the rise. <PERSON> Laratta </PERSON> says in 1984, only 3.3 percent of women in <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION>, in the deep south, used `` secure'' methods such as the pill or an IUD, while the figure for the industrial north was about 10 percent to 11 percent. Latest figures put the use of these methods in the south at about 12 percent and overall <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at less than 20 percent.

<HEAD>New Centers Sprouting in Japan as Tokyo Fills to Its Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSAKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Japanese are beginning to look away from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as the nation's power center and toward places like <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Kumamoto </LOCATION> in the far-off south for new development and economic influence. The new thrust: <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not just <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. For many Japanese now crammed into the capital city, it could mean a return to their roots in the countryside for good jobs and less stressful living. Here in the heart of this industrial city a dozen new skycrapers tower over the <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, a 400-year-old landmark, casting their shadow on a serene historic site but at the same time looming as a new symbol of decentralization in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The complex, called <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> Business Park, is one of dozens of large-scale development projects launched by local business groups in a campaign to reverse the flow of economic power to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Not only mighty regional centers like <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> but smaller and more remote towns also have begun their own development projects that are luring high-tech industry and beckoning their talented offspring home from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. One such place is <LOCATION> Kumamoto </LOCATION>, 560 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, about as far away from the capital as you can get without leaving <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> proper. It is the first of 26 locations designated as a `` technopolis'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internatinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. The model city there already has research facilities and is to be expanded to encompass two cities, 12 towns and two villages and cover nearly 40 square miles. It's tranquil, `` affluent and easy-going'' says <PERSON> Morihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosokawa </PERSON>, the local governor. It also has an abundance of flat, cheap land. The area already has persuaded major corporations like <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> to set up branch offices. It is also the home of <ORGANIZATION> Kyushu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be the world's largest producer of integrated circuits. For decades, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has been at the pinnacle of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s highly centralized society, drawing much of the best the nation had to offer. But as its concentration of political power and its growing role as a world financial center stretch its physical and spiritual limits, more Japanese are beginning to think the capital's dominance should be reduced. Planners also warn that another earthquake in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> like the one that killed 143,000 people in 1923 could devastate the country's centralized infrastructure and severely damage both the Japanese and world economies <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s business and industrial center before World War II, is in the western <LOCATION> Kansai </LOCATION> region about 250 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Community and business leaders there have begun a massive development program for the region of more than 13.5 million people. The project calls for the building of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first 24-hour international airport, a <ORGANIZATION> Kansai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> for students, researchers and their families, and the <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and Pacific Trade Center, planned with the hope of displacing <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> as a major distribution center for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> once the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. By the year 2000, direct investment in the projects will total at least $ 122 billion, analysts say, with indirect investment possibly doubling that figure. During <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar rush to reindustrialize, few questioned <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s dominance. With the best schools, jobs and entertainment, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> drew millions who dreamed of better lives as well as hundreds of companies wanting to be near government agencies, banks, financial markets and up-to-date information. As a result, more power has become concentrated in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> than in almost any other single city in the world. Thirty million people live in the greater <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> metropolitan area _ a quarter of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s population crowded into 2 percent of its area _ triggering the highest land prices in the world; choice commerical real estate was selling for $ 6.7 billion an acre last year. For those unable to afford to live in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> itself, commuting to work can take more than four hours a day. While <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s attraction still has n't faded, people in rural areas and cities like <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> have begun emphasizing their own local strengths and diversity. `` Cultural and technological over-centralization is dangerous, and if we do n't do something about it, it's likely to create cracks in our society,'' says <PERSON> Kazuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuriyama </PERSON>, head of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a grouping of <ORGANIZATION> Kansai </ORGANIZATION> businesses. For many Japanese, regional revitalization means a return to traditional values at a time when so many people no longer live with their relatives or in their hometowns. Towns are reviving and promoting local festivals, crafts and delicacies, while TV shows such as `` Rediscover <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' and `` Wonderful Trip Around <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' introduce the lifestyle and customs of local communities. Beer companies are introducing `` local flavor'' brews designed to appeal to local pride and taste, and the post office plans to release a new series of regional stamps. Even the national government is encouraging a shift away from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has said the government will distribute 100 million yen -LRB- $ 800,000 -RRB- to each of 3,200 or so villages, towns and cities for use in improvement projects. The Cabinet also is moving 79 secondary government bodies out of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s frantic screams rattled windows up and down <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, but no Samaritans on this quiet suburban street abandoned their Thursday night suppers to come to her rescue. Even Miss <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s friends and colleagues _ standing just yards from the violent poolside assault _ kept perfectly still. Finally, when he had seen enough, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCoteau </PERSON> looked at the fallen woman, put his hands in his pockets, and smiled a thin smile. `` OK,'' he said. `` Let's move on.'' As the director of the low-budget horror film `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corpse </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> DeCoteau </PERSON>'s mission was to produce dead bodies as quickly as possible _ such efficiency is the only way cheap movies can make a profit. The ugly death of Miss <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, slain by corpse-like hands rocketing out of a swimming pool, left one less butchering to film. Sparing every imaginable expense _ actors brought their own costumes, crew members earned minimum wage and almost everything but the 16mm film itself was borrowed _ the makers of `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' were able to film half a dozen garrotings and impalings in only five days. A visit to the `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' set illuminates a different, frequently overlooked side of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Unlike flamboyant, high-budget productions that swim with celebrities and hype, this film reflects true, unknown blue-collar labor _ much work, little acclaim. Where directors <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> might use a dozen or so camera setups in a day, <PERSON> DeCoteau </PERSON> -LRB- `` Nightmare Sisters,'' `` Creepozoids,'' `` Lady Avenger'' -RRB- raced through 57 moves in one 13-hour shoot. In the time it takes `` serious'' movie makers to shoot just one 15-minute sequence, the 90-minute `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' was already in the can. `` OK. Let's move on,'' is the battle cry of this brand of film making The plot of `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' is admittedly witless. A few studly young men stroll into a house, chat with two women who do n't wear much clothing, have sex with them, and then pretty much everybody dies The movie does not pretend to be anything it is not. Said screenwriter <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perron </PERSON>, asked if he minds his scripts being called exploitive: `` Why should I mind? They are.'' Its lack of sophistication aside, `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' could become more profitable than, say, `` Tequila Sunrise'' or a large percentage of the major studio releases now costing an average $ 17 million apiece. Made on a budget of only $ 50,000, `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' can, with any measure of domestic and international videocassette sales, realize a net gain. The dilemma on the set, then, was to keep costs so low they're subterranean, but still spit out a movie that, if little else, was in focus Though shots were hurriedly lighted and most scenes were captured in only one or two camera takes, <PERSON> DeCoteau </PERSON>'s genius rests on an aptitude to make really cheap films look only semi-cheap, delivering them on budget and on time. Only 26, he has directed or produced 12 B titles. `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' relied upon a good-natured, well choreographed ensemble of young technicians and struggling actors united by the challenges of guerrilla film making. A motorcycle used in one scene was appropriated from sound mixer D.J. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>. `` We cannibalize everything,'' said co-producer and first assistant director <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennamer </PERSON>. `` We used my car in ` Assault of the Killer Bimbos.''' Given a rare chance to work in a highly competitive business, the cast and crew of `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' willingly accepted pay far below union rates and read dialogue so wooden the script gave them splinters. `` All of us are stars on the way up. This is just a stop along the way,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is featured in `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' as a rock singer named <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> who _ through some fluke of the script _ actually walks away alive at the end of the movie. Out-of-work actress <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> -LRB- she played a nameless screaming woman in the 1988 remake of `` The Blob'' -RRB- shared <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' optimism On the set not as a performer but as the `` craft services'' supervisor, Ms. Fields spent one recent afternoon refilling the carrot-stick tray at the film's small snack table. `` It's nice working here,'' said Ms. Fields, a theater graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> who recently moved to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, `` because you make friends and they might have friends and then they can say to their friends, ` Hey, I have this friend who needs a SAG card.''' Membership in SAG, the Screen Actors Guild, is a Hollywood paradox: You ca n't act in a big feature film without a SAG card, but you ca n't obtain a SAG card unless you've acted in a big feature film. But for those actors and crew members who see `` Beverly Hills Corpse'' as a step up to a more glorious future, there are others _ like actress <PERSON> Linnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> _ who more or less revel on the lower rungs. Miss <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, whose resume includes `` Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers,'' `` Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama,'' `` Blood Nasty'' and the upcoming `` Assault of the Party Nerds,'' has established herself as the Meryl Streep of the slice-and-dice genre. Ask her to go topless -LRB- or more -RRB- or die a horrible death, and she'll meet the challenge gamely Said makeup artist <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>: `` She always knows her lines. She's always on time. And she never messes up.'' Yet it seems incongruous for Miss <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> to appear in movies featuring countless decapitations and other abuses: She is a vegetarian and animal rights activist. `` I wo n't do a movie where there's violence toward animals,'' she said. And though usually semi-nude on camera, she calls herself `` shy'' and says, `` I would n't feel safe at a nude beach.'' Ultimately, though, it is Miss <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>'s and Miss <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s naked bodies, not their death scenes or acting talents, that will bring `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Corpse'' whatever riches it might gather when it debuts on videocassette later this summer. The film, lacking both requisite quality and financial backing, will never make it to movie theaters. Like many of its independently produced kin, its future will be decided at video stores both here and abroad: With rentals costing a buck a night, home video fans have much more tolerance for lesser films. And since there are no ratings for videos, there's no such word as `` unsuitable.'' `` Most foreign markets wo n't accept adult movies,'' said screenwriter <PERSON> Perron </PERSON>. `` So horror movies -LRB- with nudity -RRB- fill the niche _ they pass right by the censors.'' While <PERSON> Perron </PERSON> talked, the real art of slasher film making was being discussed in the next room, where makeup artist <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> conferred with special-effects expert <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>. They wanted to make sure an upcoming throat slashing went well. As the two held up their own concoctions of fake blood, Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> suddenly looked very serious and said, `` Do you want the more jugular blood or the capillary blood?'' On such fine points, bad horror movies become better.

<BYLINE>A Solo ``Shirley'' Heads For Broadway</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> is Broadway-bound in a solo play that took <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> by storm last winter, but it's a mixed blessing for the British actress to go it alone in a foreign country. `` The sad thing is, you've got no one to nudge from the stage and say, ` Is n't this good or bad or whatever,''' said the lone performer in <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>,'' opening Feb. 16 at the Booth Theater. On the plus side, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> is appearing in material she admires, a luxury not always available to actors. `` First of all, I really love the play; I left -LRB- the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> run -RRB- feeling I had n't had enough,'' said the actress, best-known to Americans as <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, the downstairs maid in the popular British TV series `` Upstairs, Downstairs.'' Written by the author of `` Educating Rita'' and the current <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> musical `` Blood Brothers,'' `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'' is a lengthy, essentially comic soliloquy about a bored Liverpudlian housewife who at age 42 decides to do something about her `` unused life.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> emphasized that `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'' is more than a series of barbed, knowing one-liners. `` This is a play. That's the extraordinary thing about it,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said over coffee in the spacious north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home she shares with her husband, actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderton </PERSON>, and their three children. `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'' premiered in 1986 in <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s native <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, with local actress <PERSON> Noreen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kershaw </PERSON>. It opened on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s commercial West End last January, winning <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> the best actress award from <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> and a nomination for this year's <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> Awards A separate production opened in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, on Dec. 30. In the fall, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> beat out such candidates as <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> to repeat the part in the movie version with added characters played by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>. Due for release next September, it is directed by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, who filmed `` Educating <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>.'' The $ 750,000 Broadway production is being staged by its <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> director, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Callow </PERSON>, the British movie and stage actor -LRB- `` A Room With a View,'' `` Amadeus'' -RRB- making his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> directorial debut. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who grew up near <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, is confident that the British references and phrases in `` Shirley Valentine'' wo n't limit its appeal. `` There's always that which is undone in all of us, that little bit more you ought to do,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>'s dilemma, as the character takes solace from drudgery in her wit and dreams of escape. The role is partly a lighter variant of <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' previous West End assignment, replacing <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> as the anguished middle-class housewife in <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s `` Woman in Mind.'' But she feels `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'' has helped widen her acting range. `` It allowed me to move into an area closer to my own age, because I think when you have a round face, you tend to be caught in a peculiar nebulous youth for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, dark shoulder-length hair framing her full cheeks. `` Because of the way the world is moving now, there's a greater interest, and indeed a greater market, for plays about middle-aged people,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 48, who spent years playing pert and youthful comic leads in such vehicles as <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>'s `` The Importance of Being Earnest'' and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>'s `` Romantic Comedy.'' `` There are a lot of middle-aged people about with money to spend who want to see themselves on screen and stage and even as models.'' Television roles occupy much of her time. In the spring, she and her husband will appear in six one-hour episodes of a new show, `` Forever Green,'' about a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> couple who uproot to the country. Frequent collaborators, the couple were seen on American TV in the show `` No, Honestly,'' but they resisted offers to remake the series appearing as two Americans. Facing her first Broadway appearance, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> knows the stakes are high. `` The line between success and failure is very much stronger there; you're either a success, or you ai n't,'' she said. But she is philosophical about the much-vaunted power of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> critics. `` There's no point wasting energy worrying about that,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` All I can do is put the best I can into it and hope they like it. If they do n't, then presumably their power will close it, so I wo n't be suffering too long.''

<HEAD>Berlin Festival Exposes Scars of War 50 Years After Its Outbreak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> has paused for reflection on the conflict that divided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is probing the scars it inflicted throughout the world. The 39th annual film event has set no specific war theme for this year's contest and will in fact exhibit some prominent entries delving into unrelated subjects, such as <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s `` Mississippi Burning'' and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>'s `` Rain Man.'' But the festival, which opened Feb. 10, has coupled the Golden Bear competition with a retrospective marking what would have been the 100th birthday of German-American producer <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Pommer </PERSON>, and a showing of films made in 1939 that appear to have inspired European filmmakers to take another look at those troubled times. As a tribute to <PERSON> Pommer </PERSON>, who fled <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> the year <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> took power and returned after the war to rebuild the nation's film industry, the festival will screen 34 of the prolific producer's works, including `` The Blue Angel'' starring <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON>, and several films directed by his lifelong associate <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> <PERSON> Pommer </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1966. The wartime thread running through the festival is enhanced by the memorial series `` Europa 1939,'' which resurrects 50 films produced that year in 10 European nations, giving audiences a full taste of the society, culture and politics of a continent on the brink of disaster. An accompanying forum for young filmmakers likewise breathes in the historical atmosphere of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> a half century after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s march began <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Ophuls </PERSON>' critically acclaimed documentary, `` Hotel Terminus'' recounts the role of <ORGANIZATION> Lyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>. American filmmakers have offered `` Lodz Ghetto,'' about the largest Jewish ghetto set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, and `` <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Is Different,'' confronting Austrians' historical consciousness following the exposure of Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s Nazi past. The 12-day festival combines the international competition for the award for best new feature film with a number of other contests, premieres, exhibits and markets to draw thousands of the film industries most prominent directors, producers, cinema operators and film buffs to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Among the dozens of films to be shown for the first time outside their country of origin are <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Another Woman,'' and the first-ever joint film production by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` The Break,'' which follows the chaotic lives of a handful of Berliners in 1946. While <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has failed to embrace the broader freedoms `` glasnost'' has brought to the arts in much of the Soviet bloc, West German filmmakers and other artists are hoping `` The Break'' signals a new willingness among their socialist countrymen to work together in cultural and entertainment fields. Twenty-two full-length feature films are entered in the main competition, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> filmmakers out front with four entries. In `` The Summer of <LOCATION> Aviya </LOCATION>,'' directed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a young girl learns to cope with the mental instability of her mother, a survivor of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. Japanese director <PERSON> Yoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON> conveys in `` Hope and Pain'' the post-war resettling of some school children and their eventual rebellion against the imposed American order. `` American Stories,'' from <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akerman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, relates tales told by those who fled war-torn <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from their perspective as immigrants in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` Evening Bell'' by director <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziniu </PERSON> recounts a last-ditch attempt by Japanese troops to escape capture in the final days of World War II. Entries from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> include `` Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights workers in the 1960s; `` Talk Radio,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s story of a late-night talk show host driven by ambition to exploit his lonely listeners; `` The Accused,'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>'s account of a gang rape and its legal aftermath; and `` Rain Man,'' about the relationship that evolves between an autistic man and his self-seeking younger brother. Running throughout the festival will be 30 new full-length West German films and 46 from other nations, as well as the European Film Market offering more than 350 films for sale. Of the top 10 box-office successes in West German cinemas this month, seven are American comedies or thrillers. The only West German film offered at the festival that has been enjoying much popular success is `` Herbstmilch'' -LRB- `` Autumn Milk'' -RRB-, a sad but beautifully filmed true-life story of a young woman's hardships in wartime <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Recollections of Wartime Bavaria Stir Nostalgia for Simple Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bittersweet recollections of a Bavarian farm girl deprived of youth by her mother's early death and the hardships imposed by World War II have for more than four years been stirring a nostalgia for the simple life of bygone years. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimschneider </PERSON>'s true-life story, `` Herbstmilch'' -LRB- `` Autumn Milk'' -RRB- is a major motion picture in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As a subtitled commercial offering during the 39th <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, it will seek an audience worldwide. `` Herbstmilch'' was directed by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilsmaier </PERSON> and released last month by Senator Films in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. It will make its international debut at the film festival. The movie, shot entirely on location in the scenic Bavarian countryside around Wimschneider's village near <LOCATION> Pfarrkirchen </LOCATION>, adopts the harsh and simple style of the 1984 best-selling novel in its portrayal of life 50 years ago. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>'s naive bliss as the barefoot and carefree eldest daughter among seven children in the southern German countryside comes to an abrupt end when her 39-year-old mother dies after the birth of an eighth child. Eight years old and grieving, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> is forced to take over the exhausting farm chores and child care that sent her mother to an early grave. The young girl's father comes off in the film as a harsher man than the author recalls him to have been, beating her for bad cooking and for falling asleep at the sewing machine where late each night she sews by lamplight to earn money to feed the family. She finds a short-lived happiness in the courtship of a local farmer's son, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimschneider </PERSON>, and marries him at age 21. But the brief respite from hunger and hard work is broken when <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> is called off to the front and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> must care for the farm and her husband's family under the cruel eye of a hateful mother-in-law. Told entirely from the perspective of isolated villagers who see <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s politics and the emergence of World War II from afar, the film brushes only gently against the still-tender subject of the hopes inspired among poor Germans that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> regime would bring glory and prosperity. Wimschneider casts herself and her family as devoted Catholics skeptical of the Fuhrer, occasionally defying the social order by refusing to give the `` Heil <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'' salute in town. The few scenes in the film on the Nazi administration of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> depict the local party chief as a self-indulgent villain and the people of <LOCATION> Pfarrkirchen </LOCATION> as unquestioning but innocent followers. <PERSON> Vilsmaier </PERSON> also grew up near <LOCATION> Pfarrkirchen </LOCATION>, though a full generation after <PERSON> Wimschneider </PERSON>. `` The director was from the same part of Lower <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimschneider </PERSON>, which no doubt made this project an important and personal one for him,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Badewitz </PERSON>, who put together the series of 30 new West German films being shown at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> festival. `` There is a new generation of filmmakers that wants to examine history and its effects on the present.'' The film and Wimschneider's book have drawn some criticism, however, for the uncritical account of the Nazi influence and Bavarians' willingness to be led into a war that shattered the continent. The presentation that one reviewer described as `` dangerously sympathetic'' is likely a large part of the film's attraction for German viewers sometimes discomfited by the fever of retrospection in this 50th anniversary year of the start of World War II. <PERSON> Vilsmaier </PERSON>, whose Czechoslovak wife, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Vavrova </PERSON>, plays the role of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, focuses more on the lifestyle of wartime <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> than on the political and psychological questions still troubling the nation that propelled <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in the Holocaust and his destructive march through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The film and the book both close with a comment by the 69-year-old Wimschneider that sums up the nostalgia shared by many West Germans who remember the harshness of the war years while carefully avoiding recollection of the horrors: `` Now is the wish I have had since childhood fulfilled,'' she says. `` When I want to sleep in, I can sleep as long as I want.''

 When <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> idles its sprawling assembly plant here in August, one of the main engines driving this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town's economy will shift into neutral. About 1,200 employees already are on furlough, and 2,000 more will be laid off. <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> will lose its largest employer, which last year paid $ 830,000 in local taxes, spent $ 19 million with local suppliers and had a payroll of $ 59 million. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> McWey </PERSON>, a 28-year-old single mother who earned $ 13.18 an hour at the plant, wonders who will pay the bills if she or her 5-year-old daughter gets sick. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> hardware store, worries he may have to lay off some of his 11 employees. `` One thing affects the next,'' he said. `` You ca n't keep everyone on when you're losing a customer that did $ 100,000 worth of business.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> says the troubled plant, which has gone through at least five shutdowns since 1977, may one day reopen. But industry analysts doubt it, and many workers no longer can tolerate the on-again-off-again nature of the operation. The same painful uncertainty is felt in <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and other communities nationwide where the No. 1 automaker has been reducing production capacity for the first time in its 80-year history. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, which has suffered a steady erosion in its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market over the past several years, announced last April that it would start closing plants in an effort to bring capacity into line with sales. The reaction on Wall Street has been enthusiastic; <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $ 1.25 to $ 73.375 a share on the day of the announcement and has since climbed to about $ 93. But the impact on Main Street has been severe. `` Talk to any shop owner, any pizza place, any package store in this town,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, a 34-year-old Framingham native who worked at the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plant for four years. `` It's not just the 3,000 jobs. It's a whole domino effect.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> says the 40-year-old <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> plant is one of four in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> making <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centurys </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cieras </ORGANIZATION>, all of which have been running at well below capacity. Eliminating <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> says, will make the other three _ in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ste </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Therese </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Aripze </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ more efficient. <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, meanwhile, is feeling recriminations. Some workers blame Local 422 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> for refusing to agree to work-rule changes that might have saved the plant and their jobs. Some union activists accuse executives of mismanaging the plant. If there is a consensus, though, it is that the plant's fate was sealed on a single night two years ago _ June 17, 1986 _ when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> asked for a zoning change to allow the 54-acre facility to expand and build plastic-body mini-vans. <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, population 65,100, calls itself `` the largest town in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' because it is the largest community still run by an old-fashioned <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town meeting. With the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> independence that town meetings are known for, residents peppered <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials that June night with questions about noxious emissions, storage of plastic resins and truck traffic. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>'s director of public works, remembers the answers as incomplete and the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials as haughty. `` It appeared they thought they were above questions,'' he said. After a lengthy debate, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> fell three votes short, 69-39, of the two-thirds majority needed for a zoning change. This month, the automaker began retooling its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, plant to make the plastic mini-vans originally slated for <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>. On Feb. 1, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced that the <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> facility would shut down indefinitely because `` it does not have any new product to manufacture.'' Some residents saw the announcement as spiteful. But the president of the local <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, said the town has only itself to blame. `` What infuriates me is that this plant had a product two years ago that would have ensured its continuation into the 1990s, and the town turned it down,'' she said. `` That's something we have to face up to.'' In other moves to reduce manufacturing capacity last year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> laid off 4,000 workers at a Firebird-Camaro factory in <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; 2,500 at a stamping plant in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; 2,350 at a Fiero plant in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; and 1,300 at a Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac facility in <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Even with those closings, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> still has excess capacity and probably will have to shut at least two more plants to meet its stated goal of using 100 percent of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car-making capacity by 1992, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Framingham may be better off than some other affected communities, because it has a diverse economic base that includes computer manufacturing, stationery making and a 375-room hotel In addition, the unemployment rate in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, at 3.3 percent, is the lowest of any major industrial state. To help workers exploit job opportunities in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> have opened a retraining center, and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has announced a $ 250,000 state grant to help fund it. The <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> plant reopened in May, after a November 1987 shutdown that put 3,700 out of work. When it reopened, more than 1,000 workers with 20 years or more of experience were among those called back. Hopes began anew. `` Because there have been so many layoffs, the perception in everyone's mind is that, ` I'll get called back,''' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grniet </PERSON>, a 24-year veteran of the plant, after the latest layoff announcement. But some workers, frustrated by the recurring layoffs and startups that afflict the auto industry, are trying to ensure that the coming shutdown is the last they have to endure. `` I know I'm going to make less money and everything,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON>, 42, who was laid off and recalled four times in nine years at the plant. `` But enough is enough. I've got to find another job and get on with my life. ... Even if they reopen again, I do n't think if I'm going to come back.

 Moslem guerrillas who have been fighting the Afghan communist regime are deeply divided, with widely differing visions of the kind of government and nation they want to build. The seven main Afghan guerrilla groups and dozens of small or splinter groups range from moderate traditionalists sympathetic to the old <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> monarchy to fundamentalist Islamic revolutionaries. But the main problem, most leaders say, is who will come to power after the expected fall of the communist regime now that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has pulled its forces out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` There is much hope, but there is also much doubt about the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, a senior guerrilla, in one of a series of interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> invasion was the greatest challenge in Afghan history,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arghandewhal </PERSON>, another guerrilla official. `` Now there is an equal challenge to rebuild <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' Rival guerrilla groups have clashed in the past and show no sign of mending their divisions despite an outward show of unity. Several guerrilla groups reportedly have been stockpiling weapons for years for use in any internal struggle for power. The guerrillas say they agree on forming a democratic <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> government under an elected head of state and legislature. Beyond that broad outline, they are vague. `` We want to make everyone a part of the future, but not everyone can be a -LRB- government -RRB- minister,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a guerrilla military commander. Many Afghans dismiss suggestions that they will wind up with a radical Islamic state comparable to the one Shiite Moslems created in neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Most Afghans belong to the rival Sunni sect. But moderate Afghans fear the future may hold little toleration for different or modern ideas if some of the more radical guerrilla organizations control any future government. `` Afghans are Moslems, but most do not want to live under a government that tells them how to live or how religious they must be,'' said one Afghan exile. Any struggle for power will be complicated by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s historic disunity and instability The nation is deeply divided between ethnic, tribal, linguistic and religious groups that have competed for power for centuries. Past Afghan governments exerted little real control outside the cities and large towns. A major task in rebuilding <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> now will be finding ways to ease the divisions and promote a common sense of nationalism or face chronic feuding, guerrilla leaders say. `` This is a major problem that the war has made worse. We must solve it, but we can not do it with slogans,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, a guerrilla official. A prolonged struggle for power could erupt between the rival guerrilla parties, the many different ethnic and regional groups and the semi-autonomous guerrilla military commanders who actually control many parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to some analysts. `` Civil war is possible if the leaders do not come up with a solution to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s problems,'' <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could be divided into small, warring states under rival guerrilla commanders in the same way <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was broken up among rival power groups, analysts say. Any central government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital, would be as ineffective and divided as the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> government, they said. `` I hope <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will become like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after the war, not like <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said. The thousands of guerrillas from rival groups must be disarmed to ensure the restoration of stability and allow construction of an effective civilian government, Afghan analysts say. But they add that it will be hard to persuade guerrillas who have fought for years to surrender their weapons and power, especially when there will be few jobs or other rewards in the desperately poor nation. `` We must succeed with the pen as we succeeded with the gun,'' <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said. `` The mujahedeen -LRB- Islamic holy warriors -RRB- must go school, the people must go back to farming. It will not be easy.'' Other guerrilla officials say Afghans are exhausted from a decade of war and would turn against any of the guerrilla groups that start a struggle for power. But only the main guerrilla groups, they acknowledge, have military power. The threat of chaos and disunity will increase if <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbors and the superpowers compete for influence in the country, guerrilla officials and analysts say <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which armed and backed the guerrillas, hope a new government will be friendly to them. At the same time, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is likely to be troubled by a government unfriendly to it. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also wants a voice in the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to counter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani influence in the strategic nation. Iranian-supported Afghan Shiite guerrillas also are also expected to seek a strong voice in a future Islamic government despite opposition from Sunni guerrilla groups, who are in the majority. `` We must remember that we are all Afghans. Only that way can we solve our problems,'' said <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>.

 In a courtyard outside a modest physical therapy ward, 8-year-old <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazir </PERSON> practices hairpin turns at top speed in his new wheelchair. Six months ago, doctors amputated his legs above the knees after he was wounded in fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` He's one of the lucky ones,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertens </PERSON>, who works for a West German foundation that helps young victims of war. `` After more surgery, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> will someday be able to walk again with the help of artificial legs. Many of the other children have serious bone infections. Many will lose more limbs.'' <PERSON> Nazir </PERSON> is among 46 Afghan children who have been flown to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within the past month for treatment with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Friedensdorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a group that has been helping children wounded in wars for more than 20 years. Thirty-one badly injured Afghan children arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Feb. 2 after a two-day ordeal that <PERSON> Friedensdorf </PERSON>'s director, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON>, described as `` one of the most difficult we have ever made.'' The children and their four guardians arrived at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on an airline passenger jet by way of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` It was the only way to get them out,'' said <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON>, referring to the necessity of booking seats on a jetliner ill-suited to accommodate wounded children. There was no space for stretchers and the children could lie only as flat as the seatbacks would allow, <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said. `` These children have suffered terribly and there are thousands more just like them in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in desperate need of help,'' <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said at his office at <LOCATION> Friedensdorf </LOCATION>, or Peace Village, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Oberhausen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said that among the children was a 14-year-old girl whose leg was shattered by shrapnel during a rocket attack. `` She had already lost one leg and the wounded leg developed a serious infection,'' <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said. `` We hope we can save the leg because otherwise she'll end up a beggar on a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> street.'' <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> had high praise for the doctors in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but said they were working under impossible conditions. `` The doctors there are working around the clock. But they ca n't create antibiotics by magic. He said crates of antibiotics are stacked up and idle at border staging points, unable to be delivered because of the fighting and bureaucratic delays. The Afghan children were taken to hospitals across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> immediately after their arrival. Their treatment is paid for by donations. Many doctors perform surgery without charge, <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said. After they are released from the hospital, the children convalesce at <LOCATION> Peace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a cluster of cottages and rehabilitation facilities on a quiet, green hill outside industrial <LOCATION> Oberhausen </LOCATION>. Friedensdorf was founded in 1967 and immediately began helping children wounded in the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said the village continues to help <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> children, whom doctors say are suffering from the effects of the dioxin-laced defoliant Agent Orange. The foundation also has helped children from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatamala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and several African nations.

 The Aviation Trust Fund's surplus has grown to $ 6 billion, a reserve that its critics complain has helped the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hide some of the federal deficit. If the trust fund were handled that way by a private trustee, complained <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, `` he would have been indicted for misappropriation of funds.'' An effort to separate the aviation fund from the overall federal budget failed last year, but the airlines have vowed to try again in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the airlines are not free of fault either, according to their critics. Most of the capacity problems that exist today _ as well as many of the problems envisioned for the years to come _ stem largely from the strategies the airlines have devised under deregulation. Their concentration of flights at `` hub'' airports has caused massive peaking of traffic in and out of cities such as <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Since 70 percent or more of the passengers in many cases are only passing through these airports, layover time is minimized and a large number of planes must land and depart in a short time. On the other hand, airports at smaller cities often beg for more business. `` We do n't have a lack of airport capacity. We have a lack of airport capacity the way we use it today,'' argues <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group representing airport managers. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> maintains that many airports in mid-sized cities are underused and are often ignored as possible hubs. Officials in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, have offered $ 30 million over 10 years to any major airline that would start a hub there, but there have been no takers, he says. The airlines argue that they need significant local traffic to make a major hub successful. As traffic increases, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> predicts, pressure will mount for carriers to seek out the smaller cities as well. The airlines also have been criticized for not following up on their own rhetoric on the construction of new airports. They cite the example of the proposed <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> airport. Planners foresee no fewer than 12 runways, although half that many would be built initially for the scheduled opening in the mid-1990s. But both <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, who are the major carriers at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, have balked, arguing the plan is too grand, too expensive and unneeded at this time, especially in light of the region's economic downturn. Airports are largely financed through the issuance of bonds, which are paid off from fees assessed to the airlines. Continental claims the new <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> airport would add $ 36 to the price of a ticket, compared to the $ 4 surcharge at the current <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Frederico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, who has staked his political career on getting the airport built, makes no secret of his anger toward the airlines. `` Either we have a crisis in air transportation in this country or we do n't,'' he said. The irony of the airlines' position in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has not been lost on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureaucrats. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>, transportation secretary under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, called the airlines' stand in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> as well as the industry's lukewarm attitude toward developing a third major airport in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area `` irresponsible and hypocritical'' at a time when the industry talks of a capacity crisis. `` It's time those who come to conferences in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and sound off about the perceived shortcomings of the federal government in this area to get their own houses in order if they want to see capacity of the system grow in the years to come,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. Spokesmen for both <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> insist the two airlines continue to favor construction of a new <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> airport, but the question is one of cost. `` We'd like to build one that we can afford and we'd like to build it in the time frame that we need,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. Airline reluctance to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a new airport may be understandable, suggest industry analysts, in light of other costs facing the air carriers. As of last October, the scheduled air carriers had orders and options for 1,301 new aircraft worth $ 59 billion and the airlines are still ordering new jetliners, according to <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. And there are competitive questions that come into play at an airport such as <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> dominate, or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> are supreme `` If you own the hub,'' says <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, `` you're not too interested in adding capacity so somebody can come in and share your nest. That's just a fact of life.'' That may be one reason why the industry has yet to develop a master plan as to where any new airports should be built. <PERSON> Gabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the airline trade group, says such a master plan `` would be difficult to get agreement on'' because of the costs involved. Nevertheless, insist the airlines, the greatest barrier to the construction of new runways and airports is not the industry, but local opposition _ or the `` NIMBY folks'' as they have been called. The `` not in my back yard'' philosophy is not likely to go away soon, says <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. And if new airports and runways are not built, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> predicts the government will have no choice but to restrict traffic where there is n't enough capacity. `` We'll have de facto re-regulation whether we call it re-regulation or not,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> says. The answer, in the view of many industry executives, is for the federal government to become more aggressive in pushing for new airports or airport expansion where the lack of capacity is seen as impeding commerce. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> calls suggestions that a new runway or airport might be forced on a community as `` hopelessly naive'' and adds: `` You're simply not going to be able to politically run roughshod over the rights of neighbors of airports. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not let us do that.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steelworkers </LOCATION> officials say they will ask four major steelmakers for an early start to contract negotiations and will demand a share of the industry's renewed profits when the talks begin. `` Our people have made great sacrifices for a great many years. We might as well get at it,'' <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Wednesday. Contracts covering about 43,700 union members are due to expire July 31 at <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the third - through sixth-largest producers respectively `` We're prepared to meet on a schedule that's mutually satisfactory,'' said <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreckelsen </PERSON>. The union has agreed to two consecutive rounds of contract concessions since 1983. `` Our members are working in 1989 for 1982 wage rates at best,'' the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> said in a 36-page statement approved by a 400-member strategy committee. The <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> will negotiate separately but concurrently with the companies. The talks will cover 20,500 workers at <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, 11,600 at Inland, 7,000 at National and 4,700 at <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> represents only a portion of the workers at <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>. The contract with the largest producer, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, runs to early 1991. Second-ranked <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> both are in Chapter 11 reorganization and will negotiate when they emerge from bankruptcy court. `` Our union's fundamental goal is ... to raise the standard of living for our members in every possible way by negotiating improved income, cost-of-living protection, better benefits and working conditions and more secure employment,'' the committee statement said. After losing $ 12 billion from 1982-86, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry made profits of more than $ 3 billion in 1987-88 and is expecting another good year in 1989. `` Our members have made an enormous contribution to the success of the industry,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The success they've had should be justly and fairly shared with our members.'' He said union negotiators will emphasize a basic wage increase over profit sharing. `` They're entitled to have some guaranteed improvement'' in pay, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The union also wants restrictions on mandatory overtime and the hiring of non-union contractors. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said all the companies are requiring excessive overtime rather than hiring additional employees, which increases pension and benefit expenses. `` We think that's wrong,'' he said. The companies' claim that overtime is necessary because skilled workers are not readily available is `` a reflection of the failure of the industry to maintain its training and apprentice programs,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. For similar reasons, non-union contractors are used to maintain equipment and clean plants, he said. <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said they've found cases where companies have contracted for janitorial services at $ 50 to $ 70 per hour and maintenance services at $ 75 to $ 100 per hour when <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members could have done the work for half as much or less. `` Some of these prices blow your mind,'' said chief Counsel <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> figures released by the union, from December 1982 to October 1988 the average hourly earnings of steelworkers, including overtime earnings, rose 2.5 percent, from $ 14.40 to $ 14.76, while those of coal miners rose 20.8 percent, from $ 13.20 to $ 15.95, oil refinery workers rose 22.2 percent, from $ 13.49 to $ 16.49, and auto workers rose 24 percent, from $ 12.98 to $ 16.09.

<HEAD>Bank Board Chairman Supports Bank Takeovers Of Thrifts In Rescue
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The multibillion-dollar savings and loan crisis does n't mean the death of the industry, but more banks may assume the role of thrifts, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says. `` You have to understand in this country we have had a very high commitment to home ownership,'' a goal aided by savings and loans, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> told a meeting of international bankers Wednesday. Wall also said the government actively would seek restitution from fraudulent thrift executives, whose actions have contributed to the industry's losses, said to be accruing at the rate of $ 500 million a month. He said the $ 90 billion bailout plan announced this week by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not signal the demise of a financial institution created in the 1930s to help Americans buy single-family homes. Wall, who is from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, said there were `` thousands of banks'' in that part of the country whose business was much the same as thrifts, which traditionally have catered to individual depositors or mortgage seekers. `` Over time, I'm convinced we should allow those kinds of institutions to borrow from federal home loan banks,'' he said. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the plan for dealing with the hundreds of troubled thrifts includes a reversal of a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> ban on allowing bank holding companies to own thrifts. Under the plan, which must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, banks would be allowed to absorb insolvent thrifts immediately and acquire healthy institutions beginning in 1991. `` We are overruling the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, legally,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said, adding that he expected banks to enter the thrift industry as soon as they are allowed to. Wall told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> that the expected infusion of investment money from banks would invigorate and perhaps save the thrift industry. One of the possible results of the plan is the eventual merger of the banking and savings and loan industries. Savings institutions have lower capital requirements than banks, a practice that would be modified under the government plan.

Wall also pledged to crack down on thrift institution fraud, and cited a $ 50 million infusion of money under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan to beef up federal prosecution of such crimes. He said the bank board, which does not have the power to prosecute cases, last year obtained $ 100 million in settlements, excluding a $ 50 million malpractice settlement with a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> law firm involved in the failure of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> thrift that has yet to be paid.

 <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wants to cover up alleged bribes to her predecessor by using an international body to secretly settle a lawsuit over a $ 2.3 billion nuclear plant. `` Defendants ... do n't want a public accounting in their own country,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Wednesday in a statement issued through the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They would rather have a secret arbitration in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> where evidence of their action would be kept secret.'' The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> filed court papers Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here opposing arbitration. In December, the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government sued <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary and plant designer <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an Oradell-based engineering firm. The government says the contract for the nuclear power plant should be canceled because of allegations that bribes were paid to former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Other allegations include substandard work and construction of the plant, located on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> about 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, near an earthquake fault. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> says the lawsuit is politically motivated and that independent analysts have verified the safety of the 620-megawatt plant, which was completed in the final months of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration in 1985 but never put into operation. In mid-December, it filed a motion asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> to stay the lawsuit pending arbitration by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. In its 70-page memorandum, the <ORGANIZATION> Phillipines </ORGANIZATION> says a contract clause calling for an arbritrator to resolve differences between the plant builders and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is invalid because the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> was forced to sign the agreement although it opposed it. `` Rather than competing for the project on the merits, the defendants conspired together to pay multimillion dollar bribes for the benefit of former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to assure they were awarded the contracts for work on the project,'' the memorandum says. The payments were allegedly arranged through <PERSON> Herminio </PERSON> <PERSON> Disini </PERSON>, who was married to the first cousin of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and wired to secret Swiss bank accounts, it said. `` We deal here with a criminal scheme of bribery, graft and fraud carried out by the defendants at the highest level of the Philippine government,'' the document says. `` It is this criminal scheme that invalidates the arbitration clauses upon which the defendants base their motions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials, who said they only briefly reviewed the new documents, said they contained no new information. `` They are trying to avoid arbitration ... by saying there was some type of fraud,'' <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briskman </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence showing fraud by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>.'' The memorandum was accompanied by four volumes of evidence documenting the government's claims. Although the volumes were not immediately available, a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said they included over a dozen sworn statements from top <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> officials opposing the construction of the plant, including the head of the power corporation. Also included are statements from a former <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> executive and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> sales representative who allegedly participated in the scheme, and documents seized in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> documents prove that President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' favoring of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> at the expense of the government and <ORGANIZATION> NPC </ORGANIZATION> was not disinterested, but was done by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to protect his financial stake in the transaction,'' <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has since been indicted on unrelated federal racketeering charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but has not appeared before the court due to illness. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> plans to file a response in March, continuing to push for arbitration, and the judge is expected to make his ruling sometime after that, <PERSON> Briskman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Audi Loses In Car-Owner's Appeal Of Product Liability Case Involving
5000's</HEAD>

 A product-liability judgment that requires <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 100,000 in damages for acceleration problems with its <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 is another public relations setback for the automaker, an analyst says. A three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reinstated a lower court jury verdict that awarded punitive damages to <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. She was injured along with her three children when an <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 smashed through their apartment in 1983. The car's driver, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, told police the automobile lunged forward suddenly. Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hely </PERSON>, said the ruling demonstrates <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>'s liability for a design defect. Auto industry analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling only adds to public relations problems for <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>, which has been dealt poor sales reports because of an unintended acceleration case it eventually won. `` The monthly sales numbers for Audis have been dismal since all of the publicity around the unintended acceleration arose last year,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales were 60,000 cars in 1986, 41,000 cars in 1987 and 23,000 cars in 1988. Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>' attorney shared <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>'s belief that the ruling was poor for public relations. `` Because the truth comes out in this opinion about how they covered up and how they made a correction that was obvious they had to make, it really reflects terribly on the company and how they handled this matter,'' <PERSON> Hely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hely </PERSON> had contended in lower court arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> knew the accelerator and brake pedals were put too close together and sometimes caused drivers to step on both simultaneously, prompting the car to lunge forward. A civil jury last March decided <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for the design problem, awarding Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> $ 100,000 in punitive damages and $ 14,000 in compensatory damages. But Superior Court Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> sided with company attorneys and set aside the higher award, finding there was no proof <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> knew the car had problems and failed to correct them. The appeals court's 16-page decision reverses <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>. In January, Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> asked the appeals court to reinstate the punitive award, while <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> simultaneously asked the appeals court to also set aside the $ 14,000 award. The company said the appeals court opinion is directed only at the lower court judge's discretionary powers. `` The appellate court apparently based its decision on the feeling that the judge in the lower court had abused his discretion. We disagree with that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` We feel the judge acted within his discretionary rights and we are looking very carefully to see what additional remedies we might have,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 that it would take corrective measures to `` prevent inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same time,'' according to court papers <PERSON> Hely </PERSON> filed in arguing the case last month. Internal <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> documents and a government report conclude the car would lunge when the accelerator and brake pedal were pressed simultaneously, and the pedals were arranged close enough that the accelerator often is applied when the driver tries to brake, <PERSON> Hely </PERSON> said. The documents show <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> knew as early as 1979 of the defect. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment about the internal documents filed by <PERSON> Hely </PERSON>, saying they were not properly introduced because they were not authenticated. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> improperly allowed introduction of the documents, even though it was <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> who provided them to the court. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the company's options include trying to obtain another appeals court hearing. <PERSON> Hely </PERSON> said he expected the appeals court decision to stand, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would not grant a motion for the justices to hear the case. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> stressed that the case did not involve unintended acceleration, which involves the car lunging forward uncontrollably when it is placed in gear.

<HEAD>Sources: Chicago Board Of Trade Won't Ban Dual Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, in an effort to restore confidence in its ability to regulate itself, is considering a number of changes in trading procedures, sources said. But the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commodities exchange, does not intend to stop brokers from making transactions for customers as well as their own account, according to the sources. Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> directors are reviewing other trading practices and have voted to spend $ 1 million to improve the computerized trade-monitoring system, according to people who attended his private, one-hour meeting with members Wednesday. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> also announced during the meeting that the exchange's directors have voted to increase the maximum fine for offenses to $ 250,000 from $ 75,000, the sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> officials have scheduled another membership meeting today, at which they are expected to announce plans to develop a computerized system for after-hours trading. The practice of traders making transactions for customers and dealing for themselves is a controversial one known as dual trading. The <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> directors' unanimous endorsement of dual trading was seen by some as a sign the exchange will not bend to criticism at a time when the futures industry is under intense scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors. The government has launched a massive investigation into suspected fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and dual trading is one of the practices under examination. The undercover probe, which was disclosed Jan. 19, is tied to allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s futures exchanges cheated customers out of millions of dollars in executing their orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of commodities, ranging from soybeans to foreign currencies Critics contend that dual trading creates opportunities for unscrupulous traders to cheat customers. But supporters of the practice say it provides a financial incentive for independent traders to work in the exchange's pits, thereby increasing the efficiency of the futures markets. `` I believe in dual trading,'' said one exchange member who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` I believe it should happen and should continue to happen.'' Commodities exchanges are overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency, but the creation and enforcement of many trading rules is left up to the individual exchanges _ a policy that is favored by <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> leaders. <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> officials would not comment publicly on Wednesday's meeting. But one exchange source said privately that some of the exchange's largest users, including agricultural concerns and pension-fund managers, had lobbied in favor of retaining dual trading <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said other trade practices _ including curb trading, in which traders execute a few buy or sell orders after the closing bell _ are under review, sources said. They said <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> told members that the exchange's computerized trade-monitoring system, which creates a minute-by-minute record of trades, was about 95 percent accurate. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said that with scheduled improvements, the system should be able to reconstruct trades with 100 percent accuracy, the sources said.

<HEAD>EPA Sues Kaiser For Alleged Pollution Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES L. ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has sued <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly violating pollution standards at its <LOCATION> Trentwood </LOCATION> plant east of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. If found liable, the company could be subject to civil penalties of as much as $ 25,000 per day of violations for each of eight emission points, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said in a news release. A Kaiser spokeswoman, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON>, called the complaint, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, `` totally inappropriate, completely unnecessary and most regrettable.'' According to the civil suit announced Wednesday, the federal government seeks a permanent injunction against <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> prohibiting violations of visible emissions standards caused by releases of particulate matter. Also sought is an order directing the Trentwood plant to comply immediately with clean air regulations developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> and approved by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regional spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. The complaint accuses the Kaiser plant of exceeding emissions standards for particulate matter `` on numerous occasions since 1984.'' The Trentwood plant rolls and ships such products as beverage can lids and heat-treated sheets, plates and coi formal notice, giving the company 30 days to correct the problem, said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. The complaint alleges that smoke stacks from the same plant furnaces continued to violate federal and state standards after the 30-day grace period expired. Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> spokeswoman, said in a prepared statement that the company has spent nearly $ 500,000 `` redocumenting that particiulate matter within these occasional bursts of smoke from our remelt area were well below every health standard by which one measures.'' <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> also announced last month that it would install $ 1.8 million in pollution-control equipment to reduce emissions from the casting area. Since the regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office was aware of these steps, <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> was shocked when the civil suit was filed, Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> said. In essence, the debate centers around the so-called `` opacity standard'' developed by the state. Industries are restricted in the amount of time that their smoke stacks can exceed 20 percent opacity _ basically, seeing 80 percent of what one should be seeing. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> uses that opacity standard as an indicator of how much particulate matter is in the air. When an opacity standard is violated, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> assumes that the federal particulate air standard is violated as well. <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> and others have argued that opacity standards do not truly measure the health or environmental impact of material escaping from stacks. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> contends the opacity standard is the best available way to measure particulate matter. Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> has been working in good faith in the past year with the county <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office on an equitable solution to what it calls `` an arbitrary visual emissions standard that has no relation to scientific fact or to health.'' The aluminum company had also sought a local variance and a change in state law to permit any industry or regulatory agency to undertake studies that would lead to the establishment of a scientifiically sound standard. `` We suspect that this regrettable decision -LRB- to sue -RRB- by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> was reached in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> without even checking at the state and local level to find out how much progress has been made,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> said. `` Someone far removed from the scene appears to just want to chalk up a mark on the wall as an enforcement undertaken.'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, however, said the civil action originated in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> `` It was our idea. We pushed it and there was concurrence from headquarters,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> would seek to meet with all the parties involved in an attempt to settle the dispute. If that fails, the company is prepared to vigorously contest the action in court, she added.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading information technology company, will strengthen its presence in the American market through its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, a bank automation concern, company executives and analysts said. The <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> company announced Wednesday it has agreed to be acquired and subsequently merged with <ORGANIZATION> Bunker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ramo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Shelton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Ivrea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The deal will create one of the leading computer systems suppliers serving the financial services industry, analysts said. `` This acquisition reinforces our worldwide position in banking automation,'' <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassoni </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION>'s managing director and chief operating officer, said in a prepared statement. `` It greatly expands our market share in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, complementing our leading role in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The merger transaction, valued at approximately $ 174 million, calls for the purchase of all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> common stock at $ 12.25 per share in cash. The combined companies, which will have headquarters in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, had revenues of approximately $ 250 million in 1988, of which <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION>'s share was $ 175 million The merger would give the new company the third-largest market share among firms selling automated financial services systems, behind <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindeblad </PERSON>, current president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, who will remain in that capacity in the new company. About 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of more than $ 6 billion in 1988 were to the banking industry, but little of that was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMerritt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. Analysts who follow <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> said the merger offers a good fit of companies in both domestic and international markets. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Ragen </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> could gain from <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> would get a toehold in the European market dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> company, which has a large share of the domestic savings and loan market, also stands to benefit from its association with <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramo </PERSON>'s commercial banking ties, he said. `` There are probably some synergies involved,'' agreed <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` They can take <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> software and couple it with <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramo </PERSON> hardware and tie it all into <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> mainframes. It's probably a better package and it gives <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> a better product to market.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramo </PERSON>, will become chairman and CEO of the as-yet unnamed company. <PERSON> DeMerritt </PERSON> will become vice chairman. ISC Systems is a leading supplier of Pinnacle branch automation systems to savings and loans, credit unions, and commercial banks in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. It also markets its products in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramo </PERSON> supplies branch automation systems, mostly to commercial banks. <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> announced Dec. 22 it would begin discussions with a possible suitor. The announcement coincided with a restructuring that could eliminate as many as 120 jobs at its <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> operations, where 750 people were employed as of Jan. 1. <PERSON> DeMerritt </PERSON> said the merger will mean the loss of some jobs and reshuffling of others. The reorganization announced before the merger will continue, he said. <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said the restructuring, expected to be completed by June, will result in a workforce of between 630-650 people. The acquisition and merger is pending approval by <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and federal regulatory agencies, <PERSON> DeMerritt </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1977 and its products serve more than 2,700 financial institutions, employing 1,700 worldwide. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramo </PERSON>, which employs about 600 people in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, was purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Its systems are found in 750 financial institutions.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it is temporarily halting savings and loan rescues until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes up with more money for the S & amp; L deposit insurance fund. In a statement Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said it will halt all deals until it is finished taking control of 224 insolvent institutions over the next month under orders from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. After that, it will only deal with cases that can be supported by the cash of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> officials said perhaps three or four liquidations would be completed this quarter, but rescue deals would not go forward The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s Wednesday statement confirmed those comments, made at a briefing for reporters.

<HEAD>U.S. Blocks EEC Quest For Probe Into Food Import Curbs</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blocked a demand Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> for an official probe into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duties on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> food imports, imposed to retaliate for an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hormone-treated meat. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, which charges that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s measures violate international trade rules, made its bid at a regular two-day council meeting of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> sets global trade rules and is a forum for resolving trade disputes. It traditionally operates by consensus. EEC delegate <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van-Thinh </PERSON> urged a quick probe and warned of a further deterioration in the latest transatlantic trade dispute, a meeting source reported on condition of anonymity. Many delegations backed the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s criticism of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measures in a council debate Wednesday. But at Thursday's session, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> request for an investigation by a panel of neutral <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> experts, saying it was premature. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and EEC trade officials are scheduled to hold talks on the issue in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week. The discussions could become more complicated if <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> were to begin an investiation, he said. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> also supported the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> call for a panel. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s import ban on hormone-treated meat went into effect last Jan. 1, affecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of beef and veal valued at more than $ 100 million. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> said meat treated with hormones could pose a health risk, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> disputes. In response, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> immediately slapped high duties on imports of European food products including boneless beef, ham and pork shoulders. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers approved a plan Jan. 23 to impose 100-percent duties on imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> walnuts and dried fruit. But the ministers delayed implementation to give more time for negotiations and said they would review the situation Feb. 20 before making a final decision on retaliation. Barring a quick settlement, the U.S.-EEC row is likely to resurface at an emergency <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting Feb. 21. <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> officials scheduled the session at the request of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which wants to renew pressure for a ruling on whether 100-percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs on Brazilian drugs, paper products and consumer electronics violate trade rules. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed the sanctions last year because it said <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> laws insufficiently protect foreign pharmaceutical patents. On Wednesday, some 50 countries backed <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> isolated. But <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> vetoed the Brazilians' second request for an investigation, noting that the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is still formulating its position on the case.

<HEAD>Oil Field Services Firm Reports Fourth-Quarter Earnings Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its earnings plunged 36 percent in the final quarter of 1988 due to the reorganization of its logging and geophysical businesses. The oil field services firm reported net income of $ 11.8 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $ 639 million. That compares with earnings of $ 34.1 million, or 32 cents a share, on $ 456 million in revenue in the same 1987 quarter. `` Lower worldwide drilling activity during the last three months of 1988 put pressure on our oil field services group's profitability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruikshank </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cruikshank </PERSON> said about 335 fewer drilling rigs were active worldwide during the fourth quarter of 1988 than a year earlier. `` We believe this weakness in oil field service markets will continue during the first half of 1989,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> reorganized its logging and geophysical business units in the fourth quarter by forming <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The company said the restructuring cost $ 27.2 million in the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> said it expects savings by reducing duplicate efforts, cutting staff and realigning international operations. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 93.6 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $ 2.17 billion. That is nearly double 1987 earnings of $ 48.1 million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $ 1.55 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit rose 9.8 percent, driven by best-ever performances for the period by its filmed entertainment and its cable and broadcasting divisions. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, which also reported strong gains by its recorded music operations, said it earned $ 101.1 million, or 63 cents a share, for the final three months of 1988, compared with $ 92 million, or 59 cents a share, in 1987. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 17.6 percent to $ 1.20 billion from $ 1.02 billion a year earlier. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> earned a record $ 423.2 million, or $ 2.65 a share, up from $ 328.1 million, or $ 2.09 a share, in 1987.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Continues To Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It seems inevitable that if interest rates continue to rise, as conceivably they could, many American consumers will have their confidence factors squeezed. But nobody, including the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, can be sure. So far that confidence has been almost immune to actual, potential and threatened events, including the great stock market crash of l987, which created a shiver so tiny that it had dissipated by Christmas. Since then, consumers have gone on their merry way, spending and borrowing with confidence while professional economists regularly talk about such things as inflation, recession, rising interest rates and other ogres. None of these has daunted the great American consumer, suggesting that it might take something of an economic earthquake to slow the propensity to spend. In December, consumer debt rose $ 5.4 billion to a total of $ 667.3 billion. That increase, 9.9 percent on an annual basis, was n't a fluke. In November, consumer credit rose at an 8.5 percent annual rate. In October the rate was 7.2 percent. Borrowing for cars and retail items rose. Credit card debt rose too. The increases are explained variously by analysts as a natural byproduct of job security, rising personal income, faith in the new administration, belief that prices are `` right,'' the absence of runaway inflation and the like. All these and more are the ingredients of confidence, and that confidence, at least superficially, seems ready to penetrate all obstacles, including a 10-month effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to restrain economic growth. Will it, though? The test of that confidence is now, when higher taxes and high interest rates combined might toss a wet towel of reality at some borrowers. Credit-card interest rates, for example, already are high, historically and in comparison to most other rates. Many issuers of cards charge close to 20 percent. Some charge even more, not counting annual fees. Should there be further increases, mainly from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that interest rates are an effective and necessary restraint on the economy, levels will be reached that once were considered intolerable Making them worse still will be higher taxes. True, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems determined to avoid any new taxes this year, but an old one continues to add pressure. Whereas 40 percent of installment debt was tax-deductible last year, only 20 percent will have that status in 1989. Debt is increasingly costly. A psychological factor enters the picture: The realization of how costly that debt will be might not be impressed upon people for another year. That is, the true impact might not come until borrowers complete their 1989 taxes. It is a seemingly deadly combination until you reflect that nothing over the past year, including the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, has been able to penetrate the consumer's armor and shake up that confidence Early returns suggest strong spending will continue in 1989. Aided by balmy weather, major retailers reported January sales gains of 6 percent to 10 percent, and a large part of such sales historically are on a credit basis. Meanwhile, automotive dealers are ready for a big spring selling season, adding to the temptation to use even more credit. After that comes the lure of vacations and the cost of wedding and graduation gifts. Temptation is out there, and over the past year it has been strong enough to defy restraint. It provokes the question of just what will undermine consumer confidence if high taxes and interest rates are unable to do the job.

<HEAD>FASB Proposes New Rules To Record Pension Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board today announced a controversial proposal to change the way companies account for pension benefits, a plan which could significantly impact company profits. The proposed new rules, scheduled to take effect in 1992, would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to deduct promised post-retirement medical and insurance benefits as they are earned, or while an employee is still working for the company. It would eliminate the `` pay-as-you-go'' accounting method currently used by most companies. As such, companies in many cases under the new rule would have to deduct from their income statements the amount of the earned benefits, instead of simply deducting the amount the companies actually paid in a given year. Critics of the proposal have complained that it would impact financial results too greatly, as well as being difficult to manage. The new rules would deal only with financial reporting of benefit obligations but does not address the funding of pension benefits, <ORGANIZATION> FASB </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The plan comes at a time of soaring health care costs, longer life expectancy and earlier retirements which are posing economic problems for many companies, according to <ORGANIZATION> FASB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON> said the proposal would make financial statements more informative and complete and would enhance disclosure of promised benefits. `` It will require companies to publicly acknowledge their existing commitments to investors and other users of financial statements who in turn can evaluate the implications of those promises,'' <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON> said. He also said the proposed accounting would not change the nature or extent of the current pension promises. `` The cost of providing the promised benefits is the same before and after the proposed accounting is implemented,'' <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Northwest Orders 10 Airbus A330 Jetliners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten Airbus A330 jetliners worth a total $ 860 million have been ordered for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to use the high-tech aircraft in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and on high-volume domestic routes, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, said the order was the largest to date of the A330s, valued at $ 86 million each. The A330 is a two-pilot, two-engine aircraft seating 303 passengers in a configuration of three different fare classes. The first A330 will be delivered in July 1994 with the remaining nine airplanes to enter the Northwest fleet by the end of 1994, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We have a strong commitment to the Airbus A330,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` The A330 is state-of-the-art technology with efficient <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines that provide superior operating economies with great customer comfort and appeal.'' The A330 will incorporate the technological advances that <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> has pioneered with the A320, including fly-by-wire flight control and enhanced avionics, the company said. Northwest has ordered 100 of the smaller A320s for domestic use and 20 of the larger A340s for international travel. Northwest also selected <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s PW4000 to power the new A330s. The engine order is worth $ 250 million, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that a company controlled by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, one of the nation's biggest travel agencies Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Conference Board: Expansion Will Continue But Growth To Slow</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's economy will continue to expand in 1989 but growth will slow slightly, according to a report by a panel of economists to be released Friday. The panel of 13 economists sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> projected that real gross national product will rise about 2.5 percent this year, down from about 2.7 percent in 1988. The group also projected that inflation would rise to 5 percent from 4.2 percent, the prime interest rate would hold steady at about 10.5 percent and unemployment would increase slightly to 5.5 percent. `` Under present circumstances, a slowdown this year should be looked upon not as a signal of economic weakness but as a necessity,'' said <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, economic counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a worldwide organization of corporate executives. `` Faster growth of the economy would seriously heighten anxiety about the financial markets, which in turn would be manifested in the form of higher interest rates, more inflation and perhaps an earlier recession,'' he said. The panel said the economic expansion of the last seven years will be fueled by capital spending and international trade. Spending on plant equipment is projected to climb 6 percent to 7 perent, down from a 10 percent rise in 1988. But members of the panel said they foresee no progress in reducing the federal budget deficit, instead projecting it will increase to $ 158 billion in fiscal 1989, up from $ 155 billion.

The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to auction $ 9.5 billion of new 30-year bonds today as the final step in its quarterly financing. An issue of 10-year notes sold on Wednesday was met with what analysts described as a cool reception, suggesting that interest rates would have to move up to increase demand.

<TEXT>
 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> dropped sharply Thursday in erratic trading punctuated by concerns about interest rates. Caution prevailed following the market's recent strong surge, and participants were unwilling to push prices above the psychologically significant 2,100-point level on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index. Persistent fears of rising rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which could forestall a hoped-for decline in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s interest rates, focused attention on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presentation of the fiscal 1990 budget. At the close, the FT-SE 100-share index was down 17.1 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,079.1. The index dropped as much as 19.7 points as market makers knocked prices lower in early business. There was little selling pressure hitting shares, dealers said. Selective buying at lower levels pulled the FT-SE index up to its best level late in the morning, when it was up 0.8 points. But the market took another dive after Wall Street opened for business with fresh losses. The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 11.8 points at 1702.9. Overall volume was brisk, as 830.1 million shares were traded, little changed from 830.9 million shares on Wednesday. However, a good portion of this reflected trading between market makers, dealers said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index closed at 1,175.23, down 7.30.

 <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported more than a three-fold increase in 1988 fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, partly because of the big consumer-products firm's sale of the <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> health care subsidiary. The company said earnings totaled $ 126.7 million, or $ 1.85 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $ 38.4 million, or 56 cents a share in the corresponding 1987 quarter. Sales rose 5.9 percent to $ 1.21 billion from $ 1.14 billion. Earnings for the entire year totaled $ 317.8 million, or $ 4.64 per share, a five-fold increase over the $ 54 million, or 78 cents per share for 1987. Sales totaled $ 4.7 billion last year, up 8.4 percent from 1987's $ 4.36 billion. In addition to a $ 125 million gain on the <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> sale, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>'s financial figures were affected by a $ 42 million, or 61 cents a share, accounting charge to cover a one-time payment under a new royalty and research agreement at the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s Pet Products division.

<TEXT>
 This is a town that's witnessed judges on the take and politicians on the make and a school of scandal whose roster has drawn from the courts, the cops, even City Hall. Now the feds are creating a stir in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s business arena with a massive fraud investigation of the high-stakes, frenzied futures exchanges, the world's largest commodity markets. But in a city that once was <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s turf and has recently seen police convicted of protecting drug dealers, judges booted off the bench for taking bribes and aldermen put behind bars, talk of skulduggery in the risky business of financial futures elicits more knowing smirks than disapproving scowls. `` Since the political process has sanctioned corruption so long, the fact that it occurs in business is no great surprise to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a former alderman. `` Chicagoans are not much surprised -LRB- that -RRB- people are stealing with big bucks as opposed to a $ 500 bribe. It's not shocking to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mentality.'' `` It's like a spectator sport,'' said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, an associate professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois-Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` It'll be interesting -LRB- for people -RRB- to see if 50 traders go to jail or 20, or if it's a millionaire or some runner. It's like watching a bullfight or a football game. There is n't condemnation There is n't outrage that it would be a crime.'' Nobody has yet been indicted in the probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where millions of dollars are made and lost on future prices of items ranging from soybeans to foreign currency. The investigation purportedly involves charges that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers and profited in illegal deals. In the probe, dubbed Operation Sour Mash and Operation Hedgeclipper, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents reportedly posed as traders, leased luxury apartments and wined and dined brokers, recording conversations with hidden tape recorders and wireless microphones disguised as pens and rings. The probe of the trading pits follows a history of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> scandals and scoundrels, ranging from men who wore cleats _ eight members of the 1919 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> who threw the World Series _ to men who donned judicial black robes and fixed court cases. At times it seems as if the city of Big Shoulders has become the home of greased palms. `` Things that happen here all the time would bring down a government in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said political strategist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who's worked in several mayoral campaigns `` One thing that contributes to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s reputation for corruption ... is the higher tolerance -LRB- for it -RRB-.'' Though citizens are sometimes jaded, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said, they still get annoyed. `` We accept it and we make jokes about it -LRB- corruption -RRB-,'' he said, `` but I think basically deep down we do n't like it.'' Neither do prosecutors, who've successfully used federal laws to combat local fraud. Since 1972, 13 aldermen have been convicted of federal corruption charges. Two were convicted and two others await trial in Operation Incubator, which used <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> mole <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> to uncover influence peddling in City Hall. There's also been Operation Phocus, a probe of shakedowns involving city licensing, Operation Lantern, which investigated alleged payoffs in city purchasing, Operation Deadfall, in which 30 police officers admitted they took small bribes to steer corpses to certain funeral homes, and Operation Greylord, the probe of the nation's largest court system in which 81 people, including 13 judges and 46 attorneys have been convicted or pleaded guilty. Those cases do n't even take into account vote fraud during the heyday of the political machine when <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> earned a dubious reputation as a place where names from tombstones sometimes found their way to the voting booth. The machine's quid pro quo philosophy _ favors for votes _ left open all kinds of opportunity for fraud, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Royko </PERSON> said in `` Boss,'' his book about the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, that there were so many deals involving ranking machine members it was suggested <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> change its slogan from Urbs in <LOCATION> Horto </LOCATION>, or `` City in a Garden,'' to Ubi Est Mea, or `` Where's mine?'' But much has changed: the machine has weakened, many abuses have been curbed and court orders have diluted the once-powerful patronage army. Some also say <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s image is distorted and its problems are no worse than other big cities. Still, constant exposure to public corruption affects the way people view <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s business world, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a local watchdog group. `` Very few Chicagoans look at a bunch of Chicagoans ripping off international markets as all that bad,'' he said. `` We've adapted to things in this city -LRB- and -RRB- laugh it off -LRB- thinking -RRB- who's getting hurt? It is n't us. It's the fat cat investors, the big corporations. It's boys will be boys. I do n't get any big sense of ` Is n't that awful?''' One reason is few people have a financial interest or understand the commodities markets, with its clubby atmosphere and chaotic shouting, jostling and flashing hand signals. `` Unless one is involved in one of those markets and had some concern about being ripped off, there's less concern than if a politician is on the take,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. In this era of Wall Street scandal, there's also mistrust and even disdain for traders. `` The reputation of these people is right up there with dope dealers,'' <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said. `` You hear about these people buying unbelievable houses and cars because of killings they made in the market ... They're such high rollers. There's absolutely no sympathy out there.'' As for the trading floors themselves, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, many expect fast-and-loose action in such a make-or-break atmosphere. `` For most people on the outside,'' he said, `` it looks like a big poker game. It's like if you suddenly found out in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> the poker table was n't completely on the up and up.'' But even if the investigation results in evidence of widespread fraud, many say the impact will be on the trading industry, rather than <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I tend to think of this as a generic financial scandal rather than a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> scandal,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think -LRB- people -RRB- look at ... -LRB- <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> scandal,'' he said, referring to the notorious speculator whose prosecution for inside trading led to a broad crackdown on security abuses in Wall Street. Yet others say <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ca n't afford any more trouble because it hurts the city, particularly its efforts to recruit investors. `` It affects the image, which <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> does n't need,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and now executive director of a firm that investigates white-collar crime. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> can take its place among any other city of the world without this kind of nonsense.'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> says it's frustrating because outsiders seem to be more interested in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s seamy side than its world-class attractions. `` If you talk about <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, do they talk about the Art Institute? Do they talk about the beach front?'' he asked. `` They ask, `` Is it still as bad as its always been? ... We have n't shaken that image and that's tragic.''

Analysts said there were no significant supply-and-demand developments during the session and prices drifted with no firm direction. The slight decline in wheat prices was due mainly to profit-taking by a few large trading houses, analysts said. At the close, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.25 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.64 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 3 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.06 \ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with March at $ 7.46

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported a 28 percent increase in fourth-quarter income, but said earnings fell 8.5 percent in 1988, mainly reflecting an after-tax loss related to an adverse arbitration ruling. For the three months ended Dec. 31, income amounted to $ 64 million, or 74 cents a share, up from $ 50 million, or 55 cents a share, in 1987's corresponding quarter. Revenue totaled $ 1.98 billion and $ 1.84 billion in the same two quarters. Profit, after taxes, for all of last year was $ 234.4 million, or $ 2.67 per share, compared with $ 256.3 million, or $ 2.92 per share in 1987. Revenue came to $ 7.3 billion in 1988 and $ 7.2 billion in 1987. Last year's results included a $ 37.7 million after-tax loss stemming from a $ 28 million adverse arbitration ruling involving a former insurance subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Avco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> insurance business, and from a $ 9.7 million loss due to the early redemption of high interest debt rate. The increase in 1988 income reflected higher operating profits in the commercial products area and in the propulsion segment as <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lycoming </ORGANIZATION> division recorded record revenue and profit following a mid-year seven-week work stoppage, the company said. The Providence-based <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> is a multi-industry company with operations in three sectors: aerospace technology, commercial products and financial services.

 High short-term interest rates are pulling investors' cash into money market mutual funds, pumping the funds' assets up to new highs, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual funds grew $ 2.26 billion in the week ended Wednesday as they set a record for the fifth consecutive week, the institute said. The rise, to $ 287.62 billion in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed an $ 18.5 million increase in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.

<HEAD>Fourth-Quarter Earnings Down 78.8 Percent; Restructuring Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY ANDERSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported record fourth-quarter revenue Thursday but a 78.8 percent drop in earnings, attributing the results to one-time costs in the behemoth retailer's fight to spruce up its image <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' earnings of $ 117.4 million, or 32 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $ 554.4 million, or $ 1.46 per share, for the century-old company in the year-earlier period. The fourth consecutive quarterly earnings decline was attributed to a $ 500 million outlay for the massive restructuring announced last fall. The company is attempting to streamline and overhaul its market approach to offer low pricing, more contemporary displays and outside brand names. One analyst said he considers the fourth-quarter showing a prelude to a major upswing for the company. `` Sears lacked two ingredients to growth,'' said analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landschulz </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Cowen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` One was competitive pricing. The other was a power format _ a really aggressive marketing tool. I think these changes address both these key weaknesses.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has not yet begun an all-out promotional campaign to alert consumers to its metamorphosis. But <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, company chairman and chief executive officer, also predicted an improved balance sheet, calling 1988 `` a year of major transition.'' The fourth-quarter plunge reflected after-tax accounting charges of $ 442 million for the restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and $ 58.6 million for a loss on the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> group life and health insurance, the company said. Fourth-quarter revenue totaled a record $ 14.56 billion, up 9 percent from $ 13.36 billion for the year-earlier period. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has said the restructuring includes the planned sale of the landmark <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> and Coldwell Bankers commercial real estate subsidiary, plus the buyback of 10 percent of its 380 million outstanding shares. The company said it would concentrate on consumer-oriented businesses _ retailing, insurance, residential real estate and financial services. Before the restructuring charge, the company said, fourth-quarter earnings totaled $ 618 million or $ 1.65 per share. For the year ended Dec. 31, earnings totaled $ 1.45 billion or $ 3.84 per share, 11 percent down from $ 1.63 billion or $ 4.30 per share in 1987. Revenue totaled a record $ 50.25 billion, up 9.5 percent from $ 40.95 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said 1988 results include the adoption of new income tax and insurance accounting standards, and discontinuance of <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s group life-health operations and <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial division Revenue for all previous periods was restated for the discontinued operations and the new accounting standard, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reported a fourth-quarter loss of $ 113.5 million after the $ 442 million restructuring charge. Before the charge, the group's fourth-quarter income was $ 328.5 million, down from $ 414.9 million in 1987.

 A falling dollar and rising interest rates sent stock prices broadly lower Thursday, pinning the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average with its largest loss since the first session of 1989. Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips fell 20.17 to 2,323.04, for its biggest point drop since it lost 23.93 on Jan. 3. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 504 up, 1,003 down and 461 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 224.22 million shares, up from 189.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 256.79 million shares. The dollar fell in foreign-exchange trading, and prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, dropped more than $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auctioned $ 9.5 billion of new 30-year bonds Thursday as the final step in its quarterly financing. That and an issue of 10-year notes sold on Wednesday met with what analysts described as a cool reception, suggesting that interest rates would have to move up to increase demand. The interest-rate outlook has also been unsettled by the prospect of a large new amount of government borrowing to help finance a plan to straighten out the problems at many savings institutions. Analysts said traders in all the markets turned cautious as they awaited President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget message scheduled for Thursday night.

 The dollar dropped sharply Thursday as traders speculated that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would say nothing new in his budget message about cutting the federal deficit. In its biggest one-day decline in weeks, the dollar lost roughly 1.2 percent of its value against such currencies as the West German mark, Japanese yen, British pound and Swiss franc. The sharp drop came after several steady sessions in which dealers had been reluctant to trade actively because of uncertainty about what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would say in his Thursday evening address. On Thursday, traders guessed the speech would be negative or at best neutral for the dollar and decided to sell before others did, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's almost the market attempting to anticipate the anticipation of others,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` Everybody saw somebody making it for the door and said, ` Wait.''' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.11 Japanese yen to a closing 129.39 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 128.53 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar sank to 127.93 yen from 129.38 yen late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Crunched By Bearish USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report showing a larger-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle herd knocked cattle futures prices to the mat Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but analysts were skeptical of the report's accuracy. On other markets, cotton futures prices fell sharply; grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals futures declined; and energy futures were mixed. Prices for all cattle futures except the February live cattle contract plunged the permitted daily limit of 1 -LCB- cents at the opening bell and stayed limit-down for the rest of the session. The contract for February delivery of live cattle settled 1.40 cents lower at 73.97 cents a pound while the near-month feeder cattle contract, for delivery in March, settled at 82.92 cents a pound. Pork futures prices fell in sympathy with the cattle market. Live hogs finished .50 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 41.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to 1.13 cents lower with February at 37.57 cents a pound. The sell-off was triggered by Wednesday's semi-annual <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle inventory report, a head count of the nation's cattle herd. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reported there were 99.5 million cattle and calves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as of Jan. 1, only a few thousand fewer than the previous year. The industry consensus expectation was for the herd to total fewer than 98 million cattle. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report implied that after six years of thinning cattle numbers, producers were starting to rebuild their herds. But many analysts said they did not believe the report, especially its implication of an extremely high birth rate in the second half of 1988. `` We had a 92 percent calving rate, the highest in 15 years, in a year when you had the driest, hottest summer since 1932,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This looks like one of those aberrational things where you've got to wonder what's going on here,'' he said `` There are just too many contrary things to come into -LRB- the report -RRB- to really believe it.'' Analysts said the bulk of the futures selling appeared to have come from speculative commodity funds, not cattle producers or beef processors, possibly an indication that the beef industry also was skeptical of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> numbers. Cotton futures prices fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations that another <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report would be bearish for the cotton market. And so it was. In a monthly supply-demand report issued after the close of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton stockpile on Aug. 1 would stand at 9.2 million bales, compared with the January estimate of 8.8 million bales and the Aug. 1, 1988 stockpile of 5.8 million bales. Cotton settled .80 cent to 1.75 cent lower with March at 57.64 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in dull trading ahead of the same <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> supply-demand report. In the report, the government lowered its estimate for 1988-89 Argentine soybean production to 9 million metric tons from 11 million metric tons and lowered its 1988-89 Argentine corn production forecast to 6 million metric tons from 8 million. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also lowered its 1988-89 Soviet grain production estimate by 5 million metric tons to 195 million. Analysts interpreted the report as neutral to slightly bullish for grain and soybean futures. Wheat settled 1 -RCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with March at $ 4.25 \ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.65 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.06 a bushel; soybeans were 1 \ cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ Gold and silver futures retreated modestly in technically-inspired trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1.10 to $ 1.30 lower with April at $ 398 a troy ounce; silver was 2.4 cents to 3 cents lower with March at $ 5.915 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices finished narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in an uneventful session. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 9 cents higher with March at $ 17.39 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent lower to .27 cent higher with March at 48.61 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to .58 cent lower with March at 48.36 cents a gallon.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company, reported a $ 224.4 million fourth-quarter loss Thursday, attributing the results to travails that ranged from federal safety probes to labor-management turmoil at its Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries. The October-December performance compared with a $ 265.6 million loss in the year-earlier period, and widened the overall 1988 loss to $ 718.6 million _ 54 percent greater than the $ 466.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> lost in 1987. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reported losses of $ 101.7 million for the quarter on revenues of $ 844.4 million. That compared with a loss of $ 143.4 million on revenues of $ 1 billion in the same period a year earlier. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> incurred a fourth-quarter loss of $ 99.2 million on revenues of $ 1.1 billion. During the same period in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 78.8 million on revenues of $ 1.1 billion. Fourth-quarter revenue for the parent company totaled $ 2 billion vs. $ 2.1 billion in the year-earlier quarter. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> revenue totaled $ 8.6 billion, the same as the year earlier. Eastern lost $ 335.4 million on revenues of $ 3.8 billion for all of 1988. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 181.7 million on revenues of $ 4.4 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 315.5 million on revenues of $ 4.7 billion for all of 1988, vs. a $ 258.1 million loss on revenues of $ 4.1 billion in 1987. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said the 1988 results `` reflected the numerous and unprecedented challenges faced by both <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern during the past year'' and that future results at the two airlines `` will reflect the fact that these challenges are being successfully met.'' In 1988, both airlines were subject of an unprecedented investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which determined the two carriers were run safely. The probe, however, concluded that labor turmoil at Eastern must be defused before it creates risks to passengers. The turmoil intensified this week with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s militant machinists, who were voting on whether to authorize a strike next month. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON>, quit after a year on the job, becoming the carrier's sixth former president in as many years.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All three measures of the nation's money supply advanced in late January, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 900 million to a seasonally adjusted $ 787.1 billion in the week ended Jan. 30 from $ 786.2 billion in the previous week. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 600 million to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,072.0 billion from $ 3,071.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 900 million to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,920.6 billion from $ 3,919.7 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last year set a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,067.8 billion, a 4.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,911.4 billion, up 5.2 percent, while M1 rose 2.0 percent to an average of $ 787.8 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported discount window borrowing, exclusing extended credit, averaged $ 698 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 263 million in the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 288.0 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from $ 290.7 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Japanese Automakers Introduce New Sports Cars</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday unveiled a new two-seat roadster, a throwback to the 1960s aimed at a part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market with no competition. The M-5 Miata is scheduled to go on sale in <LOCATION> Mazda </LOCATION> dealerships nationwide this July. At a base price of less than $ 14,000, the Miata is targeting a segment of the car market largely vacated. One reason is the rising expense of imports, a result of the dollar's lower value in recent years <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another Japanese automaker, said it planned an introduction of its new two-seat Acura sports car. At a reported price of $ 55,000, it's at the other end of the price scale from the Miata. The carmakers disclosed their plans at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s annual auto show, an important forum for rivals vying for a chunk of the lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. Officials from all major manufacturers have been holding press briefing prior to the show's official opening Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> also unveiled a new version of its RX-7 sports car with a redeveloped rotary engine that boosts horsepower while improving gas mileage. The changes also pushed up the RX-7's base sticker price by about $ 1,000 to about $ 17,000, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, vice president for sales and marketing <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm There are no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or imported two-seat sports cars in Miata's price range <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> officials said Miata, a front-engine, rear-wheel drive car, was designed specifically for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said the company planned to import about 20,000 Miatas this year, and boost that to about 40,000 annually after that. The two-seat sports car market has been shaky in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> during the past several years, <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said, dropping from 2.4 percent of the entire car market in 1986 to 1.3 percent last year. He said <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> thinks interest in the car remains, but the rising prices have made the cars less affordable. Among domestic carmakers, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday they plan a newly designed <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION>, descriibing it as a rounder version of the hugely successful top-of-the-line luxury model. They declined to disclose the cost. The Town Car for 1990, which is nearing production, will retain its traditional interior size and trunk space but it could be longer than current models despite being built on the same platform, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON>, vice president for sales of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s North American operations. Base prices for the 1989 Town Car range from $ 25,562 to $ 29,709. The 1989 Town Car Signature V-8 engine remains for 1990. A new standard feature is air bags on the driver's and passenger's side of the front seat. <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> also suggested <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> might produce a successor to the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer. No date was set.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> employees and local business leaders were still wondering about the company's future Thursday as the record $ 24.53 billion tender offer for the food and tobacco giant expired. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Doss </PERSON>, a 22-year veteran of the company's <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, voiced a concern held by many workers: How would <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s new owner, repay the massive debt it took on to buy the firm? `` I'm concerned about layoffs and possible cuts in benefits,'' <PERSON> Doss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is acquiring <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> through a leveraged buyout, which involves heavy borrowing. LBO debt is repaid through the sale of a company's assets or with its cash flow, and cost-cutting and job reductions often result. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> workers also worried about who would eventually run the company and whether the tobacco division's headquarters would be moved from <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>. The possible economic and social impact of the buyout could be far-reaching in <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where an estimated $ 1.5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stock is held by individuals and where thousands of jobs are linked to the fate of <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock expired Thursday morning, and the investment firm said it had been tendered approximately 97.2 percent of the outstanding common shares. <PERSON> Doss </PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> worker, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who has put in 14 years at the tobacco company, said they tendered their <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stock before Thursday's deadline. They also could have sold their shares of the stock, which closed at more than $ 100 a share on Wednesday. `` People were selling their stock and others were buying it,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` So I guess that says something about the faith they have in it.'' <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> also announced Thursday that <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sticht </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, had been appointed acting chief executive officer, replacing <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who resigned. A group led by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> made the first move toward buying <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> back in October and then fought a losing battle against <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>. Ever since the takeover fight began, stories circulated of production-line workers who would become millionaires as stock prices nearly doubled. Those stories were tempered somewhat by the rumors of layoffs and cutbacks. Thursday's developments passed with little notice in the streets around the tobacco company's headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischel </PERSON> said it was not considered a landmark day at the division. `` I'd say most of the excitement right now is centered at the banks and stock brokerage firms,'' he said. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordenholz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected there would be more fireworks before the deal was finalized. `` When you're involved in battle, the adrenalin begins to pump when the first shots are fired,'' he said. `` We're waiting to see what happens.'' It was not immediately known when the acquisition would be completed.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it wants to cut its non-essential costs by 15 percent and may do so by trimming its work force, selling businesses or ending product lines. `` I think it would be inaccurate to call this a job reduction plan,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` We're asking unit managers to start looking very closely at their businesses and start making some decisions from the viewpoint of profitability.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said costs directly related to raw materials and production wo n't be subject to the cutbacks, but that all of the company's products and business units will be reviewed to determine whether they're worth keeping `` Over the last eight years <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has made a lot of strategic acquisitions,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` What we have n't done is a lot of strategic divestment.'' The announcement came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> reported record sales and earnings in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 profit rose 19 percent to a record $ 1.4 billion, or $ 4.31 a share, compared with $ 1.2 billion, or $ 3.52 a share, in 1987. Sales rose 28 percent to a record $ 17.03 billion, up from $ 13.3 billion in 1987. The results were boosted by the contribution of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> acquired in February 1988. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the comprehensive look at the company is part of the changes that have taken place at <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> since the company began a massive reorganization in 1984.

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it will move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and expand support facilities in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the tune of $ 40 million and 1,400 jobs in the next year. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will remain the airline's primary hub, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> told an <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> news conference. But the carrier wants to participate `` in one of the most dynamic growth areas of the country'' by moving its corporate base to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The airline, which began operating in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> a year ago with the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, will build new maintenance facilities at both <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> as well as a headquarters building in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. `` This aggressive expansion program coupled with our already announced plans to increase our fleet by a net of 22 additional aircraft this year will fuel a 35 percent company-wide growth in employment over the next 12 months,'' <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. He estimated the annual economic impact of the expansion program at $ 250 million in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and $ 50 million in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The headquarters move is to begin in May and involve about 125 professional and clerical workers now at Love Field in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The airline also will build a $ 10 million maintenance facility in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The company wants to `` reinforce our commitment to the growth and prosperity'' of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub by building a $ 10 million maintenance operation there, reopening a reservations center, expanding the number of airport gates and increasing daily flight departures to 105 by mid-summer, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. The number of employees in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will climb from 1,475 to 2,000 by mid-summer, he said, and jump from 720 to 1,165 in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> during the coming year. Some 450 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees will remain in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, mainly in financial and administratrive jobs, company officials said. The chairman called <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> a `` niche carrier'' that is `` fast becoming a major carrier'' with good growth potential in a highly competitive industry. `` We expect to turn a profit in 1989,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 with nearly $ 1 billion in debt. It started flying again in 1984 as a low-cost, no-frills carrier. The airline was acquired by investors last summer, shifted most of its flight operations to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and began trying to attract more business travelers by increasing its daily departure schedules. It then ordered more than $ 2 billion worth of new airplanes. `` We will need these -LRB- new -RRB- facilities and the new personnel to support our growth plan,'' <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. The Philadelphia-based investor group controlling the company is <ORGANIZATION> CoreGroup </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chodorow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> serves 31 destinations from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 16 from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. It has more than 4,000 employees, including 440 pilots, and operates 53 aircraft.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> executives informed members Thursday of plans for an electronic trading system that would operate during hours when the trading floor is closed, sources said. Exchange Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the system was designed to give foreign investors easier access to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s burgeoning market for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures, according to exchange members who attended the closed-door meeting But industry observers said the move into computerized trading by the world's largest futures exchange appeared to be prompted by a federal investigation of suspected fraud at the Board of Trade and the rival <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal apparently represents a 180-degree turn in philosophy for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, which last fall decried a similar system being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> as inefficient, prone to abuse and a poor substitute for the traditional `` open-outcry'' method of futures trading. A Board of Trade spokesman said he could not comment on the meeting. One veteran trader who attended the meeting said <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> touted the proposed system as `` the closest thing to the open-outcry system'' and thus superior to the <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> system being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. Like <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s system would use a computer to match orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of financial instruments. Also like <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, the system would be open to other futures exchanges that wish to list their products for trading. But unlike <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> is developing in partnership with London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the Board of Trade system would be developed and owned entirely by the exchange and its members. The exchange plans to hold several smaller meetings with traders over the next three weeks to explain the system before putting it to a membership vote March 2, according to traders who attended the meeting. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> would retain its 21-month-old night trading session for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures, a successful effort to attract more business from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Details about the electronic system were sketchy and many traders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, left the meeting confused. `` If the floor vote were held today I do n't think it would pass,'' said one trader. `` Not because people are against it in principle, but there are just too many questions about it.'' Industry observers linked the exchange's change of heart about electronic trading to the recently disclosed investigation of futures trading. `` What this whole scandal has done is to bring up the time when computerization is the norm,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` As soon as you mechanize, you're removing the human element, and the human element is what this latest furor is all about,'' added <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, an associate professor and co-director of the Futures and <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Electronic trading systems use computers to match buy and sell orders. Several foreign futures exchanges already operate such systems. All commodities trading in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now is done by professional traders who crowd into recessed pits on exchange floors and execute customer orders through a combination of shouts and hand signals. Abuse of this `` open-outcry'' trading method is the apparent target of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation revealed on Jan. 19. Federal authorities reportedly are investigating allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars while executing their orders in the futures markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> is seen as a way to make its financial futures markets more convenient for overseas customers. Last September, Board of Trade President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> urged the federal <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> not to approve <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, contending in a letter that the proposed system was `` inherently susceptible to manipulation, prearranged trading and other abuses.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> approved <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> last week. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which trades crude oil and platinum futures, and the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Futures Exchange of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> have agreed to list some of their products for <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> trading.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, making his first appearance before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, proposed a $ 1.16 trillion budget Thursday night that would increase money for social programs but freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. He promised to `` work day and night'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fiscal house in order. In a prime-time, nationally broadcast appearance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed slashing $ 2.6 billion from the defense budget proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to help offset costs of the expanded domestic programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in prepared remarks to the heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also voiced his personal support for making <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> the nation's 51st state and called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to take the necessary steps to let the people decide in a referendum. And he said he would set up a new Task Force on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Saying, `` The most important competitiveness program of all is one that improves education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he traced a number of schooling initiatives. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech was not a State of the Union address _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> produced one on paper before leaving office last month _ but it stood for one, touching upon key foreign policy issues as well as the entire range of domestic concerns. The president's budget plan, which features a one-year freeze on scores of federal programs, calls for roughly $ 5 billion more spending than the budget submitted by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month and carries out <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-stated vow of not seeking any increase in taxes. He said his offer to freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending was conditioned on reaching an overall agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that included budget reforms. He proposed that the government go to a two-year budget process, rather than one year, and asked like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before him for the power for a line-item veto. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first presidential speech mixed campaign promises with expressions of budget restraint and new overtures toward bipartisanship. Initial reaction from congressional leaders was cordial. `` The Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to work with this president in every way that we can,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a taped response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech that was carried on television networks. `` We'll give him our sincere cooperation. That does not mean obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated a vow from his inaugural address to extend a hand to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` My team and I are ready to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work night and day _ if that's what it takes _ to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time.'' Among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s major proposals were: _ An increase in funding for the space program of $ 2.4 billion over the current year. _ Indefinite postponement of three oil drilling leases `` which have raised troubling questions,'' two off the coast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> `` which could threaten the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>.'' _ A $ 1,000-per child tax credit for low-income families and a $ 3,000 deduction to help defer the cost of adoptions. _ The first installment toward $ 500 million in grants for the nation's best schools, rewards for teachers, and an expansion of the Head Start program. `` I have said I'd like to be ` the education president.' Tonight, I ask you to join me by becoming ` the education <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,''' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> devoted the bulk of his speech to domestic issues, talking about the expanded programs he had promised during his presidential campaign. But he also said that `` securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address.'' He said it was a time of `` great change in the world,'' and while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be encouraged by signs of reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> clings to `` objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours.'' He promised to `` vigorously pursue'' development of a space-based missile defense shield, the so-called Star Wars concept, and declared that chemical weapons `` must be banned from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' He also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must persevere in its support of anti-communist freedom fighter movements around the globe. `` The hands remain extended, the sleeves are rolled up, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is waiting, and we must produce. Together, we can build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He noted that he had first entered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber 22 years ago, when he was sworn in as a freshman congressman from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Referring to the chairs behind him where the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and the vice president sit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Eight years ago, I sat in that chair as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates, people out of work, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> confidence on the wane. Our challenge is different.'' Noting the record six-year peacetime expansion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` We are headed the right way. But we can not rest.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a new aggressive push in fighting `` the scourge of drug abuse,'' including a $ 6 billion budget to fight drugs, nearly a $ 1 billion increase over current spending. `` Let this be recorded as the time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> rose up and said, ` no' to drugs ... The war will be waged on all fronts.'' Borrowing a line from former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` To kids in our cities _ do n't give up hope. Say no to drugs. Stay in school. And yes, ` keep hope alive.''' In remarks addressed to his television audience `` watching tonight in your living rooms,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` hold fast to your dreams, because ultimately <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future rests in your hands.'' `` And to my friends in this chamber, I ask for your cooperation to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> growing while cutting the deficit. That is only fair to those who now have no vote _ the generations to come.'' His budget was vague on exactly where all the money would come from to pay for initiatives. MORE

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night to cut taxes on capital gains, whose benefits go primarily to people making more than $ 100,000 a year, and to enact a new tax break for low-income families. In a move that could be viewed as violating his `` no-new-taxes'' pledge, the president also recommended an extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone service, which is due to expire at the end of 1990, and to eliminate a scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets and cargo. He also proposed a $ 2-billion-a-year tax cut for corporate research costs; a Social Security tax increase of about the same size on 2 million employees of state and local governments; and new tax incentives for the oil industry and for parents who adopt. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his outline for `` Building a Better America,'' endorsed most of the miscellaneous revenue measures that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month. But the new president apparently abandoned a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal that would have had the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> charge taxpayers a fee when they call for advice on filling out their tax returns. By far the hottest issue in the revenue package is the proposal to cut the capital-gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added fuel to this long-running debate by claiming that his proposal would not cost the treasury a dime but would, in fact, raise more than $ 16 billion over the next five years, but lose $ 20.1 billion the following three years. `` Restoring the capital-gains differential will increase entrepreneurial activity and employment, paving the way for discoveries of new products, processes, and whole new industries,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, vowed all-out opposition to a capital-gains cut `` I'm not about to tell the wage earners in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that they should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I personally will strongly resist any efforts to undo -LRB- the 1986 -RRB- tax reform, including the return to a preferential tax rate for capital gains.'' Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock, real estate and other assets, traditionally were taxed at lower rates than wages and other income, under the assumption that most such investments are good for the economy. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> repealed that preferential treatment in 1986 as part of the price of reducing individual tax rates in the landmark tax overhaul. Thus, capital gains and wages now are taxed the same: at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed to phase in a new capital-gains preference that would produce a maximum rate of 15 percent on most gains; for those at the lower end of the income scale, the rate would be 8.25 percent. Coins, paintings and other collectibles would not qualify for the preference. In general, couples with incomes under $ 20,000 and single people under $ 10,000 would pay no tax on any qualified capital gain. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimates from returns filed in 1987 _ the last year for which complete figures are available _ show that taxable capital gains of $ 135 billion were reported on 12.9 million of the 103 million returns filed that year. More than one-third of that gain was recorded by only 34,818 taxpayers with incomes over $ 1 million a year. Their gain: $ 46.5 billion. The 1.15 million taxpayers with incomes over $ 100,000 had 70 percent _ $ 95 billion _ of the gain. About 3.7 million taxpayers with incomes under $ 20,000 had less than 7 percent of the gain. Other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revenue proposals: _ Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service, which otherwise would expire Dec. 31, 1990 This would cost taxpayers $ 6 billion in the following three years. _ Authorize a new tax credit of up to $ 1,000 a year for each child under age 4 in an estimated 2.5 million working families with incomes under $ 13,000 The credit, designed to assist with child-care expenses, would be available even if the family owes no tax. The family could choose between this credit and the existing dependent-care credit, which can be worth up to $ 1,440 a year. _ Require 2 million state and local government workers hired after March 31, 1986, to pay a tax for Medicare coverage Many already are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> because of a prior job or a working spouse. The tax, collected as part of the Social Security levy, is 1.45 percent of the first $ 48,000 of annual earnings. _ Retain the full federal tax on airline tickets, air cargo and aviation fuel A new law would cut them by half next year because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> contends the government is not spending the money quickly enough for airport and airway improvements. _ Give the oil and gas industry tax credits for the first $ 10 million of expenditures each year on such intangible oil-drilling expenses as labor and pipe, and for spending required to use sophisticated `` tertiary'' techniques to produce oil Rules that hinder the sale of proven oil properties to independent producers would be repealed. Independent producers would be allowed to deduct from the minimum tax 80 percent of certain exploratory intangible drilling costs. _ Permit a deduction of up to $ 3,000 for expenses of adopting a child with special needs, such as a physical handicap _ Make permanent a 20 percent credit for increased corporate spending for research, and permit international corporations to deduct 67 percent of total research spending against domestic income _ Give businesses $ 1 billion worth of tax incentives over four years for locating in economically distressed areas

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed Thursday to change the direction of the federal budget by moving money away from military growth and toward social progams that make up his vision of a kinder and gentler nation. The $ 1.16 trillion spending plan he sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would boost federal money in fiscal 1990 for cleaning up the environment, for AIDS research, for aid to the homeless and for education. `` This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our priorities, consistent with the people's view,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are many areas in which we would all like to spend more than I propose, but we can not until we get our fiscal house in order.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the president's budget director, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was making `` a very credible start'' toward the kinder, gentler society he has said repeatedly he wants. Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has signaled an end to the defense buildup and has indicated they're willing to flow some defense expenditures into meeting domestic needs like education. Overall, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan rests heavily on the foundation laid down by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget last month. He embraces <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for cost-cutting in entitlement programs, including $ 5 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and lesser amounts from farm price supports and federal employee benefits. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan would reject a few of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s least popular proposals, such as cutting the school lunch program and imposing a new fee for veterans' home loans, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> indicated. The vast majority of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget was carried over by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who as part of his no-growth `` flexible freeze'' policy, set a ceiling for these hundreds of programs roughly equal to what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to join him in shifting money between programs within this group so long as the totals still meet deficit-reduction goals. Among the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposals lumped into this group are terminations of 82 popular domestic programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s document allowed him to avoid specifically endorsing each one while still claiming the overall savings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed he met his pledge of no new general tax increase, but he did propose continuing two taxes that are scheduled to expire or decline _ the 3 percent federal tax on local and long distance telephone calls and the 8 percent tax on airline tickets. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget document says the federal deficit would be reduced to less than $ 91.1 billion next year, just slightly lower than the $ 92.5 billion in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal and within the $ 100 billion fiscal 1990 limit of the Gramm-Rudman law. The Bush White House estimates the deficit in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will be about $ 163.3 billion _ more than $ 2 billion higher than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was estimating just last month. The new president would trim back his predecessor's plan to increase military spending faster than the pace of inflation. Instead, military outlays of $ 298.2 billion this year would just keep up with inflation and increase to $ 300.3 billion. That would free $ 2.6 billion for other programs, compared to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed reducing the tax rate on capital gains to as low as 15 percent on productive assets held more than two years. That's less than half the current top capital gains rate He predicted that, rather than reducing federal revenues as many economics predict, this move would increase them by $ 4.8 billion because the rate cut would expand the economy and the tax base. Although many in the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> oppose the capital gains proposal as a break for the rich that would cost money in the long run, many favor some areas where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants to put the money. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was proposing to increase subsidies for energy development and scientific research, under the theme of international competitiveness. Among his proposals: _ More than $ 300 million in new tax breaks for the oil and gas industry; allowing new drilling in selected offshore areas and in the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> wildlife refuge _ Restoring a research and development tax credit for business _ Urban enterprise zones, using special tax breaks to lure companies to depressed areas _ Expanded support of research and science by endorsing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support for the space station and shuttle and the proposed superconducting super collider physics <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposes to spend the $ 515 million set aside by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to begin construction of the space station, to be in orbit in the late 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had put strings on the money by ordering that the new president must first approve its use. In seeking to make good on his campaign assertion that he is an environmentalist, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was promising more spending on the Superfund program for toxic waste cleanup, clean coal technology, clean water and wetlands programs, and a greater emphasis on global environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect. Selected domestic programs would be increased as part of his `` kinder, gentler nation'' theme, including: _ Increasing spending on the the Head Start preschool education program by $ 149 million _ A new merit award program for schools, increased subsidies for black colleges _ A renewed and expanded $ 3,000 tax deduction for adoption expenses _ Rejection of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed $ 1.7 billion cut in the Medicaid health program for the poor _ A child care tax credit of $ 1,000 for low-income families _ $ 21 million to start a national program for youth in public service. _ Increased spending for the battle against drug abuse, $ 236 million more than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget was released in a manner that discouraged comparisons with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposals. Instead, the president decided to compare his figures with those of the current fiscal year, a technique which makes his spending increases look larger because the old figures do n't factor in inflation. For example, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims as his initiatives a 13 percent boost in research to find a cure for the AIDS virus and a 19 percent increase in the space program. But his figures are the same as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget includes the $ 1.9 billion cost to taxpayers next year of his program to bail out the ailing savings and loan industry. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has proposed $ 2.1 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embraces <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan for upgrading aviation safety and adds $ 350 million to the $ 1.4 billion <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought for cleanups needed at the government's nuclear plants. He does not touch Social Security. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to reveal further details of his spending plans later this month, and the 193-page document released Thursday does not sell itself as a comprehensive budget. `` It represents the new administration's statement of priorities _ the outline of a blueprint for building a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' it says in its preface. The president's budget will be modified by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into a final budget resolution, which then serves as an overall guide for legislation.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For Action On Acid Rain, Other Environmental Issues</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on Thursday for quick action in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to combat acid rain and for a re-examination of off-shore oil drilling projects in several environmentally sensitive areas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, proposing his first budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he is committed to ending `` the long debate on acid rain'' by proposing legislation aimed at revising the Clean Air Act to significantly reduce industrial emissions that cause the problem. `` The time for action has come,'' declared the president's budget summary. `` If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the environment. We must protect the air we breathe,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a nationally televised address. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touched on other environmental issues that had been a frequent theme during his presidential campaign. `` We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund new acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund,'' he said. `` We must protect our oceans ... The age of the needle on the beach must end,'' he said, referring to hospital wastes that washed up on beaches in the Northeast last year. The proposed budget sks for $ 710 million _ nearly triple last year's amount _ in the next fiscal year to develop clean coal technology as part of the effort to deal with acid rain, which damages lakes and vegetation. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested some of the most important environmental issues go beyond national boundaries. To solve those problems, he announced he will convene an international conference to discuss such issues as global warming, ocean pollution and the loss of tropical rain forests. The budget also call for $ 191 million, a 43 percent increase, for research to examine the effects of pollutants on global warming through a so-called `` greenhouse'' effect. On off-shore oil drilling, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he remains committed to continuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases if they are `` prudent and environmentally sound.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> singled out three regions _ two off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast and one off the southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast _ where the administration plans to postpone lease sales pending reviews by a special task force that is to report to the president by Jan. 1, l990. The action is a break from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration which had sought to push ahead with the controversial leases despite objections of environmentalists and residents of the regions. The president said oil and gas lease sales covering 1.2 million acres off the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, which were scheduled for later this year, would be `` indefinitely postponed'' pending the environmental review, as would a lease sale off the southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. The sale of leases covering another 5 million acres off the southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, scheduled for l990, also would be reviewed. The action on the oil leases was immediately hailed by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., who said it `` demonstrates that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man of his word'' because he had promised review of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leases <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also promised to pursue an aggressive hazardous waste cleanup effort with increased emphasis on enforcement and action against those who dump wastes illegally. But the budget produced no additional funds for the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program beyond the $ 175 million increase outlined in the fiscal l990 budget submitted by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month. The Superfund program would receive $ 1.75 billion for the fiscal year. The budget called, however, for sharp increases in spending by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for cleanup and improved operations at the department's nuclear weapons plants. Cleanup costs at the plants for fiscal l990 were placed at $ 401 million, a 150 percent increase in spending over this year. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget also calls for: _ A commitment to halting ocean pollution. _ Establishment of a `` national goal'' to maintain the country's wetlands _ A promise to increase research into ways to reduce the growing volume of garbage.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday proposed to hold down the exploding <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending in fiscal year 1990 while offering Medicaid services to more poor women and children and increasing spending for AIDS research, the homeless and adoption services. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spending plan for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, runs close to the same course as the plan former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program would grow by $ 8 billion, to $ 92.5 billion next fiscal year, a 9.5 percent increase in a program that has grown an average of 15 percent per year for the past decade. The president's plan would save an estimated $ 5 billion in Medicare costs by limiting increases in payments to hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. It also would reduce payments to hospitals for new construction and supplemental payments to teaching hospitals. For Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> restored <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed $ 1.7 billion cutback and added $ 3.3 billion to maintain the level of current services under the program. The increase would boost spending 9.7 percent from the current $ 34.3 billion to $ 37.6 billion. Costs of the Medicaid and Medicare programs are among the fastest growing segments of the federal budget because health care costs have been increasing far faster than the general inflation rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> abandoned <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal to cut Medicaid payments to the states. But he proposed to require states to raise mandatory Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children to 30 percent higher than the poverty level, up from the poverty level, and to offset the expansion with cuts in administrative expenses. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissenbaum </PERSON> of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group that researches policy issues affecting the low-income, said the proposed Medicaid policies would shift the financial burden to the states. `` States, which administer Medicaid, would end up having to make other cuts in Medicaid protection for poor children and their families in order to finance <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Medicaid expansions, unless states were willing to pump significantly more money of their own into the program,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also wants $ 20 million in fiscal years 1990 and 1991 for grants to states with high infant mortality to develop health and nutrition programs to combat the problem. The president proposed no cuts in Social Security, which will cost $ 260 billion in 1990. In January 1990, recipients _ about 39.5 million people, some 650,000 more than this year _ would receive a cost-of-living increase estimated at 3.6 percent. Spending on AIDS research and educational programs would rise 13 percent to $ 1.4 billion next year. The president also said a national AIDS program will be established in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate and consolidate AIDS funding, which is now spread among 23 separate PHS agencies and `` vulnerable to bureaucratic competition and rivalries.'' Almost 85,000 Americans have been diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome since June 1981, and more than half, or almost 48,600, have died. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said reported cases of the fatal disease in this country are expected to reach 365,000 by the end of 1992 _ with 80,000 new cases and 65,000 deaths projected for that year alone. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also addressed his campaign commitment to `` adoption not abortion'' by proposing a $ 10 million increase in spending on adoption services, which would raise funding 7.8 percent to $ 138 million. In addition, the president proposed a tax deduction of up to $ 3,000 to cover adoption costs that are not reimbursed through other programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also wants to raise spending for the homeless by 29 percent, from $ 500 million currently to $ 645 million next year. As part of the increase, he proposed a $ 50 million program to help homeless families move from welfare hotels to transitional or permanent homes and provide services and shelter for the homeless mentally ill.
