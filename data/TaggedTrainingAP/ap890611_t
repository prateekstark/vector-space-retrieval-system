 A small commercial plane with 20 people aboard made an emergency landing near the Venezuelan border during a storm Sunday, killing four people and injuring 12, the government said. The plane, a Canadian-built Twin Otter operated by the private domestic company <PERSON> Aerotaca </PERSON>, landed on a bank of the <LOCATION> Casanara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> because of a driving rain, said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The report did not say what damage the plane suffered or how the four people died, and it did not give the breakdown of passengers and crew. A press report said all people aboard the twin-engine plane were Colombian. Among the passengers were Colombian folk singer and composer <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Briceno </PERSON> as well as reporters and television cameramen invited by the state-owned company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> to retrace the route taken by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> during the final battles on Colombian independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> 170 years ago, said an agency spokesman. The names of the other passengers and crew were were not immediately available and it was not known whether <PERSON> Briceno </PERSON> was among the victims. The plane was flying between <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and Tame, an oil town 220 miles east of the capital, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A company source said the pilot reported the plane could not land in Tame because of the heavy rain and was fly on to <LOCATION> Bucaramang </LOCATION>, the largest city in eastern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Authorities declared the plane missing when it failed to reach its destination. Some Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> units searched for the plane, but it was not immediately clear who spotted the aircraft.

<HEAD>Seven Overcome by Carbon Monoxide at Ice Rink Released From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven people hospitalized after being overcome by carbon monoxide in an ice skating rink were released Saturday, and special precautions were taken to avoid more problems. The seven were among 25 people sickened by gas emitted from an ice grooming machine, known as a Zamboni, during a hockey tournament at the rink Friday. The others were treated with oxygen at the scene. A faulty exhaust system on the Zamboni apparently caused it to emit the carbon monoxide, which stayed close to the ice, said <ORGANIZATION> Tualatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Nodland </PERSON>. He said the carbon monoxide readings in the arena were at safe levels Saturday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> general manager, said large fans were set up Saturday to circulate air at the rink and the ice grooming machine was fitted with a catalytic converter to reduce its emissions. He theorized that extra refrigeration used to keep the ice solid in recent warm weather brought the temperature so low in the arena Friday that carbon monoxide from the Zamboni stayed near the ice and would n't disperse normally. This was the second year in a row that carbon monoxide poisoning has occurred at the rink during a hockey game for the Rose Festival, the city's annual June festival. Paramedics were first alerted to the problems at the rink Friday night when a parent sought aid for a child that was vomiting. Several children complained of dizziness and nausea, and at least one child fainted. Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorts </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said one boy brought there Friday night was treated for 90 minutes in a glass-enclosed, pressurized chamber, where pure oxygen was pumped into the boy's lungs Because of the relatively low levels of the carbon monoxide in Friday's incident, <PERSON> Lorts </PERSON> said, it is unlikely that any person at the rink would suffer long-term ill effects. Carbon monoxide is odorless, tasteless and colorless and is produced during combustion. Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> Tualatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>'s hazardous-materials team at the rink, said initial readings of carbon monoxide in the building were 120 to 170 parts per million of air He said 50 parts per million was considered the maximum concentration before people felt sick, and 1,500 parts per million would be lethal.

 Police on Saturday arrested nearly 600 abortion opponents who tried to blockade clinics around the nation, including one in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> disrupted by shouting and shoving matches between protesters and abortion rights advocates. Protests also took place in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Police arrested 250 of the approximately 500 members of the national anti-abortion group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> who staged a sit-in that blocked doors to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said Police Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plourde </PERSON> The demonstrators, who prayed and sang hymns, were far outnumbered by about 1,000 chanting abortion rights advocates led by organizers using bullhorns. `` This is disgusting! This is a baby!'' <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> shouted as she thrust a picture of a fetus at counterdemonstrators. `` This woman's ignorance is the mass ignorance of her movement!'' an abortion rights advocate yelled from the crowd, apparently referring to the debate over when life begins. The ill will prompted pushing and shoving as well as angry shouting matches before about 300 police, including several on horseback, moved in. It took them about three hours to clear the sidewalk in front of the clinic, which offers pregnancy counseling, family planning advice and abortions. `` It's a little bit scary today, there's a lot more fighting,'' said Operation Rescue spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>. `` Our people are willing to be beaten or arrested to save the lives of the babies.'' Among those arrested was Operation Rescue national field director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuirk </PERSON>, another group spokesman. The protest was the latest in a series by Operation Rescue as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> considers a challenge to the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortion. Among the abortion rights advocates at the rally were <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, who was `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>'' in the high court's landmark 1973 ruling, and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> and past president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orgniazation </ORGANIZATION> for Women `` Rescue the homeless; rescue the many thousands of hungry people and children that are already here today,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> said outside the clinic in a message to the protesters. `` Think not about the women who choose to have the right to control their own bodies and destinies. You can not choose their destinies for them.'' Those arrested were booked on trespassing charges, and many refused to post $ 500 bail or to identify themselves, <PERSON> Plourde </PERSON> said. Without positive identification, detainees can not be released on their own recognizance. `` Our standard policy is, ` Do n't post bail,''' <PERSON> McGuirk </PERSON> said. `` Do n't accept probation or plea bargaining. Everyone stays -LRB- in jail -RRB- until they all get out.'' In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, police arrested all but 10 of the 150 anti-abortion protesters who blocked the doors to the Northeast Women's Center. Protesters surrounded woman trying to enter, said clinic acting director <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>. `` Several women left very upset, in tears, crying and in stress,'' she said. `` Their health has been endangered.'' The protest organized by the Pro-Life Non-Violent Action Project of <LOCATION> Southeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> came three months after a federal judge issued a permanent injunction against disruptive abortion demonstrations in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newcomer </PERSON>'s order includes a $ 5,000 fine for each violation. The center will return to court to accuse the protesters of violating the injunction, said <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, said the protesters `` do n't let injunctions keep them from saving lives.'' The center also was involved in a case considered the first in the nation accusing protesters of violating anti-racketeering laws. Last March, the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a jury verdict against 27 leaders of the Philadelphia-area movement. The leaders and Operation Rescue have been been fined about $ 110,000 in the case, which has been appealed. In <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, about 90 of the 225 anti-abortion protesters who turned out at <ORGANIZATION> Affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a downtown clinic, were arrested, police said. Officers had to carry away many, who sat down and refused to move. Nearly 40 abortion rights advocates staged a counterdemonstration across the street. In <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, police arrested 63 of the 100 to 200 protesters who turned out a Planned Parenthood clinic, said Lt. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>. The protesters, who were arrested on trespassing charges, were released after giving officers their names, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, police arrested about 45 anti-abortion demonstrators who were blocking entrances to a clinic. Police Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the protesters were charged with obstructing public passage to a building. `` They come and picket a lot, but this is the largest number of arrests,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 Two men identified as Chinese Consulate diplomats announced they can no longer support their government and said they were defecting at a vigil on Saturday for students slain in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. To the amazement and delight of 5,000 people gathered in front of City Hall, the duo mounted a stage and said that as Chinese nationals and as human beings they could no longer go along with a government whose troops fired on unarmed students. Both men were then taken to the nearby offices of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said a policeman, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. They had called the bureau before the announcement, said K.K. Woo, one of the rally organizers. The two announced their intention to request political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed. A Chinese Consulate spokesman said he had not heard about the men's statements and had no information. The men announced their action at a rally where a largely <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> crowd, including some crying and many wearing black arm bands, carried candles and makeshift banners reading `` Their blood, Our tears.'' The crowd cheered when the announcement was made, <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> said. Rally organizers, reading from the men's Chinese business cards, identified the speakers as <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-ming </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-mun </PERSON>. But they said they were unsure of the proper English transliteration. One of the diplomats told a local television station he was optimistic about the future of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s prodemocracy movement despite the government's political crackdown. `` I think their victory is only temporary. The people will win,'' the man, who was not identified, told television station <ORGANIZATION> KTVU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. The station said one of the men was the vice consul and the other either the consulate's information officer or cultural affairs officer. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would release no information about the men.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military Sunday lifted a weeklong curfew that confined 700,000 Palestinians to their homes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, ending one of the longest restrictions imposed in the 18-month Arab uprising. Also Sunday, 15-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaweeshin </PERSON> died of a gunshot wound in the head suffered in a clash with soldiers Saturday in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. An eight-year-old boy also was killed in the stone-throwing confrontation. Officials at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, where the teen-ager was taken for treatment, declined immediate comment.

Twenty-two Israelis have died in the violence. Some 4,000 cars carrying Palestinians left <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> after the curfew was lifted to take workers to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. But the restriction remained in <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> camp, where 53,000 Palestinians had to stay home. The military imposed the curfew June 4 to control the population by issuing identity cards that workers will have to show to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>, 150 peace activists demonstrated Sunday against the town's plan to require that Arab day laborers wait in a specially designated `` transit station'' on the outskirts. The activists say the plan, to keep Arabs out of the town center, is racist. Police have challenging the legality of the station. Its planned opening Sunday was delayed as town councilors debated. Eight Israeli peace activists who met with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representatives in June 1987 were charged Sunday in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court with violating anti-terror laws. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terror organization and bans citizens from meeting with the group. The activists were led by <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Biton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator who was not charged because he has parliamentary immunity.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s first state visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is overshadowed by tragedy and unrest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and an accelerating threat worldwide to the socialist ideology that guides his leadership. But the Soviet president's advance men have been deftly deflecting the distractions, hinting that major initiatives may be in the making during the much-publicized summit. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day visit, which begins Monday, comes with high expectations on both sides. Each speaks of a new era in relations and a historic chance for closing the gap between East and West. Both nations are focusing on the opportunities presented by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, relegating to the sidelines the reform-related crises in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and among ethnic groups within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We consider this an extremely important meeting, perhaps the most important one we've had in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the Soviet government spokesman, said in an interview on Friday. Acknowledging West Germans' enthusiasm for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader and his reform program, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wanted a close look at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and would go out and `` press the flesh.'' Asked if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> planned to respond to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arms control initiative announced May 29 during the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` There is no ground for a quick reply.'' He said the conventional weapons reduction plan outlined by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and endorsed by the Western allies has not been formally presented to negotiators at superpower talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, so an official <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> response was unlikely. But he said another Soviet step in the disarmament volley was `` possible'' during the summit that opens Monday. Another member of the Soviet advance delegation, political observer <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezymensky </PERSON> of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Friday that `` we should let ourselves be surprised'' by what takes place during the summit. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a West German government spokesman, sees the visit as a chance to reach a goal of `` peace with ever fewer weapons.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> predicted `` a milestone in German-Soviet relations.'' The atmosphere of hope, however, has been tainted by numerous domestic troubles likely to continue boiling while the Soviet leader is abroad. Ethnic unrest in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> reportedly prompted some last-minute schedule changes to allow <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to stay in close contact with the Kremlin throughout his visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies finally ended its stormy inaugural session Friday. The lawmakers' struggle to redefine the nation's course for democracy and their sharp criticism of the Communist Party amazed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, who watched on television, and preoccupied the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. Soviets are in mourning over the hundreds of deaths resulting from a train disaster in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> June 3, and the advance delegation indicated <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would not be attending a gala concert in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Wednesday so as to maintain an appropriately somber atmosphere. But the hosts' eagerness to give the summit the highest profile appears to have won out. `` The Germans have done a very clever thing,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON>, another senior <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to prepare the summit. `` They have now made it a concert to benefit the victims of the train tragedy, so we will have to reconsider.'' Both sides have pinned high hopes on the visit and its potential to maintain good momentum in improving relations between East and West. West Germans have embraced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for `` a common European home,'' an aim they see as an opportunity to let the barriers fall between East and <PERSON> West </PERSON> and perhaps lead to an eventual reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The conservative <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> reported two weeks ago that the West German government `` expects that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will stress the German right of self-determination in some form or another when he visits <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' That would soften the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional view that reunification could take place only under a socialist leadership. Soviet officials have indicated such a gesture is possible, but they have given no clues as to what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might say on that subject, or in response to persistent questions about the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall erected by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1961. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, visited <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Friday for talks with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> described his visit with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> as a matter of protocol prior to the state visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but the minister declined to specify what matters would be discussed at the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summit. The visit is likely to provide a boost to the standing of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was rated as the most popular foreign statesman ever in a poll released a week ago by the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>, outdistancing even <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit may help <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party in next week's European Parliament elections. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> and a specialist in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs, predicted that the summit would focus on atmosphere rather than substance, mostly because of the sensitive stage in which the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader finds himself. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said problems with socialism as an ideology began escalating with the Polish Solidarity movement in 1980 and lately have `` been accelerating at an unbelievable pace, a pace that is really staggering and frightening.''

 Government soldiers killed 44 rebel fighters during a battle in the southern province of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the national news agency AIM reported Sunday. The rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> were killed while attempting to attack a military training center Friday in the town of <LOCATION> Machubane </LOCATION>, AIM said, citing a statement by Col. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulele </PERSON>. Machubane is about 120 miles northeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. The report gave no additional details and made no mention of government troop casualties. Information on the fighting is often sketchy and can take days or even weeks to reach <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Replica Of Henry Hudson's Ship Christened At Albany Dock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly four centuries after explorer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s crew mutinied and set him adrift, a replica of his ship has been launched to honor the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' contributions to the New World. `` What the sea separates, the shipbuilder unites,'' ship designer <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> told a crowd of about 500 Saturday before the christening of the Half Moon. The 85-foot, 120-ton wooden vessel was lowered by crane into the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> discovered in 1609 during his search for a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> passage to the Orient. Two years later, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s crew mutinied, setting him, his young son and seven others adrift in a small boat in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. They were never seen again. The replica was conceived by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, a dermatologist who plans to use the Half Moon as a platform to give history lessons on Dutch contributions. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> himself was born in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> but was working for the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> at the time he found the river that bears his name. There's a `` historical blind spot'' that keeps historians from considering Dutch contributions to the New World, <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> said. That's partly because the English ousted the Dutch from their early stronghold in the New World in the 1600s, he said. The Dutch first settled the area between English colonies in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, the nation's oldest incorporated city, he said. The ship will spend the summer touring the states once called the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. At the christening, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> Consul General <PERSON> Adrien </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieleman </PERSON> said the Dutch have always been proud of their `` small contribution to the mightiest, most free and prosperous nation in the world.'' The Half Moon replica cost about $ 1 million, raised mostly through donations, and took a year to build. The builders are applying finishing touches and the ship's maiden voyage is scheduled for July 5. About 25 people worked to build the square-rigged ship, which will be outfitted with replicas of 17th century cannons, said shipwright <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mayville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Sailmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, hand-sewed the ship's nine sails. About 600 man-hours went into the sails, made of synthetics treated to look like canvas sails of the 1600s, he said. Because ships four centuries ago were built for cargo, the squat Half Moon wo n't win any races, <PERSON> Bierig </PERSON> said. `` It will be on the slow side,'' he said. `` Sailors were cheap and in those days there was no reason you needed speed.''

<TEXT>
 The Communist Chinese propaganda machine is working at a frenzied pace to portray the bloody military occupation of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as a heroic operation against `` counter-revolutionaries.'' The saturation campaign serves to shield the government from blame for the June 4 massacre in which hundreds, perhaps thousands of people died when soldiers fired at unarmed citizens supporting a movement for a freer society. Word of the assault on the pro-democracy movement quickly spread to several large <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities, where huge crowds took to the streets to demand the fall of conservative leaders who ordered the military attack. But hardliners such as senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> have kept their grip on power, supporting their position with the propaganda barrage. The main vehicle for the campaign has been nationwide television. After a few days of virtual silence on the attack, television began showing grainy black-and-white tapes of angry crowds attacking soldiers and torching military vehicles. Color videotapes of similar scenes soon appeared, often shown dozens of times over several days. Soldiers indiscriminately firing at crowds or crushing people with armored vehicles were not shown. Neither were scenes of hospitals filled with the dead and the injured from the withering attack on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. The videotapes often did not have sound, perhaps so the audience could not hear the gunfire or the angry chants of `` fascists'' directed at the soldiers. The official theme of soldiers as victims soon was expanded, with television showing injured troops lying in hospital beds. In one particularly gruesome scene, an evening newscast showed the charred bodies of three soldiers burned to death, including one who was disemboweled. The campaign also stresses the theme of soldiers as friends. Under guard of rifle-toting soldiers, propaganda trucks with signs reading `` the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> loves the people'' rolled down <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main streets with loudspeakers blaring Scenes of soldiers and citizens helping one another have dominated television, which in recent days have devoted several hours of special newscasts daily to present the government line. On Saturday, television showed a peasant bringing three huge pigs to applauding soldiers. The next day's evening newscast showed troops at an elementary school playing with children and helping them clean their classrooms. The newest phase of the propaganda onslaught has shown dozens of `` scoundrels'' and `` counterrevolutionaries'' under arrest on charges of participating in the demonstrations. Television has shown them questioned at gunpoint and signing confessions. Chinese media also has attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which has provided millions of Chinese with an independent account of the weekend bloodbath. In another attempt to quell non-official accounts, television Saturday urged viewers to turn in a `` rumor-monger'' who was shown giving a bloody account of the attack. On Sunday, the evening news reported his capture and the man was shown expressing remorse to security officials. Television interviews with citizens applauding the military action increased during the weekend. `` It gave use great satisfaction to see the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> go into the city and put down the turmoil,'' said one man. Several people who were interviewed said they were shocked by the attacks on soldiers seen on television. `` I was greatly pained to see <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> soldiers burned to death and beaten to death,'' primary school teacher <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON> told a television reporter. Many Chinese are skeptical of the state-controlled media so it is impossible to know how many people find the propaganda campaign convincing. `` Not a single person will believe it,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who claimed he saw more than 10 people shot in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> by soldiers early June 4. But some Chinese who did not see the weekend events themselves could find the relentless television accounts persuasive. `` In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, people know what happened. But those on the outside do not,'' said another <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. `` Most Chinese are peasants. They believe what the government says.''

 Inmates being driven from one jail to another smilingly showed the officer guarding them their new discovery: that their seat belts made handy tools for breaking handcuffs. The sheriff's office and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> did n't smile, though, and are warning officers nationwide of the technique. `` There is danger to every law enforcement officer in the country,'' said <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Ten prisoners learned the seat belt trick while being taken from the downtown jail to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> jail, and before the ride was over all were free, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Saturday. `` When the deputy opened the back of the van, all 10 guys were smiling and said ` See what we did,''' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, adding that each prisoner held up his arms to show broken handcuffs. The cuffs that go around each wrist are connected by a chain, attached to each cuff by a swivel that moves freely to ensure that the chain does n't twist. Seat belt clips have one or two holes or slots, that lock them into place with the buckle. The prisoners learned that jamming the swivel link through a hole on the clip stops the swivel from turning freely. `` A quick twist of the wrist, and the chain shears off at the cuff,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The prank led <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities to issue emergency bulletins to law enforcement agencies across the state Friday. Similar warnings also would be given nationwide, the sheriff said, and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said an advisory would be placed in the agency's Law Enforcement Bulletin. `` Although only 10 people know the technique, I guarantee that the entire jail population, all 690 of them, will know how to do it before the day is up,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The only people who wo n't know about it is law enforcement officers.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> ordered seat belts removed from jail vans. He also ordered that prisoners in police cars be cuffed with their hands behind their backs and that the seat belts be locked firmly across them. Handcuff manufacturers were contacted Friday and are studying ways of redesigning the handcuffs, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The 10 inmates who revealed their discovery may regret the caper. The sheriff was not amused. `` Charge them with destruction of county property,'' he told deputies. `` We'll see how funny they think that is.''

<HEAD>Bush Putting Final Touches on Environmental Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked on the final details Sunday of a package of proposals aimed at cleaning up the nation's air by imposing sharp cuts in acid rain pollutants and reducing the smog that plagues most cities The proposals, to be unveiled at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, represent the first time in nearly a decade that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has joined in an effort to overhaul federal air quality laws. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to send clean air legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during his eight years in office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a conservation group last week his proposals would represent `` sweeping changes'' in federal air pollution laws and `` significantly improve every North American's quality of life'' whether they live near industrial plants or in the woodland countryside. Environmentalists say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air package is his severest test so far on whether he plans to make good on campaign promises to take environmental issues seriously. While details of the president's proposals are not yet clear, government and congressional sources said the plan is expected to include: _ Requirements for cutting sulfur dioxide emissions, mostly from older coal-burning electric power plants by 10 million tons by the year 2000 to combat acid rain, which has been blamed for destroying lakes, streams and forests. _ A requirement for industry to install control technology to curb the release of cancer-causing and other toxic chemicals from such facilities as chemical plants and oil refineries. It also is likely to streamline the way the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> regulates such chemicals, allowing them to set standards by broad category rather than chemical by chemical. _ Reductions in smog-causing pollutants from automobiles through a combination of pollution controls and a limited shift to alternative, cleaner fuels instead of gasoline. The urban smog problem, largely caused by automobile pollutants, has been among the thorniest issues facing the administration. Some members of the administration have favored requiring specific curbs to reduce ozone-causing pollutants, while others have favored broader flexibility that would allow the oil and automobile industries to work out how best to meet government-imposed targets. Even though the president's proposals were expected to fall short of what some environmentalists sought, they welcomed his administration's willingness to get involved in efforts to update the 1970 Clean Air Act. Congressional leaders have said that they expect revisions to be enacted by this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, although probably not until next year. Legislation already has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to require stringent reductions in pollutants _ primarily hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide from motor vehicles _ that cause ozone pollution which in turn is a key component of smog. Other bills already being considered would require the `` best available technology'' to be enlisted to curb toxic chemical emissions into the air by industry and establish specific benchmarks for cutting acid rain pollutants. The president's proposal was expected to be less demanding of industry than some of the legislation already before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Environmentalists, for example, have sought a reduction in sulfur dioxide from power plants of at least 12 million tons over the next decade and have argued for tightening of automobile tailpipe emission controls to fight urban pollution. The utility industry has called those actions too expensive and some in the administration, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and the presidents <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, have agreed. During a meeting with the president last week on the clean air proposals, industry representatives pleaded that the proposals not be too costly. `` We urged that when the dust settles on clean air, that we have a healthy economy left,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a business coalition. After a later meeting attended by environmentalists, the president was told that pollution itself also is costly as well as being pervasive. To make the point they provided a chart showing that during a week last summer the air in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where the president has a vacation retreat, had ozone concentrates that were `` unhealthy'' by federal definition on two of the seven days. `` He sat there and said, ` I'm not safe anywhere,' and we said, ` Yes, and its worse in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,''' recalled <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON>, one of the environmentalists at the meeting.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet defector has been telling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agencies some of the inner secrets of a little understood Kremlin body that plays a key role in charting Soviet foreign policy. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has shifted course, loosening its ties with Marxist parties in the West and cultivating relations with other less radical elements, said the defector, <PERSON> Evgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> started to promote the principles of his ` new thinking,' to find new clients, sometimes at the expense of old clients, to find parties and groups that have influence in capitalist countries,'' <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The new approach has brought closer Soviet ties to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Western European environmental and peace groups that agree with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s approach to disarmament and attempts to lessen international tension, said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>. Because his work in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> centered on Arab and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> declined to speculate on which Western groups were sympathetic to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new approach. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials, who said they were not familar with the specifics of <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>'s case, confirmed that <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>'s description met their understanding of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> They said most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Western European groups were sophisticated enough to remain independent even while developing contacts with Soviet officials known to be linked to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The International Department, for which <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> worked from 1970 until his defection last year, was the successor to the Comintern, or Communist International, or later the Cominform, disbanded by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1947. The Comintern was the main organ of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> influence on communist parties outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a means of molding political platforms and sometimes recruiting intelligence agents, according to numerous accounts by defectors. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shares with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> responsibility for formulating Soviet foreign policy, which is decided by the ruling Politburo, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> carries out state-to-state contacts, while the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> handles party-to-party matters. Senior International Department experts are driven in chauffeured cars, receive salaries equal to those of deputy ministers and have access to intelligence reports from the ministries of defense and foreign affairs, and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> said in a paper prepared for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Shortly after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose to power in March 1985, he tried to gain control of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and change its inner workings by appointing as its chief <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, who had served as the Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since the 1960s. `` <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, however, was very much an outsider'' to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucracy, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> said. Thus <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>'s reform attempts foundered, forcing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to move him from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION> into a newly created post as adviser. `` The old timers in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opposed <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>. `` The old cadres sabotaged Dobryinin.'' Last fall, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reorganized the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION>, naming his right-hand man, <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, as head of a newly created <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The new head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Before the reorganization, said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, many of the senior officials in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dated back to the days of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Suslov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>, two Stalinist holdovers who served under the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> lectured from 1970 to 1985 in the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which he described as a secret school run by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. His job was to conduct seminars in political philosophy for small groups of students from Marxist parties in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and for two radical Palestinian groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the Peoples Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Professors at the institute drew up classified reports on those movements, based in part on what the students said in class. `` For example, I made a study of the <ORGANIZATION> Yemeni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its origins, history, influence of Marxism, influence of Islam, influence on the masses,'' said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>. From 1985 until his defection, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> was chief of the Arabic editorial office of the World Marxist Review in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Arabic versions of the magazine `` were printed mostly in Western countries, and distributed in various Arab countries under titles very different from the original. `` The goal was to pretend it was a national magazine, produced in each nation, but 70-100 percent of it was prepared in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> ... under directions from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>. `` Nowhere did it say it was printed in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Big Bucks Likely to Characterize Races for Pepper, Wright, Coelho

 Millions of dollars of special interest money is expected to prime the political pumps as Republicans battle for three historically <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> seats in races spawned by the congressional ethics wars and the death of <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. `` You're going to see candidates in all of these races spending a good deal of time trying to squeeze money out of the lobbyists, and there's no doubt that millions of dollars special interest funds will pour in,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a citizens group based here. The stakes are not momentous, since Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 259 to 175, and even a Republican sweep would not change things much. For that matter, registered Democrats predominate in all three districts. But Republicans lost face in April with special-election defeats in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, even though they held on in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. They want to avenge those losses in the upcoming round. Democrats, on the other hand, want to avoid the embarrassment of an upset. The three districts are: _ The 12th District of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, taking in much of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has represented it since 1955, stepped down as House Speaker on May 31 at the end of a yearlong ethics probe and is expected to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> itself by the end of the month. _ The 15th District of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, in the rich cotton, fruit and vegetable-growing <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the nation's premier center of agribusiness House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who represented the district since 1979, announced on May 27 that he would resign to head off a protracted controversy over a $ 100,000 `` junk bond'' purchase. _ The 18th <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, taking in much of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> Rules Chairman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> died May 30 after representing the district since 1962. There is no denying that the races will cost a bundle. `` We're talking about $ 500,000 at this point, but if we have to go higher, I guess we can,'' says <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>, already an announced candidate. `` But I want to earn this race, I do n't want to buy it.'' Candidates in April's <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> race spent $ 500,000 each as did contestants in a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> election where Republicans eked out victory on April 29. Need for money and lack of time most likely will send the new set of candidates scurrying to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbies that have plenty of ready cash as well as long legislative shopping lists. `` I would think that the Democrats would do what they've done already, which is to organize labor union political action committees to turn on the spigot, and Republicans will do what we can to reach out to the business PACs to help raise money for Republicans,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> already is putting out word that he backs <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>, 37, a former <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> staffer, is unlikely to announce, however, until after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> leaves or at least sets a specific date for his departure. Other Democrats being mentioned as possible contenders include state Sen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> and former state Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Millsap </PERSON> as well as Fort Worth Councilman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>. Republicans include state Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, television health show host Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, airport board member <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> county Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and county Judge <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, who switched to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> at a heavily ballyhooed White House ceremony in 1986. Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, candidates from both parties slug it out in a single special election, with a runoff between the two top vote getters if no one gains a majority. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Democratic state Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON> is also campaigning. <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, 41, is a member of the `` Gang of Five,'' conservative Democrats who warred with liberal Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in 1988. `` I was stripped of all my committee assignments and had my office moved about once a month,'' <PERSON> Condit </PERSON> chortles. The antics helped <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>. `` Fighting with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did n't hurt him at all because fighting with a liberal in that district is what you want to do,'' says <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Water availability and quality loom as crucial issues in district, where farmers are also irked by pollution damage to crops from autos of increasingly numerous commuters to <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> jobs. Both candidates vow to shun negative campaigning. <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON> does say, however, that `` my opponent already has been involved in special interest politics in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, frankly, is not a whole lot better than <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. I'm glad I was n't there.'' Only one other Democrat has been mentioned as a possible contender: state Rep. <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Areias </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> D-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banos </ORGANIZATION>, another `` Gang of Five'' member. Republicans include <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chairman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating-Edh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Daran </PERSON> <PERSON> Koligian </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaforian </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and highly decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterakis </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, candidates of both parties are lumped in one race. If no one gains a majority, the top Republican fights the leading Democrat in a runoff. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> election, set for Aug. 29, puts the spotlight on the sizeable Cuban-American community in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. Pepper won their hearts with TV ads in Spanish and firm backing for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels while cementing ties with just about every other ethnic group in one way or another. In 1988, the 88-year-old lawmaker ran without opposition. Battle lines are drawn again, however, with two Cuban-Americans already in the race on the Republican side, state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> and millionaire banana importer <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a prominent supporter of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Among Democrats, state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Claude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION> business partner who plans to get in the race this week, acknowledges that his stand against <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> aid could be vexing. `` As a matter of fact, the right-wing Cubans threw rocks and eggs at me'' at an anti-Contra demonstration, he says. He says he has a strategy to counteract the problem that he will reveal this week. `` I think the chances are pretty good for a Cuban-American to be elected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> strategist <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON>. Already announced among Republicans are state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> and millionaire banana importer <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a high-profile supporter of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Also mentioned as a possible contenders was GOP state Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>. Democrats include <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> Commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersten </PERSON>, State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and former school board chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cejas </PERSON>.

<HEAD>U.S. Doctors Arrive to Treat Gas Blast Victims; More Than 400 Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American burn experts flew to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> on Sunday to treat hundreds of victims of a huge gas explosion that engulfed two trains in flames. Official media said more than 400 people have now died in the tragedy. Authorities said the death toll likely would climb, especially if severely burned patients do not receive immediate treatment. `` We are close to the most critical stage for patients,'' <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation Health Minister <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Potapov </PERSON> told the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said only 32 of the 805 people hospitalized following the June 4 blast had recovered sufficiently to be discharged while another 114, including 28 children, had died. At the site of the huge explosion along the <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Siberian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, 308 bodies, including the remains of 67 children, have been found to date, the paper said. `` These are terrifying figures, but they are not final,'' it said. Just one search party in which passengers' relatives took part located the remains of three more victims Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Previously, state-run media had said more than 190 of the approximately 1,200 passengers aboard the trains were killed when a spark from the railway's electrical line ignited a highly flammable mixture of benzine and propane-butane gas that leaked from a pipeline about a half mile away. The trains, traveling in opposite directions between <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Novosibirsk </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort city of <LOCATION> Adler </LOCATION>, had made unscheduled stops in the valley in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> One train was carrying schoolchildren to vacation camps in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The blast had the force of 10,000 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, half as strong as the A-bomb that fell on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, said Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>, chief of the Soviet military's general staff. But its true human costs are only now becoming apparent. A government commission looking into the accident, which occurred 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, concluded Sunday that `` the dimensions of the June 3-4 railway tragedy are much broader than supposed before,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported from the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>. The commission said the number of passengers aboard the two trains was greater than originally believed, but that even now it is `` impossible to cite excat numbers. `` Night and day in the hospitals of <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>, the fight continues for the lives of the injured,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> added. A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medics flew into <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION> on Sunday and headed straight for the city's hospitals to begin helping accident victims, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. All the doctors are specialists in treating burns, and the group brought its own drugs and equipment, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The 17-member team from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, stopped Saturday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on its way to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The group's leader, Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, said the medics expected to remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for up to 10 days. `` What we've been told is that there are more than 100 children with serious burns and in addition to that, there are an unknown number of adults with significant burns,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. He said the group, responding to a request for aid from the Soviets, was bringing 18,000 pounds of medical supplies on its giant C-141 transport plane, as well as three Russian-language translators and two administrative officers. State-run television reported last week that 50 percent of the injured suffered burns over more than 70 percent of their bodies. Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> says Soviet doctors lack experience in treating such severe burns, and the Soviets appealed for advice and urgent airlifts of equipment from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials have charged that workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in pressure caused by the leak but increased pressure instead of shutting the line down. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> the Soviet secret police sent a team of investigators to the accident site to learn what had happened.

<HEAD>East German Welcomes Bush Arms Plan, Cites New Berlin Wall Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the East German government says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a reduction in conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is a welcome step that is in tune with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact desires for speedy negotiations, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in its Sunday edition as confirming that East German border guards have been ordered not to use deadly force to stop civilians who attempt to flee into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> unless the soldiers are threatened themselves. In a two-hour interview conducted last Wednesday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted the influential <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> leader as saying the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> nations to cut conventional arms is `` close to our striving for radical conventional disarmament.'' Questioned on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call to `` lock in'' reductions in tanks, artillery, armed personnel carriers and other non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> during a 23-nation negotiation on Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the paper quoted <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> as replying: `` We are interested in having those proposals included in the negotiations, so that we can identify where the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty states concur -LRB- with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and those areas where more intensive negotiations are needed.'' As to nuclear arms, he said, `` We are in favor of the step-by-step elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Of course we know that this ca n't be done in one stroke.'' He raised the possibility that each side might decide to `` keep, say, 10'' weapons. `` One has to enter negotiations and see what progress can be achieved,'' said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who is head of state and general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes surprises even occur.'' He rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to be torn down, but said his government wants `` to humanize the border regime'' as part of generally improving relations with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said East German border guards are authorized to shoot people trying to flee the country only if the guards are in physical danger or if a soldier or other uniformed person is trying to desert. He did not say when the restrictions took effect, but Western officials have said the policy apparently was adopted as a goodwill gesture prior to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1987. Although 190 people have died trying to flee <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the wall was built in 1961, there has been only one confirmed case since the 1987 <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

 The government has moved to silence three top dissidents who share a passion for democracy: an internationally known astrophysicist, his college professor wife and a shaggy-haired accountant. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued an arrest warrant for astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, who are hiding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted Chinese sources as saying another dissident, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON>, was arrested late Saturday. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, 53, is the most prominent dissident in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 on charges of having helped provoke an earlier series of student pro-democracy demonstrations. After his expulsion, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> continued to condemn Marxism as a failure and to urge democratic change in this authoritarian Communist state. He also sent an open letter to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in January calling for the release of political prisoners. `` Many people do n't agree with Marxism, even workers and students,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last year. `` Even people of my generation ... do n't believe in Marxism.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> professor was at the center of a U.S.-Chinese controversy in February when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police prevented him from attending a banquet given by visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Although he kept a low profile during the recent student-led demonstrations for democracy, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> just before he disappeared into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy that he feared he would be arrested as part of a crackdown on liberal intellectuals. His wife is a professor of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the country's most prestigious school, and also has criticized the lack of democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She was elected a deputy to the People's <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Haidian district by <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON> does not have the international standing enjoyed by <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> but nonetheless has waged a crusade for human rights and democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, 44, was jailed in 1979-83 after helping edit an underground pro-democracy magazine. After a long silence, he renewed his call for multi-party democracy late last year with an open letter to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a 22-page essay on freedom. After the recent pro-democracy movement began, he went to universities and student-occupied Tiananmen Square to read his essays on political reform. But <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> insisted he had no formal connection with the student protesters. At a news conference two week ago, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> told reporters he feared arrest but defended his actions and speeches. `` I must speak,'' he said. `` It is my fate to do such things.''

 It was a big weekend for 1939 movies with hometown folks celebrating in the birthplaces of both <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> to mark 50th anniversaries of the classics `` The Wizard of Oz'' and `` Gone With the Wind.'' Talking trees from Oz paraded in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, Saturday, and a barbecue in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, re-created the lawn party at Twelve Oaks, home of <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, on the eve of the Civil War in `` GWTW.'' No one seemed to pay much mind that neither <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> showed much interest in their tiny hometowns after shaking the dust from their heels on their respective roads to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and stardom. Folks in both towns are hoping that more hoopla about their famous former residents will boost tourism. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, best known as as <PERSON> Dorthy </PERSON> in `` Oz,'' was born in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumm </PERSON>. She who died in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1969 would have been 67 Saturday. <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> was born Feb. 1, 1901, in <LOCATION> Hopedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 10 miles from Saturday's festivities, but a monument to the actor is in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION> where he lived as a child. The gawky, big-eared boy never returned to <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after moving to <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> in 1917. Known as `` The King of Hollywood'' during his heyday, <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> played the Confederate blockade-runner <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> in `` Gone With the Wind,'' while <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> played the Southern belle <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. In Grand Rapids on Saturday, lawn chairs and strollers were 10-deep in some spots along the street for the Judy Garland Festival parade. <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Formica </PERSON>, who played a munchkin in `` Oz,'' was parade grand marshal. One float featured the Wicked Witch of the West, the talking trees with moving arms and even some flying monkeys. <PERSON> Lorelei </PERSON> <PERSON> Matten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wrenshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, was the official <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, and a half-dozen unofficial ones could be seen along the parade route wearing gingham jumpers and holding little black terriers or whatever other dog was available as a Toto stand-in. Two of the youngest actors in `` Gone With the Wind'' attended the Twelve Oaks barbecue in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Cammie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON>, the doomed child of <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, who portrayed the infant son of <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who played one of <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s suitors, also was on hand. `` I got the role by default,'' Ms. <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> recalled. `` My older sister was cast for the part, but by the time the shooting began, she was too old to play <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said he appeared in the film because <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> was a friend of his father's. `` When I was older, he took me for a ride in his new <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` That is the thoughtful kind of person he was.'' Grand Rapids, which was renamed the <LOCATION> Emerald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the nine-day festival that began Saturday, swelled to more than double its 8,000 residents as it celebrated one the world's most enduring films. Hotel, motel and resort rooms were filled for miles around, city tourism officials said. `` One old fellow from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said he's seen everything <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s ever done,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Erven </PERSON>, who staffed a tourist information booth in town `` He even went to her funeral. He said he would n't have missed this. Garland paraphernalia was everywhere, including hats, balloons, stickers, pins, T-shirts and post cards emblazoned with <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Toto </PERSON> and the rest of the Oz characters. `` I love her charisma, her windows to her soul,'' said <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> fan <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Savran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` You can read her so well. The pain. The struggles of her life.'' Not everyone had joined the fan club, though. `` I think it's kind of stupid,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaustad </PERSON>, a 17-year-old Grand Rapids High School student. `` She hated Grand Rapids. She said she did n't want to admit being born here. She wanted to get out of here as fast as possible.'' <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> left the area with her family when she was 4 years old and returned only once, in March 1938.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Pact In Hand, Unions Open Talks With Baby Bells</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two unions and the seven so-called Baby Bells spawned by the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup begin contract talks this month, a splintered and complex process affecting more than 350,000 workers in 48 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Across the tables from unions at negotiations in seven cities will be representatives from the highly profitable regional phone companies, several of which were hit by strikes three years ago in their first post-divestiture negotiations. `` Both sides had problems in 1986,'' <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said in an interview last week. `` There was no blueprint. There were people involved who had never negotiated a contract before.'' The unions, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, say the blueprint for this year's talks is the recent agreement they reached with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which includes wage and pension increases, a profit-sharing plan and an innovative package of benefits dealing with parental and elder care leaves and child care. Spokesmen for the regional phone companies, however, say they do not feel obligated to match the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T contract. `` We'd be reluctant to acknowledge that any patterns have been set,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. `` Things will vary from one region of the country to another and I do n't think we want to be locked into any feeling that a pattern has been set. We want to start at the beginning.'' Added <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>: `` We are different companies facing different circumstances and what <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> doe is between that company and those union members. Ours is a completely different situation as far as we are concerned.'' Nonetheless, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T briefed officials representing all of the regional companies last week. For <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, parent company for the local phone service providers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the beginning of the talks is Tuesday, the same day the unions first sit down for formal negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, which provides service to 14 states in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and West, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, which serves <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Talks between the unions and two of the companies begin Monday. They are <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of local phone companies in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, which serves nine southeastern states. Negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, which serves six <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, open on June 19 and the final <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which serves <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, will open formal negotiations June 26. Four of the contracts expire Aug. 5; the others Aug. 12, except for <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which faces a July 1 deadline and has already begun negotiations. Parts of <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> were struck in 1986. <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said the unions were making preparations for strikes this year as well but said he was optimistic settlements would be reached by the deadlines. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> represents all but 32,000 of the 352,000 union workers at the seven companies, with <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> representing the others. The unions have a nationwide agenda that will dominate all of the talks, but there are a number of local issues as well. The national issues will mirror those in the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T talks, with health insurance again likely to emerge as the major hurdle to settlements. <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> identified <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> as the companies with which he expected the greatest fight over health insurance. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> already have in place many of the cost-containment measures that were inserted into the recent <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T agreement. The unions also want all of the companies to offer profit sharing; some now offer performance-related bonuses but the unions say they are inadequate. Another provision of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T contract the unions will be seeking in the regional talks is company participation in a lobbying effort designed to curb rising health care costs through revisions in federal policy. <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said he was optimistic the companies would sign on, but said the larger problem will be getting them, major employers from other industries, lawmakers and interest groups to reach consensus on a strategy. As for local issues, disputes over job titles and use of outside contracts likely will surface at all of the regional talks. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> is the only one of the Baby Bells still offering cost of living adjustments to its workers and any attempt by the company to eliminate those would be meet heavy resistance from union negotiators.

 Companies are handing out $ 5,000 checks, paying hotel bills and promising more help for people whose low-income neighborhood was ravaged by a runaway train and exploding pipeline. But many furious survivors are afraid to return home, and worry they wo n't recover their losses, particularly less-tangible losses like a drop in property values. `` I do n't like the neighborhood any more. There's not much of it left,'' said plumber <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON>, 30. <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> lived 1 -LCB- blocks from the row of <LOCATION> Duffy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> homes demolished one month ago Monday when an overloaded freight train speeding down from <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> at 90 mph derailed on a curve. After the wreck, <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> inspected its 14-inch pipeline buried next to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> tracks, and assured residents they could safely return home. The 250-mile pipeline provides 90 percent of Las Vegas' gasoline and supplies three <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. But on May 25, the pipeline ruptured, spewing gasoline that exploded in a fireball and engulfed homes spared by the train wreck. The toll of the twin disasters: six people dead, 42 injured, 800 to 1,000 evacuated, and at least 22 homes destroyed, significantly damaged or considered unsafe to reoccupy. Trains are running again. After failed legal efforts by the city and residents, gasoline resumed flowing Friday through the repaired and reinforced 600-foot section of pipe. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> and government officials again are telling residents of the roughly 200 homes in the subdivision that it's safe to go home. `` This is probably the most looked at and examined pipeline in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Calnev spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said. `` I would not hesitate moving back into this neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrukaitis </PERSON>, vice president of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> GATX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s parent company. `` They told us that after the derailment,'' said <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> resident <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 21. `` Everybody believed it and moved back in. And what happens? It blows up after they say they checked it. They messed up and I'm never going by their word again.'' Police Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkle </PERSON> estimated that by Sunday, only 40 percent of the evacuated residents had returned. `` We deeply regret that this occurred,'' <PERSON> Andrukaitis </PERSON> said. `` The only thing Calnev can do is everything in its power to work with the citizens and elected officials to get them back to where they were.'' <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the city's costs, and buy the 22 homes, most of which have been razed. They are footing hotel and restaurant bills until Monday for evacuees from undamaged homes. The companies distributed dozens of $ 5,000 checks to heads of evacuated households. Recipients still can sue. <PERSON> Andrukaitis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> claims manager <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> estimate the companies will spend tens of millions of dollars. Southern Pacific accepted full blame for the derailment. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is investigating <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s post-derailment pipeline inspection, and whether the pipeline was dented or cracked by the train wreck <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> acknowledged it visually inspected only portions of the pipe. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> residents like <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON> believe another derailment is possible. `` We ca n't go back _ the fear, the apprehension and anxiety,'' said the 36-year-old real estate agent. `` I've got to make mortgage payments on a place I ca n't even live in. Real estate values are just gone. They ought to clear the whole area.'' `` We're not going to buy the whole neighborhood,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> replied. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> said the railroad and <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> will establish a panel of retired judges to arbitrate claims by residents who say their property values plummeted. <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> predicted most claims will be settled without lawsuits. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said residents soon will realize `` we really are intending to right as much of the problem as is possible.'' That's not good enough for many. `` It was a nice neighborhood,'' said retiree <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>. `` It was quiet, and we could let our kids run loose.'' `` Now,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON>, 19, `` we've got to worry about them blowing up.''

<TEXT>
 Moslem rebels said Sunday they ambushed and killed an Afghan army colonel and nine soldiers on the main road linking <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital and the besieged eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said guerrillas launched another attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> during the weekend with rockets and artillery, killing 10 people and injuring 16. It said `` considerable damage was done to the city'' and that the cities of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gardiz </PERSON> also were under fire. Insurgents, known as the mujahedeen or Islamic Holy Warriors, ambushed three government convoys on Wednesday and Thursday along a 40-mile stretch of the road linking <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said 10 soldiers were killed, including a colonel, and 27 were wounded. One officer deserted to the mujahedeen, the agency said. <PERSON> Qaribur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, head of the news agency, said he did not know the colonel's identity. There was no independent confirmation of the attack. The mujahedeen, backed principally by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have besieged <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> since March 6, three weeks after Soviet troops ended nine years of intervention on behalf of the communist regime. The guerrillas have rendered the communist-held airport unsafe but supplies have been dropped by air to government forces. A few armored convoys have fought their way through from the west. The guerrilla news agency said 51 communist soldiers have died and 54 have been wounded in fighting around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since June 7. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report said that the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> air force attacked enemy positions outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, killing 270 guerrillas. It claimed 12 were Pakistani military personnel. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of aiding the rebels and violating the accord that resulted in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied that its troops have aided the guerrillas. Meanwhile, two of the most powerful mujahedeen groups, the Jamiat-i-Islami of <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> and the Hezb-i-Islami of <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, both based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, denied claims by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government that guerrilla commanders approached the communists for a truce. `` The regime's claims that the mujahedeen commanders have contacted them is based on fabrication and falsehood ...,'' they said in a joint statement. They said it was a ploy by Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> to sow discord among rebel groups. `` The writing on the wall is clear _ the puppet regime's days are numbered,'' the statement said. Guerrilla leaders predicted the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> would fall quickly after the Soviet troop withdrawal. But <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has cited his forces' tenacious defense of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> as proof that his government has the power to survive. He has offered repeated deals to the rebels to end the fighting and recently launched a propaganda campaign indicating the insurgents were pressing for peace. But guerrilla leaders, who want to establish an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, have rejected overtures from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling party seized power in a 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem insurgency.

 Hundreds of protesters and even some police officers wept as two Chinese diplomats made a surprise and emotional public appeal for political asylum, and rally organizers Sunday predicted more defections. `` Many of my friends have lost their lives and we wanted to do something to show we support what they stood for,'' said one of the diplomats during a rally Saturday night against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s repression of the pro-democracy movement. `` Compared to them, I am not brave at all,'' added the man, who was not immediately identified. `` They are brave for standing up for democracy in the face of death or imprisonment.'' The two men, identified as a vice consul for cultural affairs and an overseas affairs officer, told the crowd of 5,000 they decided to defect after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> leaders launched a propaganda campaign claiming no citizens died in the clash. Chinese troops opened fire on tens of thousands of students and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents June 4 to put an end to the seven-week pro-democracy movement and the sit-in at the city's <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence estimates put the number of people slain in the hundreds and possibly the thousands. `` We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed. Why? Because we are diplomats. But we wo n't fake it here. Before we are diplomats, we are Chinese and we are human beings,'' one of the men told the crowd. `` We are public servants, we are not slaves,'' he added. The whereabouts of the diplomats Sunday were not immediately known. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would not release their names but confirmed the two requested political asylum. A bureau spokeswoman Sunday said only that their case would be handled by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A staffer in the office of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> regional director, said Sunday morning the two had not filed an asylum request. He would not give his name. To obtain political asylum, an applicant must show a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Daria </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said the department had no immediate comment on the situation. Telephone calls to the Chinese consulate went unanswered. Organizers at the rally and candlelight memorial said at first they refused to allow the consulate officials to address the crowd outside City Hall. Even later, when event organizers were convinced of their sincerity, three people were posted alongside the diplomats on stage to yank them off in case of trouble. `` We did n't know if they'd start a riot or what, and it was a complete surprise for everyone when they said what they did,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wou </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, one of the sponsors of the rally. `` But then we were ecstatic and everybody was hugging them and crying and saying that they were true Chinese and very, very brave,'' <PERSON> Wou </PERSON> said. He said he saw several police officers weeping after the announcement. Wou and other rally organizers predicted there would be other defections from Chinese consulates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are encouraging this sort of thing to happen and expect more people to come out of these consulates to freedom,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, general coordinator of San Francisco-based Support Democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Wou </PERSON> said he expects most Chinese students eventually to return home to support the pro-democracy cause. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Man-kar </PERSON>, an editor at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, on Sunday identified the two from their business cards as <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-ming </PERSON>, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-man </PERSON>, 25, acting consul for overseas affairs. He said both had been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 2 -LCB- years and were unmarried. He estimated that the total number of Chinese staff members and dependents at the consulate was 300 to 400. <PERSON> Wou </PERSON> said the diplomats told him they had walked to the rally after finishing dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>, about a half-mile away. On the way, they stopped at a public telephone and called the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which escorted them to an undisclosed location from the rally. The defections were announced in Chinese and English at the protest, where a largely Asian crowd denounced the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. Many wore black arm bands and carried banners reading `` Their blood, Our tears.''

The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been a board member since 1968. Hammer, 91, dashed expectations in January 1988 by announcing he would not be donating his collection of Old Master and 19th century paintings to the museum. He had insisted that his collection be housed in its own wing, separate from the museum's existing collection and overseen by a separate curator, <PERSON> Belin </PERSON> and others said. `` That was unacceptable,'' <PERSON> Belin </PERSON> said. Hammer subsequently decided to house his art in a private museum to be built in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> for at least $ 86 million. Several <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have filed a lawsuit trying to block the plan, claiming it is a waste of corporate assets without significant benefit to the company.

 In an odd way, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> feels honored. `` Very few people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have had the privilege of being sued not only by a country, but by a religion,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said following the conclusion of a six-day civil trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week. The Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Autocephalous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> are demanding the return of four sixth-century Christian mosaics. Taken from a church in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1979, the works were purchased by <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> last summer. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> says she fell in love with the rare Byzantine pieces and purchased them for $ 1.1 million only after her investigation turned up no evidence they had been reported stolen. She later offered them for sale for $ 20 million, but they are off the market pending the outcome of the lawsuit. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON>'s decision, which is not expected until August at the earliest, could rest on two legal questions: _ Did <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> act recklessly and hastily when she purchased the mosaics during a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in July _ Did <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> diligently seek the return of the mosaics and try to notify the international art community after it learned the works were stolen in 1979 At stake are not only the `` spiritual treasures'' of one of the earliest Christian religions, but also the status of antiquities in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> museums and around the world, analysts say. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s actions were criticized in testimony from three witnesses: a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor and curators at the J. Paul Getty Museum in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> Art Gallery in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vikan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> gallery said the objects, circumstances and people involved in <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s purchase should have warned her away. Among those who brought <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> into the deal were an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> art dealer who has used three names and a Dutchman who has been convicted of art forgery in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, court records show. The Dutchman, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rijn </PERSON>, is well-known as a `` shady dealer'' who markets stolen art, <PERSON> Vikan </PERSON> testified. But <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> testified she liked <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rijn </PERSON> and he seemed to have universal respect in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. `` There was n't anyplace that we went that somebody did n't come out of a shop and say, ` Hi, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>,''' she said. `` We were always bumping into people he would chat with and introduce me to.'' The roughly 2-foot-square mosaics _ which depict the heads of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a boy, the apostles <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and an archangel _ were taken from a war-torn area of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> under control of a breakaway Turkish state recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vikan </PERSON> testified he would have walked away from the purchase. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he might have gone ahead. `` When confronted by a really major work of art, and it's perfectly clear the piece is authentic and of unequaled quality, I might well have proceeded the same way My God, yes,'' <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON> testified on <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s behalf. <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON> also testified he felt <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> had left `` no stone unturned'' in her investigation. `` I think her inquiry met the best professional standards,'' <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON> said. `` I could n't have expected more.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> seemed incredulous at the suggestion she would sacrifice her business and the livelihood of her partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, by purchasing stolen artwork. `` Who in their right mind can imagine that we would borrow one million dollars to buy stolen property?'' she said. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s attorneys tried to prove <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> gave up claim to the mosaics when Greek Cypriots fled the village of <LOCATION> Lythrankomi </LOCATION> in 1976, leaving the church and its mosaics unattended. Turkish forces had taken control of the area, stifling the rights of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> citizens, Greek Cypriots testified. `` Did, in fact, southern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> have a right to lay claim to something in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> asked. Six Greek Cypriot officials testified how they tried to recover the mosaics against political and bureaucratic roadblocks erected by the division of their country. They said they notified museums and agencies of the theft, issued press releases and sent representatives to speak about stolen Cypriot antiquities at international art conferences. However, none of them could say they had notified <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, an international police agency, or tried to pursue <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON>, the Turk who sold the mosaics to <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and who had been publicly linked to the mosaics in 1982.

<HEAD>One in Four U.S. Households Hit by Crime Last Year, Survey Finds</HEAD>

 One of every four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households was the target of a violent crime or theft in 1988, the same proportion as the previous three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. This proportion remained at the lowest level since the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> began calculating the household rate in 1975. That year, almost one in three households was the target of a violent crime. `` In 1988, 27 percent of households with incomes of $ 25,000 or more, 29 percent of black households and 30 percent of urban households were touched by crime,'' the report found, adding that <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> households remained more vulnerable to crime than non-Hispanic households. Geographically, households in the Northeast were the least vulnerable to crime, with 19 percent hit, while those in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> suffered the most with 30.3 percent. About 24.9 percent of Midwestern households and 24.4 percent of Southern households were hit, the report found. The report, based on the National Crime Survey, covered 92.9 million households and found that 22.8 million experienced a theft or burglary or had a member who was raped, robbed or assaulted. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> does not include murders in the survey because it relies on a polling technique based on what the crime victim says and then estimates a total amount of crime nationwide. Murder statistics would not change the overall figures for household crimes, the bureau said. Other crimes not measured by the crime survey include kidnapping and arson. Overall, members of about 141,000 households were raped, 872,000 were robbed and 3.7 million were assaulted, and the bureau found a total of 7.19 million households, or one in 13, were targeted by crimes of `` high concern,'' including rape, robbery, assault by a stranger or a burglar. Black households, 29 percent of which were touched by crime, were significantly more vulnerable to crime than white households, of which 23.9 percent were targeted, the bureau found. In addition, black households were more likely than white households, if victimized, to be victimized by a serious violent crime or a crime of high concern, the report said. A total of 16 percent of the black households touched by crime in 1988 had a member suffer a rape, robbery or aggravated assault, while 9 percent of white households had a member who suffered from one of those crimes, according to the study. The bureau, in trying to explain the overall downward trend in the households-touched-by-crime indicator since 1975, said `` population movements and changes in household composition undoubtedly affected'' it. In addition to a movement away from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in the South and West as well as away from urban areas into suburban and rural areas, the report noted that the average American household decreased in size during the 1975-88 period. `` One-person households represented 21 percent of all households in 1975 but 25 percent in 1988,'' which the percentage of households containing six or more people fell from 7 percent to 3 percent, the report said. If a household contains more people, it is more vulnerable to crime, particularly for personal crimes since larger households have more members at risk, the study said.

 President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> will assume power several months ahead of schedule in an agreement being worked out with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s lame-duck leader, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, officials said Sunday. The arrangement would allow <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> to begin tackling the nation's crippling economic problems sometime this summer, rather than wait until December, when he is scheduled to take over from President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> `` I have no doubt he does n't want to stay until Dec. 10,'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>, an official of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. `` There will be an accord shortly.'' <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> was the governing party candidate for vice president in the May 14 elections, which were won by <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is scheduled to take office on Dec. 10. But with the economy in chaos and food riots in early June that left 14 dead, many people have called on <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to step aside sooner. Although no date was set in weekend talks between the two main parties, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> might hand over power in the first half of August, said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> president and a key adviser to his older brother. President-elect <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has said he wo n't push <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to step down early. But last week, after he appointed a Cabinet and fleshed out an economic plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> said he was prepared to take power any time. Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> election landslide, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> offered to step down early, but he could not agree with <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> on terms. The main differences were over economic policies and how <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> could leave office without resigning. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> also insisted that <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> congressmen who won election with him take office when he does and that the trials of military officers charged with human rights abuse during the 1976-83 dictatorship be resolved by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. The military `` situation stems from the current government and I consider it convenient that the answer and the solution be granted by this government,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said. In an apparent solution worked out over the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> would meet early to confirm <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s victory and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would modify the law that sets the transition day. That would allow <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to step down without resigning. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> congressmen would agree to support whatever legislation <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> deemed necessary to stabilize the economy, which has soared out of control under <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. Hyperinflation, economic recession and high unemployment caused food riots in which Argentines looted supermarkets and grocery stores. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> declared a nationwide state of siege. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has tried to cut the budget deficit _ a main cause of inflation _ by cutting government spending and raising tariffs for public services. The measures, coupled with inflation expected to reach 70 percent this month, have torn into pocketbooks and prompted cries for <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to leave office early. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has said the higher rates are `` anti-popular.'' Measures reportedly being developed by the economy minister-designate, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, include an across-the-board wage raise, easy access to <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> credit, and a new currency to replace the austral. It was unclear how the military issue, which has brought on three insurrections against <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, would be resolved. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office in December 1983 for a six-year term after elections that ended rule by military dictators since 1976. He was barred by the consitution from seeking re-election.

 Two Iranians died and thousands fainted as huge crowds flocked to the grave of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Sunday for a memorial service marking a week since his death. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s most powerful leaders were among the more than 1 million mourners at <LOCATION> Beheshte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zahra </LOCATION> cemetery, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, according to Iranian press reports monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` Soon this site will become a shrine to attract the Moslems of the world,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who broke into tears during his speech. `` This is a center which radiates heavenly light.'' In Islam, the seventh and 40th days after death are considered a time for special mourning rites. Free food and drink was distributed around the grave. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run television showed mourners beating their heads and chests with clenched fists in the Shiite Moslem expression of grief and chanting `` <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, why did you leave us?'' But the atmosphere appeared calmer than during Tuesday's burial, which was delayed for six hours after some in the hysterical crowd of 2 million tore pieces from <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s white shroud and sent the body falling to the ground. The 86-year-old patriarch died June 3 after suffering a heart attack. There were eight deaths and 11,000 injuries in subsequent three days of mourning. On Sunday, one man died of a heart attack and another died after falling from a cargo container used for television cameras, according to press reports. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the mourners were so densely packed during the afternoon ceremony that on average one person fainted every second in temperatures around 96. The sick were passed overhand to one of 23 mobile medical units stationed around the site and more than 1,000 doctors and medical workers were on duty, the news agency reported. More serious injuries were rushed to nearby hospitals in one of 250 ambulances. The television, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, showed a shrine built from four metal cargo containers to stop crowds from carrying off the dirt. The containers were covered in green, a holy color for Islam, and were topped with a golden dome and a black flag. The television showed weeping mourners gripping a metal grille built around the structure, trying to touch and kiss the shrine, which they consider sacred. Those unable to reach it threw clothes and other articles to the guards standing on top the containers. The guards touched them to the shrine and threw them back. `` It would take a stone heart to stay composed at such a time,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said in his speech. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 43-year-old son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, was reported too overcome to speak. A crop-dusting plane sprayed rosewater on the mourners, and helicopters circled overhead, showering the crowds with flowers. The agency said crowds began collecting at the grave site on Saturday night and swelled to almost 2 miles wide. There were unprecedented traffic jams on the expressway leading to the cemetery. In a related development, Iranian opposition leaders said exiled Iranians living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have flocked to rebel training camps, reopened after the death of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, a guerrilla spokesman said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the armed wing of the Baghdad-based <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, received many new supporters in the past week and sent them to camps on the Iraq-Iran border, according to spokesman <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliamani </PERSON>. The camps were closed after the Aug. 20 U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war then reopened in a show of strength following <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death, according to diplomatic sources. They said, however, there was no indication the rebels would attack <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in violation of the cease-fire. The rebels fought alongside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the gulf war.

Under the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, named for late Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reserved the right to intervene _ as it did in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956 and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 _ to preserve communist regimes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' was asked about the longer-term prospects for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which recently began taking down its `` Iron Curtain'' barbed wire and fortifications along its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The envoy said the outlook depends partly on what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations do. `` If we come into these countries with our political parties, our trade unions, with our ideas, our values and our institutions, our churches, our universities, our foundations, I think there's a real chance that what you will see 10 years from today in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is a Western country,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. Also interviewed on the program was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where candidates backed by the Solidarity movement won a resounding victory in parliamentary elections last week. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was asked whether Solidarity would now be a permanent political force in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, or could be suppressed again in a way comparable to the martial law crackdown in 1981. `` I think it's back to stay,'' he replied. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> added: `` I think that Solidarity has proved through its nonviolence, its responsible attitude and its willingness to share power in the country that it is a partner that the government can look forward to working with. `` In fact, the situation now is that the government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the communist government, can not pass any legislation without the agreement of Solidarity,'' the ambassador said.

 The city government ignored a Sunday deadline set by protesters to open talks and instead continued arresting leaders of the pro-democracy movement. Authorities also expelled a British journalist, the first foreign newsman ordered out of the country since the protest movement began seven weeks ago. At a rally Friday, students gave the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> municipal government 48 hours to agree to direct talks on democratic reform, publicize the truth of the military attack in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and fly flags at half-staff in this city to commemorate the victims of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Chinese troops stormed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central square a week ago, shooting their way through the student-led protesters. Western diplomats and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources have estimated that 3,000 were killed. The People's Square in downtown <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> was largely empty Sunday despite students' threat to resort to stronger tactics if their ultimatum was not met. The inactivity by protesters was reflected across <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the government intensified its crackdown, rounding up leaders of independent worker and student groups and waging a propaganda war to discredit demonstrators. `` Our hearts support the students' struggle for democracy,'' said one worker at a cargo firm. `` But many people feel it is time to stop the protests and think of the best way to achieve the goal.'' `` There was no way the government would agree to their demands,'' said a young worker at <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s riverfront. `` They know the students are all gone, that they're not at their schools.'' News reports in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the largest city in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a population of 12 million, announced more arrests Sunday in a continuing crackdown, but no figure was given. Up to 680 people have been arrested nationwide, according to partial estimates in some cities. <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzhan </PERSON>, identified as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested at <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s international airport in the company of consular officials from an unnamed country, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> radio said. Police also arrested <PERSON> Weng </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhengming </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, on Saturday, state-run television news said. It claimed <PERSON> Weng </PERSON> had drafted plans as early as 1986 to overthrow the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. About 200 workers mobilized by the government to maintain order gathered outside <ORGANIZATION> Tongji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Workers said Mayor <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongji </PERSON> ordered 10 percent of all factory workers in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to report for such duty. `` We're here to keep traffic flowing smoothly,'' said a 22-year-old woman at the <ORGANIZATION> Tongji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> gate. She denied the group was there to keep students from marching off campus. City officials also cracked down on foreign journalists. Authorities ordered <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newport </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> out of the country for filming a student sit-in in front of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s police headquarters, said a British diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> municipal government issued an open letter Saturday to all diplomatic missions in the city, instructing them to tell journalists from their countries that they can not cover news in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> without government permission. `` Some unexpected danger may arise and we are unable to guarantee their life security,'' said the English letter, signed by the consular division of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` Please call the journalists' attention to that.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Walks Tightrope in Signing Chelsea School Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unprecedented experiment in public education is about to begin with Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expected to sign a bill Monday that will let <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> take over the troubled school system in the city of <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>. The plan, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> after months of sometimes bitter discussion, will link a public school system with one of the highest dropout rates in the state _ 17 percent _ to a world-class university with all its financial and educational resources. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> will get the prestige of conducting an educational experiment never before tried in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, one that will be watched closely and possibly duplicated by universities around the country. `` One of the things I think we'd like to encourage in this state is innovation and experimentation,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` And there's no question this is innovative and experimental.'' `` We have a bill which I think has real promise for the future of the schoolchildren in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's an experiment, and like most experiments, it is one that has to be tried before we know whether it will succeed.'' Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> will run the 3,600-student system for 10 years and pump in money from private donors and foundations for a variety of new programs, including early childhood education, counseling and nutritional services. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> schools have been woefully underfunded, according to officials in the largely Hispanic, working-class city of 25,000 outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> has seen its tax base shrink and faces cuts of about $ 2.8 million in next year's school budget because of a state budget crunch. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to agree to any language guaranteeing open meetings while orally promising to abide by state open-meeting laws had held up the bill and had put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a difficult position once the measure reached his desk. Local teachers unions and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, which endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his bid for president last year, had complained that the pact would allow <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> to make decisions behind closed doors. But a veto would have set up <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for an embarrassment, since the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had passed the bill with enough votes to override. On Friday, however, the governor said he would sign the bill _ and also direct the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to set up a monitoring panel to make sure BU abides by the open-meeting and public-records laws. That move seemed to satisfy several factions that were practically at one another's throats days earlier. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> administrators were delighted with the announcement, saying it allowed them to begin raising the roughly $ 30 million they hope to spend over the next decade. Hispanics opposed the agreement, saying university officials have ignored requests for more information about bilingual programs. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said he would heed concerns raised. `` We are not going to privatize the schools,'' <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said. `` We are going to manage the public schools and they are going to remain public.'' For higher education there could be a long-term benefit if the BU experiment succeeds. `` Universities are looking at themselves and saying, ` What is our role in terms of the reform movement in education?''' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> education school. `` One thing universities have said is say how bad the entering freshmen are.''

 Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> laid a wreath at the grave of one of his country's war heroes on Sunday and ignored the jeers of anti-communist emigres. The Polish leader, on the second day of a British visit, was heckled by protesters as he honored Gen. <PERSON> Wladislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, commander of the Free Polish Forces who joined the Allies against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. Police sealed off the Polish war graves section of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, 125 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, several hours before <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> arrived in a 12-car motorcade. He left immediately after the short ceremony for lunch with local officials and a return flight to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, a prime minister of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1922-23, was killed in an air crash in the British colony of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on July 4, 1943. He is buried with other Free Polish veterans, many of whom served at <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> air bases during the war. The British visit, preceded by a one-day stop in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, was <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s first trip outside <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since his communist party suffered a resounding defeat in national elections to the Solidarity-led political opposition. Several hundred Polish emigres, some holding banners saying `` <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who are you kidding?'' and `` We want 100 percent democracy,'' gathered outside the cemetery entrance and yelled as <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> arrived. Several dozen protesters slipped around to the side of the cemetery near the Polish war graves and shouted `` sacrilege!'' at <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> while he laid the wreath. `` This man -LRB- <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> -RRB- is the one who sent tanks against his own people and he is a product of his masters, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rynkiewicz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poles </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which sponsored the protest. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> ordered a martial law crackdown to crush Solidarity in December 1981. It was made legal again under an agreement in April that also allowed limited opposition participation in elections. The emigres also said it was <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>'s last wish that his body not be returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> until his homeland was free. `` The Polish government wants the world to think that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is free. They want to use Gen. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>'s return as window dressing,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eaton </LOCATION>. He served in the Free Polish Forces. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has refused requests for the return of his body to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where a marble tomb awaits his burial among the last Polish kings. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> did not raise the issue during his meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Saturday. During the visit, the British told <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> they would provide limited economic aid, including a $ 7.75 million annual contribution to a new fund to train Poles for a more market-oriented economy. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also agreed to press for rescheduling of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 38 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has been stepping up contacts with Western countries, mainly in the hope of getting economic aid after the domestic political reforms.

<HEAD>New Security Devices Detect Plastic Explosives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two new security systems capable of detecting plastic explosives were displayed Sunday at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show, the first international aviation exposition since the December bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103. The sophisticated systems, both on the market for the first time this spring, were created by two American companies. The companies were invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to show the new technology during the 10-day gathering at <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bourget </LOCATION> airport north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In recent years, searches, metal detectors and X-ray machines have become routine at airports and the number of hijackings has declined. But passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices. It takes less than a pound of plastic explosive, the size of a chocolate bar, to bring down a jumbo jet. The deadly material can be molded into shapes that are easy to hide. Such an explosive hidden in a casette tape player is believed to have caused the death of 275 passengers aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet downed over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbee </LOCATION> in December. <ORGANIZATION> Thermedics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, came up with a `` sniffer'' that detects chemical vapors. The $ 125,000 hand-held sniffer, called <ORGANIZATION> EGIS </ORGANIZATION>, is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules, called algorithms. `` If you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attempted bombing, in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraft cabin,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Thermedics </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` This illustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags as well as checked luggage.'' <ORGANIZATION> Thermedics </ORGANIZATION> has developed a second sniffer that is about a year away from the markeplace. It is called SecurScan and works on the same principle as <ORGANIZATION> EGIS </ORGANIZATION> but is designed as a walk-through chamber similar to the now common metal detector. A second new device is being shown by <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Their apparatus is called a thermal neutron activation, or <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> and sells for $ 900,000 Baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it is showered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen, the chemical emitted by virtually all explosives. The reaction produces a scattering of gamma rays, a sort of chemical fingerprint that is analyzed by a computer. Six units have been purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for installation at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> and 12 others will be installed in high-risk airports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas. Meanwhile, thousands of visitors to the airshow cast their eyes skyward over <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourget </ORGANIZATION> airport Sunday to watch the first demonstration flight by a Soviet MiG-29 since the crash of an identical fighter last week. The camouflage-green fighter, emblazoned with a red star flew loops and spins in the blue sky, its engines spitting pale fire. The sister MiG-29 crashed just after the opening of the air show on Thursday, but pilot <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON> managed to eject from the plane at 500 feet.

 A committee investigating a helicopter crash that killed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s defense minister determined the crew lost control of the chopper during a sandstorm, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the committee's report blamed `` extraordinarily bad weather conditions and lack of visibility coupled with a sandstorm'' for the crash that killed Gen. <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON>. There were no indications of mechanical trouble, an explosion or fire aboard the U.S.-made Bell military helicopter, which had flown for only 603 hours when it crashed in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on May 5. Bell helicopters normally are used by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and his aides when traveling inside the country. <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON>, who was deputy armed forces commander-in-chief and a close confidante of <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, was killed along with six others, on a flight to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> from a mountain resort near <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>, 280 miles northwest of the capital. He was considered the second-most powerful man in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>. The helicopter went down near the village of <LOCATION> Kweir </LOCATION>, close to the main Mosul-Kerkuk road, an uncultivated area inhabited by <PERSON> Bedouin </PERSON> tribes, the report said. <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>'s brother-in-law but had recently been at odds with the president, was the third senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official to die in a helicopter crash in the past 18 months. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON> had a brief misunderstanding in late 1988 over the president's treatment of his oldest son, <PERSON> Odai </PERSON>. The report said the meteorological department at the Firnass air base had warned of possible sandstorms and bad visibility in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the investigating committee included representatives of the army transportation staff, the air force and air defense command, military intelligence and general security service, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> intelligence agency and the military's technical department.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> is both an environmental activist and a convicted cop killer, a combination which may prove deadly to an annual festival that raises money for conservation. The <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> executive says that because <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> edits a newsletter published by the event's sponsor, the county will back out of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in coming years. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police say they wo n't help patrol the festival this year in their off hours. `` This guy is a convicted killer of a police officer who was a member of my department,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbolic </PERSON>, head of the county <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are n't going to work for people who hire cop-killers.'' For five years, <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> have co-edited The Navigator, the newsletter of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sloop </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, the group founded by folksinger <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> to help clean up the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> did his work from a prison cell until this year, when he was granted clemency by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, who has always claimed his innocence, was convicted of the 1968 murder of <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. This year's festival is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Westchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. It has roots going back more than 20 years, when <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> sang on a lawn and passed the hat to raise money to build the <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, a replica of a 19th century sloop. The ship has sailed the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> to promote efforts to clean the river, efforts that have met with some success. The full-scale festival has been staged annually for 12 years. Last year, 20,000 people attended. The county contributed services it estimated to be worth $ 45,000, including bus transportation, park attendants and police. The county also allows use of the college campus. `` It's an impossible situation for <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> to give up to $ 45,000 in taxpayer dollars to an organization which hired a cop killer, someone who murdered a <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy sheriff,'' said County Executive <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>. `` It's impossible to underwrite the organization. Public money can be better spent than paying <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and his wife put out the newsletter under a contract. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mylod </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, said the organization knew who <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> was when he was hired and has never tried to hide him. <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harbolic </PERSON> both said they failed to notice <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>'s name on the newsletter's masthead and had not seen a festival program in which <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> were pictured and profiled <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and his wife declined to be interviewed about the controversy. <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, 44, has maintained he was innocent in the 1968 shooting of Fitzgerald which occurred while <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> and two other inmates were being transported from the <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> to a White Plains court. <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> was serving time on a robbery charge when the shooting occurred. He said one of the other two inmates did the shooting. That inmate was killed in the shootout along with the deputy sheriff. He a model inmate and made powerful friends, such as <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and columnist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. When he was released this year, the parole board cited his `` outstanding record of institutional adjustment.'' <PERSON> Mylod </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> would not be let go because of the threats and protests: `` Some hateful things are being said.

He was unmoved by suggestions that some people might stay away from the festival this year because of the <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> connection; that's their right, he said. The same, he said, goes for police officers who may picket the fair. `` We may not have to worry about next year,'' he said. `` If it's a bad year financially _ especially if it really rains _ that may answer the question about next year from a practical, financial point of view rather than a political one.

The death toll remains uncertain, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence estimates say 3,000 died. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to suspend arms sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In a commentary carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, that country said: `` No matter what may happen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, it is not a business of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> across the ocean.''

In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, protesters burned a cardboard coffin marked `` Chinese soul'' next to the local office of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In keeping with Chinese funeral customs, the coffin as well as wreaths and banners were set on fire a week after the deaths. During a separate rally in a downtown park, thousands of people watched actors portray <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents braving bullets fired by troops. Organizers urged the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government not to arrest demonstrators, called for strikes in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and appealed to Chinese-funded companies to break with Chinese authorities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educators evacuated from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said Sunday they fear the departure of foreigners from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will leave student protesters and others there more vulnerable. `` We're worried not only about the safety of the students. We're worried about the safety of everybody in the university that we knew,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slifman </PERSON>, an economist from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION> He had been teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Wuhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. At a protest of about 5,000 people in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, two men identified as diplomats at the Chinese consulate said they no longer could support their government and were defecting. `` We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed. Why? Because we are diplomats. But we wo n't fake it here,'' one of them said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the asylum request but did not release the men's names. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Man-kar </PERSON>, an editor at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Chinese Times, identified the two as <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-ming </PERSON>, vice consul for cultural affairs; and <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-man </PERSON>, acting consul for overseas affairs.

 The government said Sunday it expects an international conference later this week to help it stem a tide of Vietnamese refugees. The two-day conference, which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has agreed to attend, will review an orderly departure program worked out by Southeast Asian countries in March. The agreements call on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to take back people who are merely economic refugees, but it has so far agreed to accept only those who volunteer for repatriation. The meeting, beginning Tuesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, should help relieve some of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s problems with the flood of boat people, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> state news agency. He said specifically that <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> hopes to close down one temporary camp with 15,000 refugees on Pulau island in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The March plan, which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> approved, also urges other third countries around the world to increase their intake of refugees. It must be approved in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> before it is put into effect. About 20,000 Vietnamese refugees remain in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, down from a peak of 76,500 in 1979. Under the March accords, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and other Southeast Asian countries have begun separately sheltering people viewed as economic refugees until they can be repatriated. Despite the agreements, many refugees have still fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and other Southeast Asian countries. In <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, 17 Vietnamese refugees arrived aboard a cargo ship Sunday. Their leader, 41-year-old <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON>, said he was a former lieutenant in the Vietnamese army.

<TEXT>
 Activists for battered women are advocating the maximum sentence for a man convicted only for manslaughter in the shooting of his estranged wife, a county judge. Sentencing was set for Monday. When Judge <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> was shot to death in her chambers eight months ago by <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>, a former police officer who was her estranged husband, deputy clerk <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> tried to stanch <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>' bleeding <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> still has nightmares about the shooting and attends weekly counseling sessions. She says she'll be among the many people expected to speak Monday before <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>'s sentencing. `` This has consumed me for months now,'' said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. `` Now, I want ` Rat' -LRB- <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> -RRB- to know what he's done to us here, the whole building. He did n't just kill <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, though that was horrifying enough in itself. He's changed all our lives. `` We'll never be the same again.'' A thousand people rallied last month outside the county Hall of Justice to protest the voluntary manslaughter conviction. On May 11, a jury acquitted <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> of first-degree murder, which carries a possible sentence of life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>, 53, testified that he was drunk and upset over their impending divorce and did not mean to kill <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>, 40. Manslaughter carries a sentence of up to 15 years. The jury also convicted <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> of attempted murder for firing at two officers who tried to help <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> _ a conviction that carries a potential sentence of life in prison with possibility of parole. `` We are outraged that the murder of a woman is considered less serious than shooting at _ and missing _ two men,'' said <PERSON> Dotti </PERSON> <PERSON> Clune </PERSON>, one of those who protested the verdict. Another deputy clerk, <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said she also would address <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolenda </PERSON> before the sentencing. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 27, said she opened the locked door to let <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> into his wife's chambers on the day of the shooting. `` At first, though, when it was happening, I laid under a desk and thought, ` God, I let that man in!'' she recalled. Also planning to speak are former college classmates of Irons who formed the <ORGANIZATION> Carol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in response to the Ratliff verdict. <PERSON> Kolenda </PERSON> said he was told <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>' brother, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, would speak. Her parents, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> of <PERSON> Farwell </PERSON>, have asked an attorney to speak on their behalf. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> will also have a chance to address the court before he is sentenced. `` This is the time for the defendant to tell me anything he wants me to consider, so he ca n't complain later something was said to which he did n't have a chance to respond,'' <PERSON> Kolenda </PERSON> said. `` I plan to be very explicit in explaining the process, what I'm doing and why I'm doing it I take time with every defendant,'' he said. `` But I'll be especially careful here, because I want absolutely no room for complaints on appeal and because there are so many people interested in this.''

<HEAD>New Orleans Board to Vote on Year-Round School Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Summer may be over almost before it's begun for students at two elementary schools where officials are planning to try the Three Rs year-round. The <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> meets Monday to make its final decison, after giving tentative approval in February to add 40 days to the school year at the two city schools. For pupils at <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> elementary schools who volunteer to take part, it would mean returning to school July 10 instead of Sept. 5 like the rest of the city's students The schools have a combined enrollment of 1,400. Its estimated cost would be $ 703,000 and some supporters fear board members might balk at the expense of the plan when they meet on Monday. `` We really have to try a model to work out the kinks,'' board member <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said Sunday. He said he expects a unanimous vote, even though some board members may have reservations about parts of the plan. `` It's expensive but it's worth spending the money to try it out.'' Plans call for the money to come from the federal government's Chapter I supplemental program for disadvantaged students _ about three-quarters of the students at each school are from low-income families, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said But federal rather than local tax dollars wo n't mean the program will be judged any less strictly, he said. `` It has to prove that it's cost-effective and can improve test scores and deportment in the schools,'' said <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>. `` We will see after the first year how well this program is judged.'' He said the program is planned for both <PERSON> Moton </PERSON>, which had 798 students last year, and <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON>, which had 710, because they serve students from the same general area _ an area which includes two housing projects. `` Sometimes the kids move around. We do n't want a situation where they move from one school to another and lose the services,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelka </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is one parent who will be disappointed if the year-round plan is postponed. `` Year-round school is a plus,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was at <LOCATION> Moton </LOCATION> on Thursday to pick up report cards for her five children, all of whom made the honor roll and earned perfect attendance certificates. `` A longer school year would give the children something better to do than playing in the street, especially in that dirty water after it rains,'' she said. Like other <PERSON> Moton </PERSON> parents, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the year-round program will give the children an alternative to the drugs and violence prevalent in the nearby Desire housing project area. `` I'd rather see them here safe than exposed to drugs in the streets,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, whose three children attend <PERSON> Moton </PERSON>. `` Three months without nothing to do is too much time wasted.'' While most American children spend 180 days in the classroom, school terms in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last 240 days. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> experiment would be for a 220-day term. Two American high schools offer an extended year. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has year-round schools, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said, but that program was started because there were too few school buildings rather than as an attempt to boost learning. <PERSON> Moton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> teachers were given the option of transferring to other schools, and student participation is voluntary. <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said all but two of his teachers signed up for the year-round program. `` The parents are enthused about it,'' he said.

 Iranian opposition forces, hoping to take advantage of the disarray in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, have reopened camps in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to train thousands of recruits, according to diplomats. They said Iranians living in exile in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have flocked to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death June 3. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is the military wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or People's Holy Warriors, the main Iranian opposition group. Thousands of exiled sympathizers were immediately sent to rebel bases along the Iran-Iraq border for training, according to a mujahedeen spokesman. `` A stream of our supporters has been pouring in and they are being given proper training in our bases here,'' said <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliamani </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Baghdad-based organization. He did not give figures on new recruits. Witnesses said dozens of military vehicles carrying rebel fighters were seen Thursday and Friday near northern Suliamaniya heading toward rebel camps on the border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The vehicles had <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> markings and bore mujahedeen emblems, they said. Border camps were closed after a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire halted the eight-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> fought alongside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the war and also halted operations inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the truce. But rebel leaders put their forces _ estimated at 20,000 _ on alert after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> underwent surgery May 23 to stop intestinal bleeding. After the patriarch's death, opposition leader <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajavi </PERSON> called on Iranians to prepare to welcome the rebels and help them when they move into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` at the appropriate moment.'' Rebel camps were reopened in a show of force, diplomats said. The diplomatic sources spoke on the condition they not be identified. But there has been no indication that the rebels are planning military action. Military analysts do not believe the rebels are strong enough to topple the Iranian government alone unless a power struggle develops. And despite earlier indications of factional fighting, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new leader, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> seems to be consolidating his position, sources said. In addition, any military move would need approval from the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government. It is thought unlikely that <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> would permit any action that might jeopardize the temporary truce with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or impede progress in deadlocked peace talks. One diplomat said although it was unlikely the rebels would move across the border while the cease-fire holds they might take advantage of any serious truce violation to attack Iranian positions or set up rebel bases inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> officials said the group's military strength has increased steadily since the cease-fire and that months of intensive training in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have made it `` a far more effective military force than before.'' The rebels were allied with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in the struggle to topple the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. But in 1980-81, a year after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> took power, he turned on the group and other leftist factions, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, said Sunday it would be a `` terrible mistake'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give up on maintaining relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government's harsh crackdown on the democratic reform movement. <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs to respond to the immediate situation there but also take a long-term approach rather than seek any kind of `` quick fix.'' The envoy's comments came in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> broadcast on the CBS program `` Face the Nation.'' `` I think we've gone through many ups and downs with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and I think right now we're going through a down,'' <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think we should sort of give up on it. I think that would be a terrible mistake.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can continue to have some influence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through avenues including <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts, training of Chinese students and `` in the multitude of business decisions that are made every day on the basis of investment climate and trading atmosphere.'' `` What we do is we play for the long term, and we do n't look for a quick fix. ... We look for a long term solution. And I think that's what we're working towards,'' <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said. The ambassador was asked about leading Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who has taken refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and is seeking political asylum. <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> responded: `` I would prefer not to discuss that situation. I will say that I have had conversations with them -LRB- Chinese officials -RRB- in the last two or three days. ... It's a very sensitive thing, and it's best to do it and shut up.'' <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> gave no indication during the interview that he was aware the Chinese government had issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, on charges of `` committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation.'' Asked if the Chinese had approached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials about the two dissidents, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused to comment on the report and on any aspect of the situation. Upon arrival at the White house from the Camp David weekend retreat, esident <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to give a reaction to the Chinese demand. As reporters shouted questions he cupped his hand to his ear and said: `` I ca n't hear a thing. This is not an appropriate time.'' The head of an organization supporting U.S.-China trade and business ventures said American companies should first take steps to ensure the safety of their personnel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, then carefully reassess their business prospects. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said that in the short term, `` Nobody's talking about business as usual. Business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been devastated, and it's very important for us to bring home to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people that their government did it.'' He estimated that up until the current turmoil, the American business presence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> totalled 8,000 to 9,000 people, with about 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies having investment contracts worth $ 3.4 billion. `` Companies are taking their people out. That's the first thing to do. I mean you've got to protect the safety and security of your people, and then take a long look at and test your assumptions about how you're going to be able to continue _ if indeed you're going to be able to continue at all,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Also appearing on the CBS program was Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who said he expects to see congressional action within the next 10 days on economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including a cutoff of high technology. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should act as a `` catalyst'' in promoting multilateral sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Western European countries and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, also endorsed a strategy of seeking multilateral economic sanctions. Interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should deprive <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of `` any special concessions or credits which they've been receiving in the past which we ordinarily would n't give to a communist regime which engages in the fundamental abuse of the human rights of its own people.'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> was asked about the question of maintaining electronic listening posts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which help monitor Soviet missile tests. He responded that `` in terms of the listening posts, I believe that those are mutually beneficial and so I do n't think we need to be overly concerned about them.''

 Maoist guerrillas killed a mayor in a small town in the <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION>, blew up electric power lines and burned the hammer and sickle symbol on a hillside, police said Sunday. Shining Path guerrillas on Saturday night seized the town of Aija, near <LOCATION> Huaraz </LOCATION>, 190 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, calling a popular assembly. During the meeting the mayor, <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Soria </PERSON>, 52, was given a `` popular trial'' and shot with a submachine gun, the police said. The guerrillas also ran up a red flag with the communist hammer and sickle. In two other incidents in two communities in the <LOCATION> Huaraz </LOCATION> area, the guerrillas ignited the symbol of the hammer and sickle made with cans full of oil on a hill, and they blew up two electric power lines, police said. Since 1980, when the Shining Path began its insurgency, more than 14,000 people have been killed in this impoverished nation.

<HEAD>Navy Changes Gunpowder Storage Practices After Iowa Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is changing the way it stores gunpowder for 16-inch guns on its Iowa-class battleships, despite indications that powder was not at fault in the fatal blast on the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. When the battleship <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> heads for maintenance and repairs this summer, its powder charges _ 110-pound bags _ will not be stored aboard uncooled, unventilated barges as the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s were, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials told The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. When the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> went in for similar overhaul during the summer of 1988, its powder was stored aboard uncooled barges at the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station on the <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> during the hottest part of the summer. In April, 47 sailors aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were killed when powder exploded in the No. 2 gun turret during open seas gunnery practice. Before the explosion, the No. 1 turret had a misfire when the five bags of powder used to propel the gun's projectile would n't ignite. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they do not believe the storage of the powder was to blame and are investigating the possibility of sabotage. Nevertheless, the charges aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> have been removed and replaced with powder that was stored in temperature-controlled underground bunkers. Smokeless powder is less stable and less effective `` if it is stored in damp atmosphere or subjected to high temperatures. A combination of the two is particularly bad,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manual </ORGANIZATION> OP5, the service's guide to munition storage. The manual says the powder charges decompose faster at temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, `` becoming relatively high at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and dangerously accelerated at temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit.'' An internal <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report estimates the temperature inside the aluminum-sided barges used for storage was 25 degrees higher than the outside air temperature. Using that estimate, the newspaper calculated from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> readings for the area that the temperature inside the barges could have exceeded 110 degrees on 66 days at the time the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s powder was in storage. The newspaper, quoting internal memos from the station's safety officer to his superiors, said the station's command was urged to remove the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s powder charges from the barges anchored at piers on the river bank. `` Permitting these charges to be stored in the barge for this period of time indicates the lack of importance that is placed on compliance with the safety requirements'' set forth in the manual on munition storage, a September 1988 memo said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, administrative officer at the <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION> station, said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s powder would not be stored at the station, the largest of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s six weapon stations. `` If it was for a short period, it would be something different. We'll move it inland, and then bring it back when it's needed,'' he said. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said additional magazines are being built at the weapons station to accommodate more munitions. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yorktown </PERSON> is the only one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s munitions stations that uses barges for temporary powder storage. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is continuing its investigation into the explosion, and has regularly declined to comment on its findings until the investigation is complete. Preliminary tests by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> powder have not shown any indications of instability, according to the Pentagon.

<TEXT>
 A mission from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> arrived Sunday for its second try at mediating the month-old election crisis, and the legislature's speaker urged the group to focus on what he called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meddling. The four-man delegation includes <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission failed on its trip in May to negotiate an end to the crisis, touched off when the government led by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled results of the May 7 presidential election. International observers say that when the counting was halted the opposition candidate had a 3-to-1 margin of victory over the one backed by the Noriega-controlled government. The opposition insists <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, must resign and that its victory be recognized. The government says <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s status is not negotiable and has proposed that a provisional junta take power Sept. 1, the constitutional inauguration date. The speaker of the Noriega-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday made public an open letter to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> asking it to focus its efforts on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions, not those of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The fundamental reasons for the Panamanian crisis are rooted in the open <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in our internal affairs aimed at maintaining hegemony in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the region,'' <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizo </PERSON> said in the letter. `` This intervention is carried through slander, disinformation, economic aggression, psychological war, constant violations of the Torrijos-Carter treaties and the threat of military attack.'' The treaties signed in 1977 by then-presidents <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> cede control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has long maintained the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to renege on the pacts. The falling out between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began last year when he was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> threw its support against the anti-Noriega movement that has so far failed to budge the strongman.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hungarian television on Sunday showed brief film footage of the trial of Premier <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, a leader of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt who was executed in 1958. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and the bodies of several of his close associates were buried in unmarked graves, but the remains are to be reburied during a ceremony Friday. Reformers, including <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, have claimed <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and the others were convicted at an unconstitutional `` show trial'' and said they should be `` rehabilitated.'' The film clip showed <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and some of his supporters being led into a courtroom where they were charged with crimes against the state. It was shown during a half-hour news program on the 1956 revolt when <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s government sought to organize multiparty free elections and sever <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ties with the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance. Soviet tanks crushed the revolt and <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and hundreds of other government and political leaders were arrested. The bodies of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and a few associates were dumped in a grave in a cemetery in suburban Budpest. During Friday's ceremony, which will be televised, the remains will be buried again in the same cemetery. Re-evaluation of the revolt began after hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, was ousted in May 1988 under strong criticism from reformers. In a statement last week the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership called <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> a `` significant'' figure in post-World War II <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Leading Communist reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, in an interview on Sunday's television program, said the time has come `` to face the facts of what happened between Oct. 1956 and June 1958.'' He said <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s trial was a `` political trial on trumped up charges.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, who also was interviewed on the program, said `` many of the tasks he -LRB- <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> -RRB- set remain important to this day.''

<HEAD>Republicans Aren't Pinning Hopes on Wright Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials are playing down their chances for Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 12th District seat despite an ethics investigation that forced the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker to resign. `` It's like running the 100-yard dash between a Republican and a Democrat, and giving the Democrat an 80-yard head start,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> political consultant in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. `` It's not a fair race.'' Republican officials point to several factors in their decision to focus their efforts elsewhere. The district, which includes all of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and most of its surrounding communities, was drawn by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself. It is full of blue-collar Democrats and boasts a solid bloc of minority voters that averages 30 percent to 40 percent of the voter turnout. In addition, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brought home more defense contracts, jobs and federal funding than any other large urban area in the country received, according to a computer study earlier this year by The Dallas Morning News. Many residents view <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as a martyr in an unjust political war. And two of the strongest of possible <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> and Tarrant County Judge Roy English, have indicated they are not interested in the seat. Finally, state Sen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, a formidable Democrat and longtime friend of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, is considered a viable candidate. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the district `` was drawn for the Democratic leadership.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollern </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tarrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called the seat `` marginally winnable.'' The 12th District seat is one of three formerly Democratic seats to be filled in upcoming special elections. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> died May 30 at the age of 88, and Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> announced last month he would resign rather than face an ethics investigation similar to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> indicated last week that Republicans probably would target Pepper's seat more heavily than the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> district. `` You can not attack <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> told The Morning News. `` Anywhere in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, his name is mud, except in the Congressional District 12.'' Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> can set a date for a special election not less than 36 days after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> submits his resignation from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> indicated that would happen by the end of June. Republican officials say as many as 15 potential candidates have begun to scope out potential supporters and financial backers, but the field is not expected to narrow for at least another week. The potential <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates include <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> businessman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McNiel </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully challenged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1986; state Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>; <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, former chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas-Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> board; and former <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>.

 A 2.5 million-gallon tank of methanol set afire by lightning continued to burn Sunday as officials allowed it to burn itself out. `` According to what they say, it should be burned out before daylight,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Iberville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s Deputy <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON>. `` The tank is folding in as the fire burns itself down,'' <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON>, manager at the six-month-old <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant where the tank was located, said late Saturday. He said there was little danger the fire would spread to nearby tanks. Just to be sure, state police said, firefighters sprayed water on the burning tank and another tank of methanol, or methyl alcohol, about 400 feet away to keep them as cool as possible. Damage appeared to be confined to the tank and no injuries were reported. The plant turns natural gas into methanol, a high-quality fuel used for, among other things, drag racers. The fire was reported Saturday afternoon.

 Rebel leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> returned to his homeland Sunday, saying he was ending seven years of exile to join the political fight against the leftist Sandinista government. `` I come ready to contribute to the political opposition through my integration into the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said to reporters at the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> international airport after arriving from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, asked repeatedly by reporters, refused to say whether he resigned from the seven-member directorate of the Miami-based Nicaraguan Resistance, the umbrella organization of the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras. His last meeting with the directorate was `` four or five days ago,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said, adding that he came to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` to devote myself exclusively to the civic political fight.'' The 38-year-old leader said he will not seek an elective post in general elections scheduled February 1990. Another opposition leader in exile, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON>, had been expected to return along with <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> but his absence was attributed to documentation problems. Over the past two weeks two other Contra leaders have returned from exile, both signing an amnesty document saying they do not support armed struggle against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> arrived in a small jet plane provided by the Venezuelan government, said his wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacayo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, who was at the airport to greet him. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> on Saturday and on to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Sunday. Some nine other fellow exiles and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> members returned on a commercial flight about one hour before <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>'s arrival. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> was president of the Sandinista government's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> when he left the country on April 25, 1982.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Sunday ordered the arrest of a prominent dissident hiding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and authorities rounded up more workers and students nationwide who helped lead pro-democracy protests. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said warrants were issued for dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, who were charged with `` committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> took shelter at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> after the army rolled into central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and opened fire on demonstrators June 3-4. Military attacks that left hundreds dead ended seven weeks of protests that spawned demonstrations nationwide and caused a power struggle in which hard-liners emerged in charge. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has strongly protested the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to grant sanctuary to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> announcement. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> already was at the center of a U.S.-Chinese conflict in February when police barred him from attending a banquet given by visiting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, declined to discuss <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s case when asked about it in a telephone interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS program `` Face the Nation.'' He gave no indication he was aware the government issued arrest warrants for <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife. The news of the warrants came as the government intensified its efforts nationwide to round up students and workers who led the demonstrations demanding a freer society and an end to corruption. A heavy troop presence in the capital remained on Sunday, and the government kept up its propaganda effort to blame last week's violence on protesters, urging citizens to turn in anyone suspected of involvement <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted Chinese sources as saying police arrested another leading dissident, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, 44, an accountant, was jailed from 1979-83 for helping lead an earlier pro-democracy movement. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Communist Party chief <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON> reportedly named him as an instigator of the latest student movement in a report to the central government May 19, and <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> had told foreign reporters he feared arrest. Authorities in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> said they arrested the leader of a `` counterrevolutionary clique'' called the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weng </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhengming </PERSON>, and the head of an independent <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> student group, <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzhan </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> was arrested at the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> airport as he tried to board a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-bound </LOCATION> plane and was `` in the company of personnel of the consulate of a certain country.'' They did not identify the country. The government has announced the arrest of only one <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> student leader, <PERSON> Gua </PERSON> <PERSON> Haifeng </PERSON>, secretary of an independent student group that organized hunger strike and marches by tens of thousands of students. Other <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> student leaders were in hiding. Television news broadcasts showed dozens of people being arrested and questioned by police at gunpoint in various cities. Many looked as if they had been beaten, and the face of one man, identified as a leader of an independent labor union, was swollen so badly he could barely open his eyes. One of those arrested was a man accused of `` rumor-mongering'' for telling <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that 20,000 people were killed in the military crackdown. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national television broadcast network footage of the man Saturday and appealed to the public to turn him in. It announced his arrest Sunday in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Dalian </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it was `` deeply distressed to learn that in this instance the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities intercepted unedited news material that was being satellited and used it for political purposes.'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessner </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said that last Monday, World News Tonight used about eight seconds of the tape in a report by correspondent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> and it was one of several man-on-the-street interviews. She said she did not know how the raw footage was intercepted by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities, who broadcast one minute and nine seconds of the man's interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We intend to do whatever we can to protect the identities of those that we interview who feel their safety might be jeopardized or at risk,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wessner </PERSON> said. The government has said nearly 300 people were killed but that most were soldiers attacked by `` ruffians.'' Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources have said as many as 3,000 may have died when troops fired on crowds of citizens. The government issued no figure for the total number of arrests nationwide, but partial figures issued by some cities totaled more than 680. At least one city, the northwest tourist city of <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, ordered its residents to hand over foreign news reports of the attacks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The city government said the materials contained `` distorted propaganda.'' An unspecified number of students from neighboring <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> were arrested in the southern Chinese city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> last week after they protested the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s consul in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanasin </PERSON>, reported. Chinese authorites were in full control of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> after arresting the students from the British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, the consul said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997 and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> in 1999, and the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has created concern in both. Authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which has been under martial law since May 20, issued a new order Sunday calling on anyone who `` burned army or police vehicles, public buses and other public vehicles, or plotted, organized or abetted in providing the conditions for such atrocities'' to turn themselves in for lenient treatment, or expect harsh punishment. Other cities issued similar orders and banned the independent groups that led the protests. In the northeast city of <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION>, authorities held a rally parading 26 alleged lawbreakers `` so the public would ... be educated.'' Mass rallies to parade and in some cases execute suspects were common elements of political control in the past but had become less frequent in recent years. No new protests were reported in any cities. Student protesters in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> had given the government until Sunday to open talks with them on democratic reform, publicize the truth of the military attack in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and fly flags at half-staff in honor of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> dead. However, the deadline passed without new student action. The media stepped up its criticism of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio station, accusing it of distorting the crackdown. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> government sent foreign consulates a letter during the weekend warning that foreign journalists there needed official permission to report. Foreign reporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> already are banned from conducting interviews on the street and most other places.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Offered Wright Deal to Resign, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, not Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, initiated an attempt to strike a deal and negotiate his resignation, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` Everybody made it sound like <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> went in on his knees and asked for a deal,'' one senior <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> source told the newspaper. `` That is the complete opposite of what is true.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported that numerous sources who asked not to be named said the house speaker's resignation began with a call from ethics committee Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>, to Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the former ethics chairman. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation would `` spare the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a harsh and divisive confrontation,'' sources told the newspaper. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the committee could drop some of the 69 allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by accepting portions of his legal motions filed the previous week, if the speaker would agree to resign. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> relayed the message to Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Democrat who joined <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense team several weeks earlier. He passed the information on to the speaker. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who told <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> to go ahead with negotiations, reportedly said he was interested in an agreement if it would clear the names of his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, and friend <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had been accused of providing <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with a phony job and improper gifts. As negotiations continued, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> turned down offers that would have included continuing the censure over the sale of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' and the stipulation that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> step down within 24 hours. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> reportedly said there would be no `` quid pro quo'' agreement for his resignation in exchange for exoneration on charges. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s representatives met with the committee's outside counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said he had votes of all six Republicans and at least one Democrat, Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass., to continue the investigation into other allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for several months When those talks failed, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., then the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader and now the Speaker, was called in as a mediator The relationship between <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had deteriorated to the point that neither man trusted the other, the newspaper reported. Then the ethics committee convened, with some Republicans reportedly angered by the negotiations. But three hours later, the group had heard nothing from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` If he wanted to make an offer, we were sitting there,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Indiana </LOCATION>, who added that he was opposed to any deals. To <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s closest allies, the former speaker was the victim of a `` setup.'' But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> disputed the claim. `` It is quite a typical Democratic ploy once they have lost to claim that they were tricked or the tactics against them were illegitimate,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s decline was inevitable, whether it happened as quickly as it did or not. He was going down.''

<HEAD>Jordanian Foreign Minister Says Iranian Troops in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> says two regiments of Iranian soldiers have arrived in war-ravaged <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Sunday. `` The Iranian military presence in the country is an attempt designed to partition the sovereign Arab state ... through deepening sectarianism, which in turn facilitates Israeli plans,'' he was quoted as saying. The English-language daily quoted him as saying two Iranian regiments had arrived in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that more could arrive soon. But there was no indication when the troops had arrived or how many men were in each regiment. Sources in the eastern <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a fundamentalist stronghold, said 500 Revolutionary Guards had arrived last month to reinforce the 3,000-strong garrison in the area. The contingent has been based there since early 1983, months after the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Their stated purpose was to fight with the Syrian army against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the Syrian troops did not engage Israeli forces. Former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> asked for their withdrawal several times, severing relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the issue in 1984. Relations were restored in 1987. The contingent has been preaching <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s brand of fundamentalism among the Shiites in the Bekaa valley. It has its own radio and television stations. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has allowed increasing Iranian influence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, annoying the many <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states allied with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in a cease-fire last August. Those states oppose the spread <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Shiite Moslem religious fundamentalism. <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> was a member of a six-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee which tried to solve the 14-year-old Lebanese conflict earlier this year. Rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets have been vying for power since September, and artillery duels between their sectors in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has left more than 360 dead in the latest round of fighting that began March 8. An Arab summit late last month replaced the earlier panel with a three-man committee of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s King Fahd, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON>. The summit failed to win <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> agreement to withdraw its 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who are backing the Moslem forces. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> as saying foreign occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could end when the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> can solve <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s political problem and can assure <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> it will not face Israeli threats through <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies a strip of territory in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> suggested Arabs could try to push for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions _ a solution that he said might require increased numbers of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military command on Sunday lifted a weeklong curfew that confined 700,000 Palestinians to their homes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, ending one of the longest restrictions imposed in the 18-month Arab uprising. A curfew remained in effect on the 53,000 Palestinians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp because of clashes there Saturday with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops Two Palestinian teen-agers injured in the refugee camp violence died Sunday of gunshot wounds to the head, an army spokesman reported. He identified the victims as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaweesh </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shama </PERSON>, 17, and said they died at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The deaths raised to at least 516 the number of Palestinians killed since the <LOCATION> Palestininan </LOCATION> uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have been killed in the violence. In other developments Sunday: _ A pamphlet issued by the clandestine Unified National Leadership of the Uprising called on Palestinians to kill one soldier or Jewish settler for each Arab slain `` It is our right to defend ourselves and slaughter our enemy with knives because our blood is not cheaper than theirs,'' it said. _ An <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister discussed the uprising with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politicians and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activist who supports the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> agreed to convene the governing body of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, where he will face a challenge to his peace plan by three of the party's leading members; _ <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists protested a plan to require Arab day laborers to wait in a specially designated `` transit station'' in a town near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>; and _ Another group of eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists who attended a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives in June 1987 were charged by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court with violating the nation's After the curfew was lifted, 4,000 cars streamed out of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> carrying Arabs to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the first time in a week, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The curfew was imposed June 4 at the start of a government campaign to give Gazans computerized identification cards to monitor their travel into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. No violence was reported in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Sunday. <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, the Egyptian minister of state for foreign affairs, began a two-day visit Sunday by meeting <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. They hope <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>'s visit, the first by an Egyptian Cabinet minister in nearly two years, will lead <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to support the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace plan for the occupied lands. After meeting with Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> told reporters: `` I believe that on some of the things where we agree, that we must continue to work together where we can find a peaceful solution to the Palestinian problem.'' <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> also met with <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Palestinian who heads a study center in east Jeruslalem and is a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter. After the meeting <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> told reporters, `` The Egyptian position, I believe, supports the Palestinian position.'' He declined further comment. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the peace plan, which which calls for elections and limited automony in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>, 150 peace activists demonstrated against the town's plan to require Arab day laborers to wait in a specially designated `` transit station.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> put up plastic-roofed shelters on the edge of <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> to prevent <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers from loitering on the streets as they await hiring on work crews. The station was to be used starting Sunday, but a town spokeman said implementation of the plan was delayed while <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members debated it. Police have objected to the plan, challenging its legality. Opponents described the holding area as racist and reminiscent of South African apartheid. `` We did n't believe they would use it,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Eran </PERSON>, a member of the 21st Year group that organized the demonstration. `` It is shocking to think they would.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader, has threatened to resign if the July 2 meeting of the 2,600-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejects his peace plan. His party rivals, Industry and Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, Economics Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON> and Housing and Construction Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, have demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> amend the plan. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> has demanded that the elections be held without international supervision or the participation of the 140,000 Arabs of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Palestinians have insisted on both as a condition for agreeing to elections. The plan is silent on both points, and would have little chance of Palestinian acceptance if <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s amendments are accepted. The charges against the eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists say they met <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and discussed political matters without authorization. If convicted, the activists face a maximum sentence of three years in jail.

 Libyan leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on Sunday praised the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as `` wise and mature'' and said he expected `` balanced relations'' with both superpowers, the official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s comments in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital, appeared to be part of an effort in recent months to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which were sour under former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The Libyan leader spoke to <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, after a ceremony marking the 19th anniversary of the eviction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from bases in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is a wise and mature administration and understands international politics and it is not possible that it will repeat the ignorance of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and it is not possible that it will inflict new damages to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests and foreign policy,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reporter. `` But contrary to that, we believe the new administration will make up for the damage caused to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era and that Great Jamahiriya -LRB- <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> -RRB- will establish balanced relations with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in September that he expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy to change from the strongly anti-Libyan stance pursued under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The Libyan leader has also said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> realized the `` irrationality'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy and would make amends for it. In a January interview, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> called for a dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> must first renounce international terrorism. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has said his country does not practice terrorism. In his remarks to <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> Sunday, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> `` will invite <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet companies to explore for oil and gas as there are massive quantities of these raw materials in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamahiriya </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> -RRB- and perhaps these companies will even participate in water projects.'' There have been reports in recent months that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is trying to induce Americans to return to its oil operations. In his final weeks in office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> oil companies to resume operations in the North African country through foreign subsidiaries. He had forbidden them from working there three years earlier under sanctions imposed on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> held a rally and nobody came Sunday, with the exception of about 100 anti-racism protesters. The Dixie Knights had called the protest against a company that makes kosher foods.

The <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION>'s target had been <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s Foods, a company that produces snacks for vending machines and lunch counters. Included in its line are kosher potato chips. `` We do n't know why they picked us,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Serff </PERSON>, executive vice president of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s Foods. `` Just about every other food company follows the kosher guidelines.''

<HEAD>EPA Orders Halt to Town's Planned Diversion of Rocky Flats Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOMFIELD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> ordered the city to stop digging a ditch to divert water coming from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, despite allegations that the plant dumped hazardous chemicals. Officials of the suburb northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> ordered the ditch dug Saturday, citing federal allegations that the plant had dumped hazardous chemicals into <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which is used for some of the city's drinking water. The allegations were made public last week in an affidavit which also charged that hazardous wastes were illegally burned at the plant. The proposed one-mile diversion would take <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> water around <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION>, where city drinking water is stored, and reconnect with <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION>'s outflow from the reservoir. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Broomfield </ORGANIZATION> officials such a diversion would be illegal because the city of 27,600 residents does not have a federal permit from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. The permit is required to divert any river or stream, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regional director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> asked why the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> can be in violation of the law and it ca n't,'' <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said. `` I told them two wrongs do n't make a right. They agreed to talk with our people on Monday.'' City officials said they intended to go ahead with ditch, which will cost about $ 50,000, but they agreed not to divert any water into it without a permit, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>, city public works director. Only a few yards had been dug on the ditch before the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> told them to stop.

He shook hands with <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> pianist for whom the contest is named, and host <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocarelli </PERSON>, a 30-year-old Brazilian making his second appearance in the competition, won the silver medal. <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON>, a 25-year-old who now teaches in the Italian city where he grew up, was awarded the bronze medal. As the bronze medalist was announced the crowd erupted in wild applause and shouts of `` Bravo!'' <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON> was given a standing ovation. `` In this competition, I wanted to get first prize or nothing,'' the winner said afterward through an interpreter. A native of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON> has played concerts throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and attends <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

Along with his gold medal, the winner of the competition receives $ 15,000, a Carnegie Hall debut recital, concert tours and free air travel. The only other 19-year-old gold medalist in the history of the contest was <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, who won the Third <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> in 1969.

You ca n't compare two completely different ways to play the piano.'' He said a pianist's career is not defined by a competition. `` I think that a career is very long and it does n't matter if you are first prize, second prize, third prize,'' <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON> said. All six finalists were required to play a concerto with the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and one with the Fort Worth Chamber Orchestra. Two of the three Soviet finalists, including <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON>, appeared for their last-round performances Friday. <PERSON> Elisso </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkvadze </PERSON>, 22, played <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major and Saint-Saens' Piano Concerto No 2 in G minor. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtarkman </PERSON>, 21, of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> led off the finals round Thursday with <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s Concerto No. 21 in C major and <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>'s Concerto No. 3 in C major.

At 10:45 a.m. Friday, last rites were administered on <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON>. Forty minutes later, `` a nurse hollered for me to come down,'' <PERSON> Bortmes </PERSON> said. `` I thought maybe somebody passed out. `` We had a steady pulse.

The nursing supervisor, who would not give her name, said <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> never regained consciousness before he died. It was the second death from Friday's accident. The five others suffered burns on their hands and feet when the antenna touched a 7,600-volt power line, the main line serving the small town in southeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>.

 Ethnic rioting that has killed 100 people in the <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> republic has driven nearly 15,000 refugees into a camp where living conditions are so primitive that women give birth on the ground, Soviet media said Sunday. The military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> said mobs of intoxicated residents continue to direct violence at minority Turks in the republic's Fergana valley region. `` The green colors of <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> do not cover the remains of burned-out homes which belonged to Turks not so long ago,'' the newspaper said. `` In some places of the region, clouds of smoke are visible. Numerous are the crowds made up of drunks and people high on drugs.'' The state-run television's evening news program Vremya showed some of the estimated 14,500 Meskhi Turks housed at the camp outside <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> huddled under canvas tents out of the blazing sun. `` The most explosive situation is here, in the refugee camp,'' the report said. A spokesman for the Turks interviewed by Vremya demanded their `` immediate evacuation'' from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to `` save our people.'' The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said conditions are so hard in the camp that `` some of the 20 babies born in the past week were delivered on the bare ground.'' Most of the violence in the cotton - and grape-growing region, about 1,500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, has been directed at the <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, a minority uprooted by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1944 from its homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and forcibly resettled in the Soviet east <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> said about 100 people had been killed in the first days of the week-long rioting, and approximately 1,000 other people wounded. Official media previously reported 80 deaths. From Sunday's Soviet press, it was clear the violence was continuing despite the presence of 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops sent to restore order. But the reasons for the outburst, which officials said began as an ethnic dispute between Turks and the dominant native population, the Uzbeks, were still unclear. <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> quoted Col. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nechaeyv </PERSON>, deputy chief of the political department of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops, as saying: `` We think that the extremists' actions are guided by interested leaders with mercenary goals, which they use vile methods to achieve.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> on Saturday blamed the rampage on outside agitators who came pouring into the valley in cars and trucks. He called them opponents of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, which have brought a crackdown on high-level corruption in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> `` One thing is absolutely clear,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` Evil forces that want to destabilize the situation ... are behind these events.'' But he said he could not yet determine who was responsible. At <LOCATION> Kimyagar </LOCATION> settlement, five miles from the city of <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION>, young people who arrived in cars smashed kiosks and shop windows on Saturday, attacking people who tried to stop them, the labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the young rioters were detained and some admitted that on the eve of their attack, instigators from the city of <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION> came to their region and threatened to set their homes ablaze if they did not set out for <LOCATION> Kimyagar </LOCATION>. But the Trud report, like past Soviet accounts, did not explain why the instigators wanted the Turks attacked. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ansarov </PERSON>, a resident of the village of <LOCATION> Komsomolsk </LOCATION>, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> as saying that on Saturday `` a bus drove into our street. I saw how they took a Turkish boy out of the bus _ he was terribly beaten and covered in blood.'' <PERSON> Ansarov </PERSON> claimed hoodlums cut the ears off a 10-year-old boy in his neighborhood, and said he and his family were saved because they were concealed by their Uzbek neighbors. According to <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION>, 136 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers have been injured since the disturbances began. According to <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, a 200-bed field hospital has been set up at the refugee camp to treat wounded Turks who left hospitals in <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> because they were afraid to stay there. Soldiers guarding the refugees have turned their barracks over to the Turks and moved into tents, it said. But Izvestia quoted <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Usmanov </PERSON> as saying about 20 of the refugees had gone on hunger strike demanding to be taken out of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> altogether. It quoted one old man as saying: `` For how long will we be moved out of our homes?'' <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> said the decision had been taken to evacuate women and children from the camp, and that 400 people had already been airlifted to a children's camp operated by the Ministry of the Interior.

 The first Egyptian Cabinet minister to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in nearly two years met Sunday with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and said any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan must consider `` the legitimate rights'' of the Palestinian people. <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, was greeted at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> who said he hoped to gain Egyptian support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace plan. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, who will spend two days in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, met later with Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>'s visit indicated a new effort to improve Israeli-Egyptian relations that have been cool since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in December 1987. The last Egyptian Cabinet minister to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> in July 1987. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> also met Sunday with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activist who supports the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and is opposed to the Israeli peace proposal for Arab elections in the occupied territories followed by limited autonomy. At a dinner given by <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> said a comprehensive peace `` must take into consideration the legitimate rights, the national rights, of the Palestinian people.'' Speaking before <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was an important factor in the Israeli plan. `` The peace initiative specifically provides for a very important role for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nation that has signed a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> David </LOCATION> accords in 1979. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has urged <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to encourage other Arab countries to join the peace plan proposed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, however, supports an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace that would include the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In an unscheduled move Sunday, <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> met briefly with <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Palestinian politician who heads a study center in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and supports the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oranization </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said after the talks at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s King David Hotel that `` the Egyptian position, I believe, supports the Palestinian position.'' He declined further comment. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s peace plan is for elections in the occupied territories to select Palestinians who would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a type of autonomy. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the plan, saying it ignores <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> aspirations for an independent state. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bars negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with a group of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders Monday and then hold talks with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> said he will deliver a message to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. News reports have said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is seeking a summit meeting with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. The last Israeli-Egyptian summit was in September 1986.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> marched together in an anti-drug parade and rally that drew thousands of people Sunday. The two former Democratic presidential candidates exchanged only a few civilities before <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addressed the rally in City Hall Plaza, urging residents to drive drug-pushing `` terrorists'' out of their neighborhoods. `` We do n't need no police to drive drug pushers out. We must drive them out,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told several thousand people who attended the rally, dubbed <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> or BAD. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was criticized last week for accepting a $ 15,000 fee for the appearance. He said he did not request the money, which came from business sponsors of the anti-drug effort and was offered to him by city officials. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the money would go to his political organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, rather than into his own pocket. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> gets $ 25,000 for his own personal aggrandizement,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, referring to speeches given by the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer. `` It's perfectly reasonable -LRB- to accept the $ 15,000 fee -RRB- and it's a proper thing to do. It came from people who can afford it.'' Before the rally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> briefly marched together in a parade through the city. The meeting was one of the first since between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> since the governor's presidential bid fell short in November. Aides said they shook hands and said hello cordially but did not have time for any substantive discussions.

 The communications industry will grow at an average annual rate of 8.8 percent over the next five years, down from a 9.8 percent yearly growth pace over the past five years, according to a report for release Monday by an investment banking firm that specializes in media buyouts. <PERSON> Veronis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Suhler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the communications business will generate $ 251 billion in spending by 1993, up from $ 164 billion in 1988. It said the projected growth pace will place the communications business second only to the anticipated 9.5 percent annual growth rate in the health and medical services industry among the major segments of the economy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhler </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Veronis </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhler </PERSON>, said the main reasons for the slower growth in communications from 1988-93 compared with the 1983-88 period is an anticipated slowdown in the expansion of spending in cable television, home video and business information. Growth in cable television, for instance, should moderate over the next five years because most households already have access to cable service and basic cable service rate increases are expected to moderate, it said. It put cable spending growth at 7.7 percent over the next five years, down from 11.3 percent in the past five. Home video growth will also slow as that segment of the industry begins to mature, falling to an 11.2 percent growth pace in the next five years from 52.7 percent a year in the past five, it said. Spending on business information services will still be the fastest-growing segment of the comunications business at 10.5 percent a year, but that is down from a 12.1 percent growth pace over the past five years. None of the projections is adjusted for inflation. The forecasters said they expect the economy will grow at a 7.5 percent annual rate including inflation over the next five years, compared with 7.4 percent over the past five years. <PERSON> Suhler </PERSON> said that advertising and promotion spending growth should accelerate in the next five years after slowing in the 1983-88 period when `` the nation's economic focus shifted from expansion to cost control.'' `` Such trends run in cycles, and as this one runs its course over the next five years, higher spending on advertising and promotion will benefit the advertising-supported segments of the communications industry,'' he said. The broadcasting business is expected to grow at an 8.7 percent annual rate from 1988-93, up from 8.2 percent over the past five years. Ad spending on the networks should rise at a 6.9 percent yearly rate over the next five years, up from 6.2 percent over the past five, while spending at local TV stations should edge up to 9.8 percent a year, up from 9.7 percent. The rate of audience decline for the three major networks is projected to moderate between 1988 and 1993 because of lower growth in cable television and independent stations. The networks' share of the prime time audience fell to about 68 percent last year, down from 81 percent in 1983, but <ORGANIZATION> Veronis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suhler </ORGANIZATION> expects it will dip to only 63 percent by 1993. Spending on radio is expected to grow 9 percent a year in the next five years, up from 8.3 percent in the past five, the study said. In the newspaper business, spending is expected to grow at an 8.1 percent rate in the next five years, including an 8.6 percent yearly increase in advertising spending and 6.2 percent annual growth in circulation. That compares with a 7.7 percent growth rate overall in the past five years, including 8.6 percent in advertising and 4.8 percent in circulation. Projections for annual growth over the next five years in other segments of the industry include: _ 9.9 percent in filmed entertainment including home video, down from 17.5 percent in the past five years _ 9.8 percent in book publishing, up from 8.9 percent _ 7.4 percent in recorded music, down from 10.4 percent _ 7.3 percent in magazine publishing, down from 7.4 percent

<HEAD>S&amp;L Bailout Bill Reaches House Floor This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Republicans are telling President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take a hike on his demand that all savings and loan operators put some of their own money at risk as the price for a $ 157 billion taxpayer bailout of the industry. `` The administration is asking <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members to go through the hoop any number of times getting no points for their own parochial interests,'' complains House GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. As the rescue plan moves to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor this week, it was mostly liberal Democrats scrambling to salvage the key reform in the president's package _ making all thrift operators put up real money as capital as a buffer between risky loans and the government's deposit insurance funds <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other industry critics have blamed loose government regulations and accounting practices that have allowed S & amp; Ls to attract and lend federally insured deposits with little or no money of their own at risk as the primary cause of the thrift crisis. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed stiffer capital standards in general terms, it was one of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s most liberal Democrats, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who put a real dollar figure behind it _ $ 1.50 in capital for every $ 100 in loans by June 1991 _ when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed its version in April. The administration immediately embraced <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s measure and asked for more. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> complied, adopting the $ 1.50 standard by 1991 and upping the ante by telling S & amp; Ls they will have to have $ 3 in capital for every $ 100 in loans by 1995 over the opposition of most of its <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members. `` So far it looks like the Republicans are more interested in weakening the president's own bill and the Democrats more interested in helping him,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` We intend to make it somewhat of a political test.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is expected to spend most of the week debating a bill to lift the remaining government price controls on natural gas. Only about one-third of the nation's supply of the fuel is still under the controls. Experts generally agree prices to consumers would not rise if it is decontrolled because current market prices are well below the federal ceiling. However, many acknowledge that anticipated increased demand for natural gas in the 1990s could drive gas prices much higher then. The battle over cash investment requirements for savings and loans underscores one of the differences between banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in general. Even though banks already have twice as tough capital requirements _ $ 6 for every $ 100 in loans and expected to rise to $ 8 in the near future _ many of the nation's biggest S & amp; Ls cried foul at raising their requirements and are engaged in an intensive lobbying effort to knock some loopholes in the bill on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. More than two-thirds of the nation's 2,949 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls already meet the $ 3 capital requirement. Moreover, all but about 250 of those expected to still be in business once the immediate crisis is solved are expected to have little trouble meeting the new standard by 1995. However, about 450 S & amp; Ls now have absolutely no cash capital and it is their losses of up to $ 100 billion in depositors' money driving the emerging 30-year bailout plan that works about to about $ 600 for every man, woman and child in the country. Many S & amp; Ls are meeting the current capital requirements only through `` supervisory good will'' _ an accounting device regulators adopted to encourage healthy thrifts to take over failing <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in the early 1980s. More than 730 S & amp; Ls now hold about $ 20 billion in `` supervisory good will'' exemptions. Effectively, that allows them to lend out $ 600 billion in federally insured deposits with no money of their own at risk. Some of those exemptions were supposed to have lasted for up to 40 years. But the life span of all of them would be whittled down to five years under the bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and endorsed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The fight appears to be centering on an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., to make the government grant hearings to 241 S & amp; Ls now possessing `` good will'' exemptions before making them meet the proposed new standards `` The institutions who relied in good faith on the word of the federal government deserve some consideration,'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, about 40 of them are in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one of the Democrats leading the fight to preserve the tougher capital requirements, said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s proposal could prevent regulators from moving in on unsound S & amp; Ls for up to 18 months `` This will allow the shysters over and over ... to strip an institution of its assets before the regulators could move in,'' he said. `` As we're seeing, it only takes a few bad apples to bring a whole industry down.'' Another fight when the bill reaches the floor Wednesday and votes start Thursday will be over whether to add the immediate $ 50 billion taxpayer share of the costs to the federal deficit.

<HEAD>Apple Commission Rejects Call for Labeling Alar-Treated Apples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a call to put special labels on boxes of Alar-treated apples. Commissioners voted instead Friday to ask growers to approve an emergency assessment of 25 cents a box to pay for additional advertising to move the remaining 1988 crop. Some 12 million boxes of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples are in storage now, about 4.5 million more than last year. To sell that inventory before the 1989 crop arrives will require moving about 682,000 boxes of apples a week, executive director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. That compares to the past two summers' average of 425,000 boxes a week, he said. The emergency assessment must be ratified by growers, and then come back to the commission for final approval. It would be in effect only between July 1 and Aug. 30. The manufacturer of Alar, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced June 2 it was taking the substance off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market immediately to help rebuild consumer confidence. Alar is the marketing name for daminozide, a growth regulator that enhances the appearance of apples and increases their shelf life. It was labeled a possible carcinogen by the private <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in a February report. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> subsequently announced it plans to ban Alar next year. The commission's advertising money is depleted now, but a proposed $ 2 million supplemental advertising program funded by the assessment would promote apples as a portable summer fruit, and try to lure customers with sweepstakes and cash prizes. The commission had sent a questionnaire to growers, asking, in part, whether `` All <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apple cartons should be labeled ` Alar' or ` No Alar' for the remainder of the 1988 crop.'' In the results announced Friday, 689 growers said yes and 734 said no. Several commissioners said they thought segregating Alar-treated apples would be harmful to the industry. They also said it would be counterproductive to the commission's plan to erase the word `` Alar'' the public's mind. The Alar controversy already has cost <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers more than $ 77 million this year, and nationwide has cost growers more than $ 100 million, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> has said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON> has taunted <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s recent takeover bid, telling a company convention crowd that if <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> ca n't join them, `` we'll just beat'em. The thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> distributors roared in approval Saturday as <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON> joked the company's new motto may be `` Sponsor An Avon Lady Today.'' About 7,500 of <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 1 million independent distributors worldwide attended the two-day annual convention at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. The convention, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Ada-based company, comes about a month after <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> teamed up with corporate raider <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> to buy a 10.3 percent stake in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. A week later, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> offered to buy the New York-based cosmetics company for $ 2.1 billion. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> rejected the offer, and in a series of stinging letters to <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> it described the direct-sales company as `` marked by zealotry'' and said such a merger `` would destroy <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s good name.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its offer, calling <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s rejection hysterical, irresponsible and vicious. `` I do n't think we'll have to buy <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, we'll just beat'em,'' <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON> said. After an inspired, evangelical-oriented speech about how <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> distributors are `` life-enrichers,'' <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON> said of the Avon bid, `` We were only trying to enrich their lives.'' <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON>, with company Chairman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Andel </PERSON>, founded the company in 1959 by mixing laundry suds in their basement. `` Instead of seeing what kind of dirt they could dig up, we could have shown them how to clean up,'' <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. The `` dirt'' refers to an investigation <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> launched into <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> operations to fend off the bid. It turned up possible financial wrongdoings by the company's chief executive officer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> also is under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for alleged illegal stock activity in the Amway-Jacobs partnership. <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON> reiterated his support of <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, who orchestrated the takeover bid. The convention also featured two floors of Amway product exhibitions, while singer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Anka </PERSON> crooned for a standing-room-only audience of distributors. In beginning his famous `` My Way,'' <PERSON> Anka </PERSON> took out a sheet of paper on which he had penned new lines to the song. `` How could you flop, when we can shop and not go shopping,'' he sang, ending with, `` You do it Amway.'' The audience responded with a standing ovation. The privately held company, known for its patriotic, pep-rally style, reported $ 1.8 billion in sales in the last fiscal year. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> lost $ 404.5 million in 1988 on revenue of $ 3.06 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> has distributors in about 40 countries and territories, selling 300 household and personal care items under the company name and 4,000 brand name products.

<HEAD>Chrysler Drops Interest-Free Financing For Many Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Analysts say a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to drop 2-month-old interest-free financing on most models may be a sign the No. 3 automaker will adopt other incentive programs. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> on Friday altered the incentive package by offering cash rebates ranging from $ 500 to $ 2,000 and interest rates as low as 2.9 percent for the bulk of its car and truck line. The program runs indefinitely. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s move brings it closer to incentive programs at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said the move could indicate other incentives are planned `` The issue that is facing all of the manufacturers right now is with sales not as high or not responding as quickly to the incentives that have been put out there, the question is what do they do,'' she said. `` Do they have to take them off for a little while in order to be able to trumpet a whole new this-is-it, end-of-the-year clearance? There are going to be all sorts of deals.'' Chrysler began offering interest-free financing on two-year loans for all of its cars and some of its light trucks on April 3. Effective Monday, the automaker said, no-interest, two-year loans would be available only on six cars and trucks. During April, about half of the loans written by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's financing arm, were zero percent, said spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. Figures for May are not yet available, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 2.9 percent and truck sales were up 5.5 percent in April compared with April 1988. Typically, less than 25 percent of the automobile buyers going through financing arms of the Big Three automakers choose two-year loans. <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> speculated that most Chrysler buyers who chose two-year loans already were in the car market, and were ready with large down payments.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million to back out of a deal with chicken processor <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> official says. According to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, chief counsel for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, his <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, Ark.-based company and Omaha-based <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the deal on May 18, the day before the deadline for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' latest auction for itself. However, the morning of May 19, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> `` totally welshed on the deal'' by asking for a $ 25 million deposit that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would have forfeited if <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had failed in its bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON>. The deal having failed, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> increased its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> to $ 70 a share later on May 19, a bid which the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board subsequently accepted and which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the nation's largest poultry processor, has challenged in court. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had agreed, after extensive negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, that `` if we acquired <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> we would require <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> to settle with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> by paying <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million.'' The payment arrangement had been suggested by <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, a major food processor and agricultural supply company, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said that when <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> sought the $ 25 million deposit on the morning of May 19, it made him so `` dismayed and angry and irritated'' that he handed over negotiations to an attorney who represents Tyson in its effort to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>. The attorney's efforts failed to clear the air, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said, and just as the 5 p.m. EDT deadline approached for the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> auction, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> began to transmit via a facsimile machine its bid for the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> company. The fax transmission was interrupted when <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, to renew talks, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said Friday. That effort also collapsed, `` so we turned on the fax machine'' and resubmitted the bid, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. After the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board accepted <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 70-a-share bid over <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 63.50-a-share offer, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> petitioned the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts for relief in the 8-month-old battle for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>. As part of the proposed settlement between <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> would have dropped its insistence on enforcing the asset lockup agreement <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> granted it in November. The agreement gives <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> the right to buy some of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' most valuable assets in the event <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> does not acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, effectively blocking any other company from acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>. The lockup agreement is at the heart of <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION>'s court claims that it has never had a fair shot at bidding on Holly Farms. The three companies are now waiting for a trial date to be set for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s challenge to the lockup.

 An Italian magistrate has charged the head of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant merchant bank, <ORGANIZATION> Mediobanca </ORGANIZATION>, with deceitful bookkeeping, newspapers reported Sunday. Milan Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Gherardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuccia </PERSON> with registering the equivalent of $ 17 million under a false heading in <ORGANIZATION> Mediobanca </ORGANIZATION>'s balance sheets during the years 1976-1980. <PERSON> Cuccia </PERSON> and other bank officials have said they are innocent of the charges. Investigators did not reveal the alleged destination of the funds. Newspapers said investigators believed the money was likely paid under the table to accountants, construction workers or others performing services for the bank. Additionally, the newspapers reported, the money probably was used to give bank employees bonuses and to improve ailing balances of some of the bank's client companies. <PERSON> Cuccia </PERSON>, an 81-year-old financial wizard, has headed the bank, which is part state-owned and part private, since it was founded in 1946. He formally retired in 1982 but has stayed on as honorary president. Investigations into the alledged diversion of funds began about ten years ago and seemed to have reached a halt in 1984, when prosecutors recommended the case be dismissed. <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> magistrates instead continued examining the case and have issued a summons for the elderly banker and four other people who were top officials of the bank during the second half of the 1970s.

 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is `` very upset'' by allegations that millions of dollars were embezzled from the department by private escrow agents, including claims by a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman that she siphoned off $ 5.5 million to give to the poor, a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official said Sunday. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to conduct an immediate investigation of alleged embezzlement in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office and on Friday <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> placed four employees on leave without pay, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel-designee, said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported the embezzlement losses could reach $ 10 million in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, while <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said investigations also were under way in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> about million-dollar diversions. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> has been indicted on charges she embezzled $ 2.5 million from the sale of 55 homes in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area. A two-year investigation in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office led to an inspector general's audit. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, an escrow agent in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> whom federal investigators have dubbed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> HUD </PERSON>,'' claimed that extraordinarily lax management allowed her to divert as much as $ 5.5 million during a four-year period to help feed, clothe and house the poor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I figured that as long as I was going to go to jail anyway, I would help a few people with the time I had left,'' the 46-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, resident told the Times. In a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said that based upon what he has read in the newspapers, `` I'm outraged, and I know the secretary is extremely upset that acts like this could take place, although as noted all of them allegedly took place prior to him taking office.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> would not comment directly on <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>'s allegations. Attempts to contact <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> were not successful. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ordered a full investigation by the inspector general's office and an accounting firm `` to determine the extent of the problem, suggest remedies and construct a system which will make this kind of conduct infrequent if not impossible in the future.'' `` The fact that in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> a closing agent could allegedly embezzle $ 2 million and not be noticed, the fact that in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> a closing agent could allegedly give $ 5 million to the poor and not be noticed shows serious mangement deficiencies, and the secretary intends to see that that conduct does not recur,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. The investigation is separate from a congressional inquiry into allegations that influence-peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> allowed more than a dozen former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials to benefit from housing programs meant for the poor. As an escrow agent, <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> collected money from the sales of property that had been foreclosed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The properties originally had been purchased with HUD-guaranteed loans. Agents such as <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> handle the closing on the foreclosures and turn over the sales proceeds to the government while keeping a small commission. But in 1985, she used some of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to cover a $ 37,000 shortfall in her business, <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. When several months passed without an inquiry from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, it became clear to her the department was so poorly run that it was unable to track the millions in dollars in payments due from escrow agents, she said. She took more money _ as much as $ 5.5 million, by her estimate _ before anyone noticed. Investigators believe she bought 20 homes and nearly 40 automobiles for the needy. She told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Sunday that some of the money may have become `` mingled'' into improvements on her home that included a swimming pool, a $ 2,500 wide-screen television and renovations to her basement. But she said she used her home as a homeless shelter and therefore she could justify the expenses. She said she now has transferred the home to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to offset her financial problems. Her scheme began to unravel last year, she said, when a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, detected the diversion. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> would not comment when contacted Sunday, but his attorney, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>'s suspension was `` an outrage.'' `` Rothshcild is the person who came in and tried to do something about this,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> is chief of the property disposition division of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> was placed on leave without pay along with <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who heads the office; <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, director of housing management; and <PERSON> Charle </PERSON> <PERSON> Womble </PERSON>, a supervisory loan specialist. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> faces questioning by a grand jury in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and says she is cooperating with investigators trying to track the diverted funds. She told the Times she was relieved her activities finally were out in the open. `` Christians are n't perfect,'' she was quoted as saying. `` They're just forgiven.''

<HEAD>Memo Criticizes Bank's Auto Insurance Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> attorney warned in a confidential memo six months ago the bank could be subject to penalties as a result of some insurance charges imposed on thousands of auto loan customers in 1987 and 1988. Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the insurance charges may have been excessive and even illegal, The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which recently reviewed a copy of the memo, reported in its Sunday editions. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said penalties could include heavy fines, forfeiture of interest collected and court-imposed damages. The Press said the Dec. 20 memo cautioned that attempts to correct the problem by refunding money to consumers might result in class-action lawsuits `` by calling attention to the situation.'' The insurance charges in question were imposed on an estimated 22,000 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> auto loan customers, according to the newspaper. The memo was addressed to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangelsdorf </PERSON>, then an assistant vice president in charge of indirect lending. He now works for a bank in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, N.Y. Neither <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Mangelsdorf </PERSON> would comment on the memo, The Press said. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> said in a written response that after `` thoroughly'' exploring the issues raised in the memo, it had concluded its insurance program is in compliance with all laws and regulations. The Pittsburgh-based bank said it removed two of the charges cited by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> from customers' statements earlier this year. The bank said that action reduced the customers' annual insurance premium. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it did so because the charges `` did not offer sufficiently substantial benefits to either our customers or the bank.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that the type of insurance referred to by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> _ collateral protection insurance _ must provide benefits to both consumers and the bank. The insurance plan is called `` force-placed'' insurance. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>, like many lenders, requires new car owners to agree to buy physical damage insurance to protect the bank's collateral, which is the vehicle. Some banks self-insure on such losses, while others write off the losses. If a consumer allows his private insurance to expire, <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> obtains force-placed coverage and adds the insurance premium to the customer's car loan balance. The interest charged on the premium is the same as that charged on the auto loan, <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> said. Under this program, a customer's monthly car payment does not change, so the result is `` a balloon payment'' due when the loan matures, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The interest on the premiums also accumulates until the loan matures. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s program began as a means of cutting high loan losses but quickly became a money-maker for the bank. <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 884 million in 1987 and $ 65 million in 1988, but reported first-quarter profits this year of $ 77 million. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said he recommended Feb. 7 that <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> rescind some of its premium charges and return money to customers. He said he was fired for insubordination two days later. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s account of his firing, calling him `` a disgruntled ex-employee.'' The bank told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was dismissed for `` appropriate business reasons'' unrelated to `` the product in question.'' `` That's nonsense,'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> replied. `` It was related directly to the product in question. My position was that if they -LRB- the legal department -RRB- deemed the product illegal _ which they did _ it should have been discontinued.''
